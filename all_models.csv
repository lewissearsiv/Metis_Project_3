43,US,"Unctuous and ripe in caramel and toasty aromas, this is deep golden in color but completely crisp and balanced in the glass. The nose is so overwhelming that the flavors take time to show. Once they do, it's a celebration of green apple and melon enveloped in complex minerality and a supple body.",US

50,US,"This Chardonnay is rich in all the bells and whistles, such as aging on the lees in French oak barrels. The underlying fruit shows ripe, racy tropical flavors, as well as peach and pear notes that are deep and delicious. With production of 8,400 cases, the wine should be easy to find.",US
51,US,"This wine is as dry as Chardonnay gets, almost severe, with the alcohol an amazingly low 13.2% by volume. The lean, angular mouthfeel provides hints of Meyer lemons, limes and wet stones, with a bit of tropical fruits suggesting that this is California, despite the vintage being the chilliest in memory. Drink it through 2020, but never too cold.",US

Bright on the tongue and on the finish, it's a food-friendly wine that will complement.",US
56,US,"Entirely sourced from this Sangiacomo family-farmed vineyard, which is planted entirely to the Old Wente clone, this wine offers fleshy and tropical juiciness and texture. Aged in French oak, the vast majority of it neutral, the wine lets the fruit and acidity speak for themselves.",US
57,US,"This wine is sourced from a handful of stellar vineyards, including Pratt, Dutton, Sullivan and Chenoweth. It was given 18 months in French oak, all of it twice-used or older, which contributes to an integrated, understated wood presence that's refreshing in its restraint. Creamy acidity and a taste of baked bread cradles lemon zest and almond before a crisp, lengthy finish.",US
58,US,"Ripe fruit and oak loom large in this wine, produced from relatively old vines in the heart of the appellation, long a source for the producer's Pinot Noir. Preserved lemon, fleshy melon and caramel dance around each other, steeped in Golden Delicious apple, honey and pear. A high wire of acidity marks the finish.",US
59,US,"With fresh green-apple aromas, and juicy apple and citrus flavors, this is a lively, crisp and well-balanced wine. Instead of going for overt oaky, buttery flavors and a fat mouthfeel, it stays nicely lean and refreshing, even with relatively full body.",US
60,US,"Slightly oxidized aromas of marzipan, pressed yellow flowers, dried lemon rinds and apricot cream entice the nose on this wine from the historic vineyard by Joshua Klapper. The palate shows woody spice and a unique iodine character, with cinnamon, salt, sour yeastiness and a touch of tart citrus peel.",US

63,US,"Unctuous and ripe in caramel and toasty aromas, this is deep golden in color but completely crisp and balanced in the glass. The nose is so overwhelming that the flavors take time to show. Once they do, it's a celebration of green apple and melon enveloped in complex minerality and a supple body.",US
64,US,"The aromas of this Chardonnay are zesty and fresh yet rich, with barrel smoke, caramelized pear and vanilla tones. The integration continues on the palate, with a bit of oak followed by apple, white peach, nectarine and lime zest. It's flavorful and enjoyable now.",US

66,US,"This is balanced and elegant in subtle pear, ginger and lemon. A fine food wine, it's ideal for roast chicken in herbes de Provence or ratatouille. Located in the Petaluma Gap and the source of grapes for several wines, Sun Chase was bought in 2013 by Guarachi Family Wines.",US

Honeysuckle, almond and Gravenstein apple aromas lead into energetic yet creamy marshmallow and poached pear flavors, all cut with citrusy acidity.",US
71,US,"Minerally on the start, this white progresses into oaky vanilla and brioche notes with a heightened viscosity midway through, before re-finding its vibrancy at the end. In between expect a full-bodied, fruity expression of the variety highlighted by plenty of ripe apple and apricot.",US
72,US,"A blend of three estate-farmed vineyards, this is a velvety-smooth expression of the variety. It conveys a touch more richness and concentration than some of the producer's other wines, at least at the beginning of the glass, when almond and hazelnut rule the day. But then it takes on a lightness toward the lengthy finish, ending in a mix of lemon zest and apple.",US
73,US,"The nose on this appellation blend is full of soft tones of ripe nectarine and pluot, though cut with walnut oil and a citrus edge. It's more pithy in flavor, showing orange bitters, dried apples and more nut oils, slightly oxidative in style.",US
74,US,"Smoky, toasted oak aromas lead to strong char and butter flavors and a viscous texture that clings to the palate. Subtlety is not one of this wine's virtues, as its outsized flavors stand in stark relief.",US

81,US,"Dark gold in color, this wine was whole-cluster pressed and fermented for a lengthy six months, providing for a luxuriousness of stone fruit and melon dripping in honey and caramel. It's ripe and fleshy, with a slight voluptuousness. Aged in 50% new French oak for 17 months.",US

87,US,"This cuvée, says winemaker Josh Bergström, is crafted to compete with village Burgundies. Principally Temperance Hill fruit, it more than does the job, with great mouthfeel, and a succulent tangy ripe mix of citrus and stone fruits. There's a lick of caramel apple coming through also, and the wine is bursting with bright flavors across the board.",US
88,US,"Savory in aroma, richly fruity and accented with butter and vanilla, this wine has a complete package of flavors and an expert balance to accompany its creamy viscosity. It combines lightly toasty, earthy notes with generous pear and citrus flavors in a way that's unusual and compelling. Best after 2020.",US
89,US,"Creamy and lush, this offers currents of tropical coconut complemented by floral gardenia and pear. Made in a fuller style than some of the winery's other vineyard-specific wines, the generosity of fruit is expertly offset by searingly pleasant acidity, sustaining it sip after sip.",US

97,US,"This is unusual for a reserve, in that it's lower in alcohol than the regular bottling, and more cases were produced. The light fruits and herbs—green apple and lemon verbena in particular—are highlighted with tarragon and citrus peel. The complexity compensates for the just-on-the-edge ripeness, and time in 20% new oak adds a buttery note to the finish.",US
98,US,"Lots of purity, with acidity and stony minerality providing earthy balance to the lemon, lime and mango fruit flavors. Thoroughly dry, it's a classy wine to drink now.",US
99,US,"This wine is made in the style of the winery's marvelous Finch Hollow Chardonnays, but is just a little less concentrated. Dry, crisp and elegantly clean, it has complex, mineral-infused flavors of tangerines, peaches and limes, enhanced with lots of smoky new oak. It should hold in the bottle through 2016.",US

104,US,"This stellar reserve remains one of the finest Chardonnays from Oregon. Meyer lemon, peanut oil, salted nuts, citrus and tangerine combine in a deep and intense palate. Whole-cluster pressed and barrel fermented (but in just 10% new French oak), this delicious, dense and penetrating wine should be consumed now through the early 2020s.",US
105,US,"Though labeled Willamette Valley, this is single vineyard Chehalem Mountains AVA fruit.

The acids snap and the finish lingers, with a streak of vanilla and a slight sensation of heat.",US
106,US,"Sourced entirely from the Otis Harlan Vineyard, these vines were planted about 25 years ago. It's a pleasure to see them singled out for this showcase bottling.

110,US,"A solid wine for the price, this begins with honeydew and lime aromas. Flavors start with a spicy cinnamon apple before diving into buttered squash, melon and fresh lime, with a dash of salt.",US
111,US,The new American oak barrel fermentation and aging steals the show on this wine. Notes of vanilla and woodspice overpower the variety's melon and apple aromas and flavors. There are some good things going on but it's hard to get at them.,US

116,US,"The acidity is like a double squeeze of lime juice. It gets the tastebuds whistling, which allowss the intense lemon, lime and mango flavors to spread across the mouth and sink deep into the palate. This zesty wine needs rich fare. Ahi tuna tartare is perfect.",US

118,US,"Bruised apricot, lemonade and citrus rind-laden marzipan notes hit the nose on this wine, which is showing just a touch of nutty, honeyed oxidization. The macadamia nut element arises on the palate too, alongside intriguingly peaty flavors reminiscent of Scotch, with almond liqueur on the outro. It presents decent acidity throughout.",US

The palate is very soft, with ripe fruit such as baked oranges. A nicely buttered touch bolsters the refreshing, mouthwatering acidity.",US
490,US,"Very little of this bottling was made. It's an experiment in making a white wine the way one would a red, fermented with skins and seeds, then aged eight months in new French oak.

The result is a flavor of sour yellow candy, enriched with the creaminess of lees and a buttered toast note from the oak barrels. Drink with rich, buttery shellfish entrées.",US
780,US,"This is a good followup to Merryvale's 2009. While it was barrel fermented in nearly half new French oak, it never feels overly manipulated or fussy. Marked by crisp acidity and Carneros minerality, it's an elegant, clean wine, with subtle Meyer lemon, lime and Asian pear flavors.",US
781,US,"This is a rich, complex Chardonnay that's made to appeal to fans of the variety. Acidity brightens the green apple, peach and pear flavors, while oak brings notes of buttered toast and caramel. The alcohol is a little high and warm, making the wine ready to drink now.",US
782,US,"Savory, cooked apples spiked with apple cider vinegar mark the nose and palate of this simple, homespun Chardonnay.",US
783,US,"Not much going on in this inexpensive wine. It's watery, with a sugary, soda pop sweet finish.",US
784,US,"The oak barrel influence comes across quite strong in this Chardonnay. The wine itself, made from fruit sourced from this mountain appellation in the central part of Sonoma County, is rich in tropical fruit and pear flavors, with zesty acidity.",US
785,US,"Definitely a step up from the regular Chardonnay; this is more substantial, bringing in some mineral, citrus rind and spice along with apple and pear flavors.",US
786,US,"Very dry, acidic and minerally, this is not one of those lush, decadent Chardonnays. It shows controlled flavors of citrus fruits, pears, wet stones and spices. The malolactic fermentation was prevented, giving it tangy acidity. Give it a try with shellfish and roast salmon.",US
787,US,"This is always a gigantic wine, and its success depends on technically balancing its various parts. The 2010 delivers the usual richness, with vast, deep fruit, mineral, oak and leesy flavors. It's as full bodied as a red wine, but a little heavy for a Chardonnay. Not an ager, it's best enjoyed now with the richest Chardonnay-friendly dishes.",US
788,US,"Powerful and intense in flavors of pineapples, mangoes, sweet cream and buttered popcorn, with good acidity. Flamboyant, but it feels over-worked and too sweet.",US
789,US,"Made in the popular style, this sweet, direct Chardonnay has orange, lime and pineapple fruit juice flavors. Crisp acidity gives it much needed zest.",US
790,US,"Made in the simple modern style of lots of caramelized oak and sweet fruit, with no particular subtlety. Shows powerful tangerine, pineapple, apple and honey flavors.",US
791,US,"This shows jelly-like flavors of orange and pear, with some earthy tones. The mouthfeel is soft and there's a bounty of oak in the form of buttered toast and caramel notes.",US
792,US,"A Chardonnay of heightened acidity, this is fresh, light and banced, with tastes of lemon and pear.",US
793,US,"Simple and direct, this tastes like blend of apricots, pears and mangos, with a gentle oak touch. It has pleasant acidity and nice warmth from the alcohol. Drink now.",US
794,US,"The oak is a bit heavy-handed in its buttered toast and caramel flavors. Underneath that veneer is a perfectly nice Chardonnay that has clean, tart citrus, pear and green apple flavors.",US
795,US,"Very oaky and very ripe, offering a flood of pineapple jam, pear, vanilla and toasty oak flavors. Crisp acidity provides needed balance and a clean, brisk mouthfeel.",US
796,US,"Sometimes a reserve designation on a Chardonnay simply translates to excessive use of new oak; here it brings a rich abundance of fruit, along with a density and texture rarely found in domestic Chardonnays. This is a fruit salad of a wine, to be sure, running through a farmer's market's worth of peaches, apples, pears, apricots, bananas and more. But it also brings the butter, the butterscotch and the barrel toast, layered in and wrapped around the fruits so it has the richness of a banana split, and some of the creaminess as well.",US
797,US,"This is a classy Chardonnay. Grown 1,200 feet above Calistoga and fairly well-oaked in new barrels, it's rich and complex, with flavors of grilled tropical fruits and toasted meringue. The structure is greatly improved by a crisp, minerally edge of acidity.",US
798,US,"Structure, minerals and lees mark this elegant Chardonnay. You'll find ripe pear and tropical fruits that taste like they were baked into a pie, but ripe fruit is easy to achieve these days. It's the architectural integrity that makes this wine so fine.",US
799,US,"Dry and balanced, this young wine has a steely mineral tang to the fruitier flavors of ripe yellow apricots, tangerines and baked green apples. Oak adds smoky, spicy wood notes. A very nice Chard at a good price.",US
800,US,"Made in a spare, angular style, this has citrus zest, mineral and pear flavors, brightened by acidity. It's an elegant wine with a creamy, buttery texture.",US
801,US,"This solid Chardonnay brings green apple and melon flavors to the forefront, with just a hint of toast across the back of the palate.",US
802,US,"Great price for a crisp, dry, clean Chardonnay that's so friendly with food. Tart acidity and a touch of smoky oak bring a smoky, vanilla richness to the tangerine, pineapple and pear flavors. Nice with grilled shrimp or mushroom and asiago cheese risotto.",US
803,US,"A bit tart and disjointed now, and dominated by oak, with flavors of butterscotch, pineapples, green apples and cinnamon spice. But it's young. Give it time. Should knit together in early 2010.",US
804,US,"A rich, creamy wine, with flavors of buttered toast, vanilla cream, pineapple and orange. It's rich, but fine in dry acids and minerals.",US
805,US,"A bone-dry Chardonnay for drinking now. This shows great structure, with a keen cut of acidity that brightens the mineral-driven orange and pineapple flavors.",US
806,US,"An eccentric Chardonnay, with botrytis-like flavors of apricot jam and honey dominating, but there also are rich notes of buttered toast and tropical fruit. It's dry and creamy and a little warm. Drink over the next 3 years.",US
807,US,"A bit heavy and creamy, but there's something exotic about the oily, fat richness that suggests cashew nuts. With Meyer lemon flavors, it's an unctuous wine, and a very good value.",US
808,US,"Dry and rich, with bracing acids and minerals, this has complex pineapple, pear and buttercream flavors. It's lovely to drink now.",US
809,US,"An extraordinary Chardonnay whose complicated richness is balanced with tight acidity and a firm grounding of stony minerals. Brings to mind a great Chablis, with its zesty tang followed by elaborate layers of tropical fruits and pears. Utterly delicious, wildly appealing, a wine that will develop bottle interest over the next six years. Only 97 cases were produced.",US
810,US,"Chardonnay doesn't get much riper or richer than this. Dazzles with pear jam, pineapple custard, crème brûlée, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors, and a firm grounding of minerals. Calls for the richest possible foods, like lobster. Drink now.",US
811,US,"The best thing about this Chardonnay is the acidity. It's brisk and clean, and gives a zesty finish to the extraordinarily rich pineapple, papaya, lime and Meyer lemon flavors that are almost sweet, but aren't. A firm scour of minerals adds the necessary grounding to this complex wine. Drink now–2013, but not too cold.",US
812,US,"Silhouette is Merryvale's small-production best of barrels blend from the winery's various vineyards. The '08 is a success, showing brisk acidity and new oak and yeast flavors and a creamy texture framing ripe pineapple, pear and mineral flavors. It's an elegant wine that shouldn't be served too cold.",US
813,US,"This is a distinctive Chardonnay, with pea vine and peach, anise and apple mixing it up. It has a lovely, lifted elegance that keeps the flavors intertwined but allows you to experience them separately as well, and it carves a flavor trail through the finish that lingers sensuously. Could be the best CV Chardonnay ever from L'Ecole.",US
814,US,"This is one of the biggest, richest Chardonnays that Rodney Strong has ever produced, and no wonder, as longtime winemaker Rick Sayre was assisted by David Ramey as a consultant. The wine has Ramey-esque proportions, gigantic in fleshy tropical fruit, caramel, vanilla cream, butterscotch and meringue flavors. It's so softly decadent, it's almost better as a cocktail wine than with food.",US
815,US,"Iron Horse joins the unoaked Chard bandwagon with this dry, complex wine. Their estate grapes are so good, the wine doesn't even need all that wood. It's elaborately tailored in pineapple, mango, ripe white peach and spicebox flavors. The vanilla and smoke, which have got to come from the grapes, add extra deliciousness.",US
816,US,"A smashing success, this exceptional value is loaded with the typical fruit flavors of cut green apple, pineapple and melon. The fruit is set in a creamy frame and finished with beautifully restrained oak accents that support it without burying it.",US
817,US,"Very rich, ripe and oaky, but something of a fruit-oak bomb. Blasts the palate with pineapple jam, toasty meringue, caramel and buttered toast aromas and flavors. Lacks subtlety.",US
818,US,"This is rich and oaky, with ripe orange, pineapple and pear flavors and the buttered toast of oak barrel aging. Almost too much of a good thing, it trades nuance for sheer power, but it's certainly a good example of the California style.",US
819,US,"Beautifully pristine on the nose and palate, with concentrated notes of fresh lemon and apple, with hints of waxy white flower and honeycomb. There's significant weight and body on the palate, amplified by notes of sweet cream, smoke and an umami-rich salinity that lingers on the finish. Fermented entirely with ambient yeasts. Drink now.",US
820,US,"Made in the Ojai style of modest alcohol, dryness and delicacy, this offers subtle citrus, tropical fruit and mineral flavors. It's not terribly complex, but it is streamlined and elegant. Drink up.",US
821,US,"A few years in the bottle are beginning to age this charming Chardonnay, although its brisk acidity and minerality remain. The pear, guava, nectarine and tangerine flavors are just starting to pick up a dried fruit character. Complex and savory, it's a very fine wine to drink now.",US
822,US,"A beautiful Chardonnay, notable for its elegant structure. Perfect acidity and just a hint of tannins, much of it from oak barrels, provide the framework for the pineapple and kiwi fruit flavors, enriched with notes of cream and buttered toast.",US
823,US,"A brilliant Chardonnay showing how well this region can ripen fruit while retaining brisk acidity. Oak barrels add an exotic touch of clove to the underlying pineapple fruit flavors. Feels rich and creamy, and aging on the lees provides a complex touch of sourdough. Drink now.",US
824,US,"A supple, supremely elegant wine, displaying its diverse flavors across a fine mesh. Very pretty aromatics carry a pleasing dustiness, accented with floral, sweetly spicy high notes. The tart fruit mixes citrus, tangerine, pineapple, green apple and pear, and finishes with nicely balanced toast and butterscotch.",US
825,US,"Very dry and a little earthy, with a dusty hay or dried straw quality to the tangerine, sweet lime, lychee, peaches and cream flavors. An interesting, crisp Chard with plenty of nuanced complexity.",US
826,US,"As is usually the case, Bernardus's regular Monterey Chard offers lots of bang for the buck. Dry and crisp in citrusy acids, it has complex flavors of pineapple, grapefruit, kiwi, lime and spicy coconut macaroon, with delicious oak influence.",US
827,US,"No malo in this tight, acidic young wine. It's one of those lemony, citrusy, flinty Chards that will reward aging for 5 or 6 years.",US
828,US,"Cool-climate Chard, with crisp, outspoken acidity and flinty flavors. A scour of fresh lime and mineral hits in the middle, leading to sweet oak on the aftertaste.",US
829,US,"The entry on this single-vineyard Chard is strangely neutral. It's not until the middle palate that a blast of sweet, vanilla-y toasty oak hits, and also pear, mango and spice flavors. From then on, it's a satisfying wine, rich and elegant.",US
830,US,"Has the most delectable fragrance of white peaches and vanilla. In the mouth, the peach flavors are joined by powerful kiwi and pineapple. For all the fruit, the wine is dry, crisp and balanced.",US
831,US,"Here's a full-flavored Chardonnay in which toasty oak plays side by side with big, lush tropical fruit flavors to give plenty of mouth satisfaction. There's a vanilla custard and tapioca spice flavor on the finish that's especially rich.",US
832,US,"Here's a big, extravagant, unctuous Chard that leaves little to the imagination. Everything's oversized and upfront: the massive tropical fruit and spice flavors, the toasty, caramelized oak, the creamy, leesy texture, the finish. It's flashy, but seems to pall after a few sips.",US
833,US,"Butter, pear and cinammon aromas preface tropical fruit on the palate. Feels round and medium-weight, with oak not so obvious until the finish. Even so, Winemaker Cara Morrison says that future vintages will show even less wood.",US
834,US,"Lots of oak on this wine, which shows rich vanilla custard, buttered toast and caramel flavors. However, the underlying fruit isn't able to support it. There's some pineapple and nectarine, but the wine ultimately collapses under all the wood.",US
835,US,"This is a clean, oaky and fairly simple Chardonnay. It satisfies the basic varietal requirements, with pineapple tart, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors. From Testarossa.",US
836,US,"The best Alexander Valley Chardonnays, such as this, show flamboyant tropical flavors. Capture's '09 shows ripe, extravagant pineapple, mango, papaya, nectarine and lime fruit, with a grilled quality baked into a pastry dessert. It's a big wine framed by fine acidity. The oak appliqué is just about perfect.",US
837,US,"A rich Chardonnay made in the popular style. It's almost sweet in pineapple jam, crème brûlée, buttered toast, honey and cinnamon spice flavors, while that bright Carneros acidity keeps it clean and lively.",US
838,US,"This fancy, opulent Chardonnay is made in a certain Santa Rita style of high alcohol, which makes it enormously rich. It oozes pineapple, pear and lime jam fruit, while new oak adds buttered toast flavors and the glycerine from 15.5% alcohol makes the wine even creamier and sweeter. This is an inaugural vintage from the winery.",US
839,US,"This is a wine that offers lots of class at a very good price. It's marked by flavors of streamlined citrus fruit, Asian pear, honey and a hint of buttered toast. It finishes thoroughly dry. With nearly 37,000 cases produced, this should be relatively easy to find.",US
840,US,"Aromatic and refreshing, with scents of white blossoms, stonefruits and a hint of beeswax, this is fermented entirely in stainless steel and meant to be enjoyed fresh and young. Squeaky clean on the palate with hints of white peach, underripe pineapple, lime pith and a bright, lemony acidity that tickles the palate.",US
841,US,"Made in the modern style of oaky creaminess and very flashy fruit, this Chardonnay erupts in a burst of oranges and rum punch, buttered toast and honey. It's rich and layered, if a little soft.",US
842,US,"Floral highlights accent the nose, leading into a crisp and textural wine with pear skin and citrus dominating. This falls on the steely side of Chardonnay styles, offering texture and accents of mineral for added interest.",US
843,US,"Very much like the fine 2009, the winery's new Chardonnay is bone dry and austere, like a Chablis. Highly minerally, with mouthwatering acidity, the fruit flavors veer toward Meyer lemons and limes.",France
844,US,"Concentrated, beautifully defined flavors of pear, apple and ripe pineapple drive a stake through the heart of this wine, blazing a trail across the palate with tongue-thrashing acids and bracing minerality. As it slowly unwinds it reveals a finish of banana caramel tart, luscious and long.",US
845,US,"Shows the softness of Alexander Valley Chardonnay, and the delicious complexity that these wines can attain. Apricots, pineapples, peaches and Meyer lemons are the fruits, framed by vanilla and smoke from new oak, and finishing with a minerality that must come from the earth.",US
846,US,"Clean and varietal. The fruit tastes of ripe apples, pears, and maybe a little bit of pineapple, and if there is new oak it has been gracefully melded into the wine so it does not stick out. Just a hint of sweet toast adorns the smooth, lingering finish; then fades with a lick of butterscotch at the tail end. A graceful, elegant debut for this new Walla Walla winery.",US
847,US,"Fruit from moe than 20 vineyards went into this three-county blend. The result is a beautiful wine. Dry and spicy, it has lush pineapple, vanilla custard, tapioca, peaches and cream and gingerbread flavors, and a lush, creamy texture. Notable also for the crisp, brisk mouthfeel.",US
848,US,"Made from three different appellations, this Chardonnay's cool-climate origins show in the citrusy acidity and rich, tropical fruit flavors that suggest guava and mango. There's also some toasty oak in this tasty wine.",US
849,US,"Simple and fruity, this is a pleasant, easy-drinking table wine. The Barrel Select designation does not mean oaky.",US
850,US,"Shows the ripe pineapple fruit, acidity, minerality and above all sweet, smoky oak that mark a rich California Chardonnay. But there's something off. Hard to say exactly what, but it's in the taste. Like a smattering of mold or shriveled grapes that's off-putting.",US
851,US,"The lime, kiwi, orange and lemon fruit flavors are so delicious, you won't miss the oak accents at all. Its bright, vital acidity makes it shine like polished silver. This is a very good food win at a reasonable price. With 20,000 cases produced, it should be relatively easy to find.",US
852,US,"An eccentric Chardonnay, although it's well made and has intellectual appeal. Bone dry and acidic, this has intense flavors of apricots, pineapples and honey. It should age for up to 8 years, gradually losing fruit and gaining earthy, minerally qualities.",US
853,US,"This is a minerally and oaky wine, but it's balanced with fine acidity. Despite the ripe pineapple and orange flavors, this finishes thoroughly dry. Don't drink it too cold.",US
854,US,"This is a bold, oaky Chardonnay. Toasty roasted-nut aromas lead the charge, followed by hints of peach and melon, while a strong vanilla component comes forward on the palate. Finishes warm, with prominent oak spice.",US
855,US,"Just when this Chard seems simple and sweet, the fruit is overtaken by acidity and minerality, taking the tangerine, lime and mango flavors to the next level and making the wine complex and fascinating. Shows how exceptional winemaking can result in exceptional wine.",France
856,US,"The chardonnay is the largest production wine made at Barnard Griffin. It is a stellar wine, about half barrel fermented, the other half stainless; a beautiful blend of crisp, fresh, creamy, leesy, textural white peach and light citrus fruit. Consistent in style with the winery's Fumé the Chardonnay has plenty of clean acid, great fruit, and a nice butterscotch finish in the back of the throat.",US
857,US,"The grapes got real ripe, to judge by the bright burst of yellow apricots and exotic passionfruits. At the same time, acidity is crisp and citrusy, and there's a pleasant yeasty character, like Champagne, or a nice fino Sherry. The wine finishes totally dry, leaving a palate impression of great elegance. Drink now through 2010.",France
858,US,"This is certainly a better Chard than the winery's '04. It's richer and more succulent, overall more rewarding in varietal fruit, including peaches and cream, pineapples, guavas and papayas, with a cinnamon spice finish. The wine also is characterized by crisp, crunchy acidity that makes it racy.",US
859,US,"Here's a dry Chardonnay, notable for its firm structure. Acidity and oak tannins provide the framework for the candied Meyer lemon, mango, floral, mineral and buttered toast flavors. There's a touch of bitterness in the finish that suggests very modest aging. Drink now through 2008.",US
860,US,"Easily the richest of Schug's current trio of Chards, showing the elegance and crispness of the other bottlings, but with more fruity intensity. It's still a fairly restrained wine, rich in acidity and dry minerality, but rewards with pineapple custard and butterscotch flavors.",US
861,US,"A bit oily textured, with bright lemon and herb notes that add some balance. Citrus is at the core of this wine, which finishes fresh.",US
862,US,"From the cool Green Valley, a wine that didn't get quite ripe this year. There are citrus flavors alongside bell pepper ones and the taste of various herbs. Plenty of oak and lees makes things more complex, but it's still a lean wine that demands foods to wake it up.",US
863,US,"Opens with a blast of well-toasted oak, vanilla, caramel and char, and oak dominates the palate through the finish. Underneath is some ripe peach and pear fruit. The texture is soft and creamy.",US
864,US,"Very rich and fruity, stuffed with pear, peach and mango flavors that go on and on. Oak and yielding acids give this Chard a smooth, creamy mouthfeel.",US
865,US,"Jam-packed with bright fruit flavors of peaches, pears and tropical fruits, and spiced up with the vanilla and toast notes of oak. This is a rich wine, big and bold, and a real crowd pleaser.",US
866,US,"After all these years, Mayacamas still marches to a different drummer. Not for them flamboyant fruit or a heavy plaster of oak. You won't find tropical fruits, scads of spices and vanilla. This wine is tight and earthy, and the dryness is not offset with glycerin or other pseudo-sugars. It's earthy and austere. The point is ageability, if you care to cellar it.",US
867,US,"A pretty wine, with tangy apple and pear flavors that are backed by a core of citrus and herb notes.",US
868,US,"Light and lemony, with a zippy mineral core that leaves the palate bright and refreshed.",US
869,US,"Another winner from this undervalued winery. Consistent with past vintages, this one is ripely fruity, with tasty flavors of apples and peaches and a rich overlay of vanilla and smoke from oak. Crisp acidity keeps it clean and vibrant on the palate.",US
870,US,"Another good value from this winery. The apple and peach flavors have something dusty about them, like dry, red California dirt on a hot summer day. Just a little oak spices up this dry and crisp wine.",US
871,US,"This is a hands-on wine filled with everything toasty oak and lees can add. The underlying flavors are fairly lean, suggesting citrus fruits and a hint of green apple. The result is not a big, fat Chard, but a tight, crisp and elegant one. Perfect with roasted chicken.",US
872,US,"Steely and firm on the palate, with a marked bend toward citrus and herb flavors. Bright and clean on the finish.",US
873,US,"A very rich, oaky-toasty wine with oodles of upfront peach and tropical fruit flavors, but not a lot of depth or complexity. The fruit is big and ripely sweet and impressive, and the oak barrels provide layers of vanilla, smoke and sweet wood-sap nuances. It's all on the surface, but it's a very pretty surface.",US
874,US,"Sweet stuff, with flavors of butterscotch, vanilla and custard. The basic fruit flavors are peaches and pears. No problem getting the grapes superripe in this warm California region. Nice on its own as a sipper, or good with barbecued scallops in a rich butter sauce.",US
875,US,"Bright citrus flavors team up with peach, apple and mineral notes. The wine is a bit racy on the finish; overall, it's sleek and lean.",US
876,US,"A pretty good, everyday Chardonnay that gives consumers the buttered toast and vanilla notes that come from oak, on top of a friendly, pineapple-flavored Chardonnay. A little one-dimensional, but will satisfy lots of wine drinkers.",US
877,US,"A great success in 2008, this compelling Chardonnay offers concentrated, dense fruit flavors of lemon curd and sweet pineapple, along with streaks of vanilla cookie. Nuances reveal themselves through a lingering finish; fresh herb and hints of rock.",US
878,US,"What's so nice about this Chardonnay is the way the dryness, acidity and minerality combine with tropical fruit to make for a splendid, Chablis-style California wine. It's a connoisseur's Chardonnay, requiring some understanding of structure. Don't drink it too cold; could even stand a brief decant at room temperature.",US
879,US,"A modern style coastal Chardonnay, brimming with acidity and starring major league pineapple, tangerine, Asian pear, buttered toast and honey vanilla flavors. Very rich and flamboyant. Calls for a rich shellfish dish in a cream sauce.",US
880,US,"Rich and intricate, a Chard that satisfies with its array of white peach, pineapple, mango, buttercream and spice flavors. Finishes with a slightly sweet, vanilla ice cream flavor.",US
881,US,"Big, rich and oaky, this is packed with flavors of buttered toast, buttered popcorn, honey and tropical fruit flavors. It's a ripe, flashy wine, with broad appeal. Drink with opulent fare, like shellfish risotto or crab in drawn butter.",US
882,US,"Exuberant aromas of white blossoms and ripe stonefruit settle substantially in the glass, revealing a rich yet layered palate that marries sweet cream and butter notes with lemon pith, smoke and striking acidity. Full and opulent, but elegant and balanced. Drink now.",US
883,US,"A solid wine, rich in oak-inspired orange, apricot and Asian pear flavors, with a spicy, creamy finish. The acidity is notable, making this Chardonnay brisk and clean.",US
884,US,"This is yet another superripe, rich and luscious Chardonnay from Chateau Ste. Michelle. It's a tropical fruit-flavored California take on Washington terroir. Plush, smooth and plump, it nonetheless carries its weight well, with an especially fine, lingering finish.",France
885,US,"A very limited production wine from a new Walla Walla vineyard, this was barrel fermented in neutral oak and softened up with partial malo. It leans a bit more toward the citrus/pineapple flavor side than does the winery's regular Chardonnay bottling. This is a bit crisper, with subtle grassy highlights adding some lift and interest.",US
886,US,"This long-anticipated wine from a longtime grower-turned-vintner swings for the fences. Begins with fascinating, complex aromas—highlighted by lees, pineapple, cinnamon, smoke and white chocolate—and dazzles with its sheer opulence. Everything comes together in pinpointed harmony, right down to the mind-bogglingly beautiful finish.",US
887,US,"A clean, correct California Chardonnay, reliable as ever. Pear, peach and citrus flavors go down easily, buffered by graham crackery spice.",US
888,US,"Oak stars in this wine, with its toasty, wood and vanilla aromas and flavors. It's a good wine, but could use greater freshness and intensity, especially at this price..",France
889,US,"This is a pretty good wine. It has the ripe peach, tropical fruit and oaky flavors, creamy texture and oak of top Chards, although there's a homespun rusticity that shows.",US
890,US,"This is the oldest of the Milbrandt vineyards, planted in 1997. Though a bit riper than the Evergreen vineyard bottling, this Chardonnay feels lighter, with less density. It's balanced and complete, and the flavors of green apple and Asian pear offer a fine rendition of well-ripened Washington fruit.",US
891,US,"Apricot jam and late-harvest botrytis flavors are often characteristic of this vineyard. This is bone dry, with brisk acidity and stony minerality. It will gradually lose fruit over the years.",France
892,US,"Citrus and honeydew fruit flavors anchor this unoaked Chardonnay. It has a wonderful leesy texture that enlivens the palate, giving the impression of limestone, or at least lime pulp. Flavors linger, clean and utterly refreshing.",US
893,US,"Marked by zesty acidity and dryness, this Chard shows long hangtime, ripe flavors of pineapples, lemons and sweet green apples. Minerality grounds the fruit, making the wine savory and clean. Gets better as it warms in the glass, a very good sign.",US
894,US,"Produced from this famous cool-climate vineyard, the wine is zesty in acidity and dry, but enormously rich and impressive in pineapple and pear flavors, with a distinct minerality that makes it feel drier and earthier. It's a strong wine, but subtle. Drink now, but not too cold.",US
895,US,"This is a deep gold, scented with cooked apple and pear, and showing some soft, oxidative character from extended barrel fermentation. It is quite accessible, soft and forward, with light hints of tropical fruits leading into a smooth, lightly toasty finish. Definitely a drink-now Chardonnay.",US
896,US,"Lots of acidity in this crunchy wine; this is so tart it's almost like fresh-squeezed lime juice. Fortunately, creamy lees and plenty of new oak add softer, sweeter notes of buttered toast and vanilla.",US
897,US,"Lots of pleasantly ripe pear, peach and apple fruit, with crisp acids and good wood. Easy to drink, with a slight roughness of texture.",France
898,US,"There's a ton of winemaker bells and whistles here, notably oak and lees, but they can't overcome the wine's lean earthiness. The result is unbalanced, although not unpleasurable.",US
899,US,"This white has nice, ripe flavors of peaches and tropical fruits, and good oak. Rich and creamy, this Chard offers lots of pleasure at a good price.",US
900,US,"A medium-weight Chard with mainstream attributes: toasty oak, ripe pears and a plump, custardy mouthfeel. Finishes with a bit of alcoholic warmth.",US
901,US,"This is a blend of several vineyards, instead of the winery's usual single-vineyard Chards. It's been tastefully assembled, and displays good Central Coast acidity framing tropical fruit and oak flavors with a stony, minerally edge.",US
902,US,"A very pleasant Chardonnay that's lifted above the ordinary by a brisk, dry minerality. Orange, lemon and pear fruit stars, with a suggestion of toast and complicated notes of anise, vanilla and cream.",US
903,US,"A light-golden Chardonnay that does its county proud. It's lively and bright, with medium weight and flavors of sweet lemon custard, apple, and a lime-zest-dominated finish. This is a very good wine at a very fair price that should pair with an assortment of dinner fare.",US
904,US,"An exotic Chardonnay, this is reminiscent of a Rhône white wine, with its honeysuckle, mineral, apricot, tangerine and sautéed banana flavors. It's certainly savory. Don't drink it too cold.",France
905,US,"The popular, modern style has dictated the crafting of this wine. It's sweet and delicious in buttered toast, caramel corn and ripe orange and golden mango fruit, brightened with crisp acidity.",US
906,US,"A big improvement over the '08 bottling, the winery's '09 is dry and tart in Central Coast acidity, with pure, clean flavors of tangerine, vanilla and buttered toast. It's a lovely Chardonnay; drink now.",US
907,US,"Chardonnay is the sweet spot in the white wine lineup (along with Riesling, of course). Big, bright and buttery, with plenty of legit oak highlights—none of this fake vanilla or microwave popcorn excess. Bacon fat, smoke and toast match the big, round, rich fruit.",US
908,US,"Oaky, supple and structured, this sturdy Chardonnay is built upon clean green apple fruit and nicely layered toasty oak. It's the same formula as before: one third new French oak, one third malolactic, and nicely expresses open, fruit-driven, barrel-enhanced flavors with crisp citrus fruit.",US
909,US,"Seems a bit tired, with the fruit flavors turning to herbs, dried leaves and mushroom. Finishes dry and clean, with some green-apple notes.",US
910,US,"Kind of sweet and simple, but the very ripe flavors are palate flattering, and it gives nice smoky, vanilla notes from oak.",US

912,US,"Light in flavor, this friendly, everyday Chard shows modest peach, spice and oak flavors and a creamy texture.",US
913,US,"Too leesy and oaky for my taste, with tough, earthy-lemony flavors underneath. Acidity is tart.",US
914,US,"This is an easy, soft Chard, with suggestions of peaches and tropical fruits. There's quite a bit of oak, which adds vanilla and buttered toast.",US
915,US,"This is the kind of Chardonnay that divides wine lovers into enemy camps. Old World purists will criticize the candied richness. New World fans will love the toasted marshmallow, caramel corn and buttered toast flavors that rest on a solid foundation of pineapple and green apple fruit.",US
916,US,"Marked by big, sharp acidity, like biting into a lime, and clean, linear flavors of limes, green apples and pineapples, this bone-dry Chardonnay badly needs food to balance it out. Think of bacon-wrapped grilled shrimp, or a spicy Ahi tuna tartare dish.",US
917,US,"Rich and oaky, with brisk acidity framing delicious flavors of pineapple custard, buttered toast and crème brûlée. Elegant and impressive for drinking now.",US
918,US,"Our first taste of the 2011 Chards from the Finger Lakes, Knapp's Barrel Reserve is wonderfully crisp and refreshing with an abundance of fresh pear and lemon flavor. Subtly oaked with just a hint of vanilla and cream that lingers on the palate. Drink now.",US
919,US,"Soft and creamy, this is consistent with the previous vintage and sets the stage for the winery's bigger, oakier single-vineyard Chardonnays. Mixed stone fruits, pineapple and an elegant, full-bodied mouthfeel make this particularly appealing for the price. It uses the oak judiciously, and avoids the overdone vanilla flavors that many inexpensive New World Chardonnays rely on.",US
920,US,"Notable for its dryness and minerally tang, this is a tight, young Chardonnay right now. The flavors veer toward grapefruits, with notes of passionfruit and honeysuckle. The wine has gone through malolactic, but it's still an acidic wine, almost lean, but elegant. Call it Chablisian.",France
921,US,"From this little RRV sub-region, this is a superdrinkable Chard with lots of interesting characteristics. It has a soft-sharp feeling, a buttery crispness, and the flavors, while on the modest side, are rewarding in tropical fruits and apricots. Finishes dry and complex.",US
922,US,"Alderbrook is one of those insider wineries that does a good job at a fair price. This crisp, dry Chard is an elegant example of the long hangtime '05 vintage, with spicy tropical fruit, butterscotch and vanilla cream flavors.",US
923,US,"This single-vineyard wine from Foxen's estate is a little too sweet. It seems to contain residual sugar, to judge by the jellied pineapple and apricot flavors. If you don't mind that, you'll find a crisply acidic, clean wine, with oak and lees complexities.",US
924,US,"Has all your basic barrel-fermented Chardonnay character without being particularly complex. The wine is slightly sweet and oaky-creamy, with apricot, pineapple, peach and spicy mango flavors.",US
925,US,"For a wine that's been made with a soft touch but still has some weight and finesse, this is a great value. It opens with aromas of ripe peach fuzz and crisp apple, a nice intermingling of flavors. Lemon and grapefruit rind flavors shine on the finish.",US

927,US,"Here's a smooth, creamy Chardonnay for drinking now. It has good weight, with a deep center of citrus, peach and buttered toast flavors. Russian River Valley acidity makes it racy and clean.",US
928,US,"This is clean and dry, with crisp acidity. It's leaner than many richer Chardonnays, but shows plenty of wealth and creaminess, and citrus and pear flavors. A nice partner to roasted chicken or broiled halibut.",US
929,US,"Tart and slender, this is deceptive; at first it seems a little thin, but as it opens in the glass into a succulent, well-defined, racy wine with citrus and peach, mineral and herb. It's not delicate, but its muscularity is concealed behind elegant styling.",US
930,US,"Believe me, you won't miss the oak barrel influence on this wine. It's so good all by itself. Brightened with crisp Monterey acidity and totally dry, it's rich in pineapple, tangerine, Meyer lemon, lime, mineral and vanilla flavors that will satisfy your Chardonnay tooth.",US
931,US,"Shows rich, racy acidity in a dry wine whose flavors veer toward ripe pineapple-tart filling, cinnamon spice and butterscotch, wrapped in a creamy texture. Would score far higher if the fruit were more concentrated.",US

934,US,"This wine continues to be big, with bold fruit and notable oak and lees influence. It's as full bodied as a red wine, with flavors of apricot, orange, buttered toast and yeasty cream flavors. Drink up.",US
935,US,"All the Eight Bells wines show attention to cleanliness and varietal expression. This has a ripe apple flavor, with a lick of minerality on the finish.",US
936,US,"Searing acidity marks this wine, which tastes like it has a lot of Edna Valley fruit in the blend. It also shows bright, strong, long hangtime flavors of limes and pineapples. It's actually quite a fine Chardonnay, dry and low in alcohol. A great value at this price.",US
937,US,"This is a very rich Chardonnay, almost too elaborated and overworked. It's tremendous in oak-infused fruit, with dominating buttered toast, crème brûlée and pineapple pie flavors. Very crisp coastal acidity provides a pleasant balance of tartness. Drink now.",US
938,US,"Brisk and dry, this Chard show an acidic brittleness to the tropical fruit, citrus and hay flavors. It makes up for in balance and elegance what it near misses in sheer pizzazz.",US
939,US,"Big, bold and a little obvious, this Chard's main feature is oak, and plenty of it. Smoky and charry, the wine also has big fruit, along the lines of apricot jam, peach cobbler and pineapples. Don't drink it too cold.",US
940,US,"Earthy and simple-fruity, with way too much toasted oak.  Will have its fans.",US
941,US,"Watery, with an odd medicinal flavor along with the peaches.",US

945,US,"Who knew Ohio made such tasty Chardonnay? Bright and fresh, with scents of green apple, pear, fresh herbs and just a hint of nut oil. This dry, medium-bodied wine offsets juicy flavors of nectarines and apples against a backdrop of sweet cream and white flowers that lingers on the finish. Drink now.",US
946,US,"This impressive Chardonnay from a small Livermore Valley producer is on the austere side of Chardonnay, with notes of just-ripe pear, tiny hints of wet stone, a nice, nutty finish and enough body to go with a wealth of foods. Good balance too.",US
947,US,"Horse & Plow sourced organic grapes to craft this excellent Chardonnay, giving it the luxe treatment—handpicked, whole-cluster pressed, French oak barrel fermentation and aging nine months sur lee—and it shows. The wine is pretty, with a tropical bouquet that gives way to just enough oak-driven vanilla. Will age nicely but is also ready to drink now.",US

949,US,"The reserve Chardonnay is primarily taken from Atlas Peak, but like the regular Chardonnay is entirely barrel-fermented. Hints of butter, marshmallow and spice on the nose give way to flavors of citrus custard and melon on the palate. Finishes with some spicy oak notes.",US

955,US,"A big, strong Chardonnay that's impressive for it's sheer power. This offers in-your-face flavors of pineapple and apricot jam and oak. It's rich and opulent, but lacks some delicacy and grace. Drink now.",US
956,US,"Fresh tropical fruit, peach and apricot flavors star in this flashy young wine. Oak also plays a prominent role, giving buttered toast and caramel notes. And the texture is creamy and smooth. The overall impression is very rich and powerful, but the wine could have more finesse. Drink now.",US
957,US,"Lincourt's grapes are so rich and well grown that they don't even need oak to make a delicious Chardonnay. The wine is dry and crisp, with appealing flavors of pineapples, tangerines and Meyer lemons. The savory creaminess seems to come from aging on the lees. What a great food wine.",US
958,US,"Intensity is the name of the game here. Intensity of fruit, of oak, of creamy lees, of spices, of finish. The lush tropical fruit, vanilla and buttered toast flavors explode in the mouth, leading to a long and rich finish.",US
959,US,"A brilliant success, with concentrated, multi-layered flavors that let the crisp, structured fruit stand out against the tastefully used new French oak. This is as good as Washington chardonnay gets, and clearly deserves its reserve status.",US

964,US,"Lightly floral and quite Burgundian aromatically, this wine exudes a mixture of caramel and earth amid a full-bodied texture and racy acidity.",US
965,US,"This shows that apricotty, botrytised aroma and flavor often found in Santa Lucia Chardonnays from the cooler parts of the appellation, but it's not at all sweet. Instead, it's a bone-dry wine, with vibrant acidity.",US
966,US,"Strives for power in every way, with massively ripe, extracted pineapple, orange and peach flavors, as well as lots of oak. The barrel aging brings butterscotch and caramel notes.",US
967,US,"Ripe and oaky, with juicy pineapple marmalade and butterscotch flavors balanced with crisp acidity, and a dry finish. Easy to like this creamy Chard.",US
968,US,"Sourced primarily from the estate's Carneros vineyards, this is entirely barrel-fermented in French oak. Yet the oak provides gentle accents rather than an outsized coating. Pineapple fruit is lightly touched with hints of vanilla and butter, turning crisp and lemony on the finish.",US

972,US,"For those who love a big, oaky Chardonnay, this is for you. It's raw, blocky and rough, but there is plenty of fresh oak flavor, and time should integrate the wood into the clean and straightforward green apple flavor.",US
973,US,"The Sonoma Valley-based winery has sourced from all over for this wine and from a wide selection of clones. This wine is attractively priced for its crisp and lively golden delicious apple flavors and smoky oak presence. Richly textured, the finish is all about lemon.",US

975,US,"Bigger, with more obvious oak than the CC “regular”, this gets special treatment (hand-stirred for nine months once a week) and 1/4 new oak. It's nicely integrated, big and buttery, with pleasing layers of caramelized sugar and baked apple. A home run.",US
976,US,"Butterscotch, vanilla and spicy anise light up this Burgundian-style chardonnay. Its not-too-ripe fruit flavors of melon and citrus keep it crisp and well-defined, and winemaker David Lake has added just the right amount of toasty new oak.",US
977,US,"The biggest and richest of the three CC chards, this is decadently rich, supple and smooth. It tastes lightly of butter; more of butterscotch. Powerful and expressive.",US
978,US,"There's too much oak for too little fruit in this wine, with the result that it tastes of sappy, smoky toothpicks. Buried under all that wood are modest apricot and pineapple flavors.",US
979,US,"Kind of simple and sweet, like oaky apple and pear juice. Needs greater dryness and complexity.",US
980,US,"There's lots to like in this Chardonnay, from the pineapple, orange and peach fruit, to the creamy texture, crisp acidity and smoky oak. But it tastes a bit jammy sweet.",US

987,US,"Ed Sbragia's inaugural Chardonnay has much in common with the Reserve he crafts at Beringer, but perhaps not as much finesse. Impressive for the huge tropical fruit and overlay of toasty oak, and pretty acidic. Should hold for a few years.",US

992,US,"This is intensely aromatic, with loads of tropical fruit, apple blossom and white peach notes on the nose and palate. It's fresh, tasty and big in body, yet deftly balanced. Soft, lemony acidity on the midpalate gets a boost of citrus rind and saline on the finish.",US

995,US,"Fragrant apple blossom and vanilla custard notes are delightful on this luxurious and balanced Chardonnay. Sweet butter and cream notes on the midpalate add weight, but are offset by brisk acidity and a spray of saline on the finish.",US
996,US,"This El Dorado wine opens with aromas of sweet floral jasmine and is very pretty through and through. Its acidity sings perfectly through the middle of the wine, lifting the flavors of apple and dried apricot as well as the notes of lemon and lime on the finish.

This flavorful example is compellingly rich and textured, yet modest in alcohol, with a happy apple, melon taste and a bit of an exotic lift on the finish, possibly from the 2% Gewürztraminer that's blended in.",US
1065,US,"A rich, oaky, fruity Chardonnay with lots of tropical fruit flavors. Pretty standard, but the price is pretty good for this style.",US
1066,US,"Tastes of perfectly ripened pineapple, pear, lime and peach flavors. On the structural side is fine acidity and a tangy minerality, like a lick of cold steel. Oak is here, notable but perfectly integrated. Give this Chard a little time in the glass to breathe.",US
1067,US,"Lots to like in this ripe Chardonnay. It has fruit-forward pineapple, kiwi and apricot flavors, brightened with citrusy acidity, and enriched by sweet, smoky oak. A rich, elegant wine to drink now with lamb, ahi tuna or by itself as an appetizer.",US
1068,US,"Creamy and polished, with good acidity and pleasant citrus, buttered popcorn and mineral flavors. Could be a little more complex.",US
1069,US,"Nicely dry and crisp, with some good pineapple flavors enriched with oak. Loses points, however, due to a certain vegetal character that's compounded by the fruit starting to fall out.",US
1070,US,"Made in the modern style of lots of ripe tropical fruit, green apple and creamy oak flavors, this Chardonnay is uplifted by bright, citrusy acidity. Drink it now.",US
1071,US,"One of the biggest, boldest, ripest Chardonnays in California, marked as usual by intense flavors, which the winemaker has boosted with oak. Just explodes in pineapple and apricot jam, tangerine custard and buttered toast, brightened by zesty acidity. The wine will age, gradually losing fruit and picking up roasted nut notes.",US
1072,US,An everyday Chardonnay with a creamy texture and oak-inspired buttered toast notes. The underlying fruit has pineapple and orange flavors.,US
1073,US,"From the Langtry Estate in Guenoc, Lake County, this has very intense pineapple on the nose and palate, and is rich and sweet on the finish. Pair it with spicy food or something briny from the sea.",US
1074,US,"A pretty, polished and simple wine that shows the buttery creaminess, toast, popcorn and pineapple jam flavors people like. Easy to find, with more than 17,000 cases produced.",US
1075,US,"Made in an oaky, creamy style to appeal to popular tastes, this Chardonnay has jammy pineapple flavors. It's brisk in acidity and is somewhat simple, but the price isn't bad.",US
1076,US,"Despite vastly rich tropical fruit flavors and plenty of sweet oak, this wine is equipped with brilliant acidity and a stony minerality that give it balance. Kudos to the winemaker for letting the terroir shine through. Will be fine with the richest Chardonnay-friendly foods you can muster.",US
1077,US,"So elegant and sophisticated, this is a great value in California Chardonnay. Although it's dry, it's rich and delicious in pineapples, pears, mangoes and honey, with an opulent overlay of sweet oak. The brisk acidity is balanced, and gets the mouth watering.",US
1078,US,"Tastes tired, with jammy tropical fruit flavors starting to drop out. Still shows vibrant acidity, but the fresh fruit character, the most likeable part of such Chardonnays, is disappearing, replaced by more herbal and vegetal notes.",US
1079,US,"Direct and strong in pineapple and pear jam flavors, this Chardonnay also has notes of vanilla and buttered toast.",US
1080,US,"A simple Chardonnay, with pineapple, apple and mango fruit juice flavors, brightened with zesty acidity.",US
1081,US,"Sweet and appealing, this simple Chard has candied pineapple and lemon cream flavors, accented with crisp acidity.",US
1082,US,"Succeeds in playing the Chardonnay card just where consumers want it. With some new oak, it's packed with tangerine, apricot, green apple and peach flavors, made brisk by acidity, and finished with honeyed ripeness.",US
1083,US,"Good value in a dry, zesty Monterey Chardonnay. Marked by crisp, mouthwatering acidity, it offers simple flavors of tropical fruits, buttercream and vanilla.",US
1084,US,"Lots of ripe pineapple jam and oak flavors on this sweet, creamy wine. Nothing complicated, but good enough to satisfy fans of the variety.",US
1085,US,"Lots of Chard fans will like the ripe pineapple and lime fruit, creamy texture and oaky flavors of buttered toast and vanilla. It's a little sweet, but Central Coast acidity helps to balance.",US
1086,US,"Rich and tangy, a Chardonnay that appeals for its pure varietal flavors and noble structure. It's powerful in pineapple and orange fruit, with a sweet overlay of caramelized oak. This richness is balanced by brisk acidity and minerality.",US
1087,US,"The winery has been consistent with this wine over the vintages, and once again, the '09 is rich and layered. It's brilliant in Edna Valley acidity, showing the long hangtime, ripe flavors of limes, kiwi fruits, oranges and minerals that characterize this region.",US
1088,US,"A distinguished, opulent Chardonnay that's a real testimony to the art of blending. Offers waves of orange custard, sweet pineapple tart, crème brûlée, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors, brightened with zesty acidity. Easy to find, with more than 38,000 cases produced.",US
1089,US,"Simple, soft and sweet, with buttered popcorn, buttered toast and sugared pineapple jam flavors. Nice acidity, though, and a nice creamy texture.",US
1090,US,"Very rich and opulent. You can taste how the grapes had a long season to grow enormously ripe, delivering flavors of pineapples, pears and golden mangoes. Yet the cool vintage also preserved vital acidity. A delightful young Chardonnay for drinking now with upscale fare.",US
1091,US,"Tastes like a fruit juice blend of oranges, peaches and apricots, with a kiss of oak flavor. Standard fare, this boxed wine is the equivalent of four regular bottles.",US
1092,US,"Great acidity and minerality in this elegant young wine. Doesn't show the rich concentration of De Loach's single-vineyard Chards, but then again, it costs far less. It's actually a good value for a dry, minerally and complex Russian River Chardonnay. Don't drink it too cold.",US
1093,US,"There's an unripe, vegetal taste that detracts from the wine's otherwise fine qualities. It's dry and crisp and minerally, with pineapple fruit. But that asparagus edge is annoying.",US
1094,US,"Fruity sweet and cloying, with the flavor of pineapple jam and buttered popcorn and a sprinkle of white sugar for good measure.",US
1095,US,"Feels soft and cloyingly sweet in pineapple jam and buttered popcorn flavors, and is beginning to be tired and old. Drink up.",US
1096,US,"This is a full-bodied wine that belies the notion that Oregon always makes a sleeker style of Chardonnay. Here are ripe, round flavors of peach and mango, wrapped in naturally vivid acidity, with a warming sensation in the finish. Best enjoyed soon, while fresh and young.",US
1097,US,"Cabernet specialist Venge brings its vision of big, bold wines to Chardonnay, with mixed results. The wine is huge and fruity, with massive pineapple, pear, crème brûlée, buttered toast, caramel and vanilla spice flavors, in which oak obviously plays a part. Yet it's almost too much of a good thing. It earns its high score for sheer power, but you find yourself wanting greater subtlely and finesse.",US
1098,US,"Shows the fantastic power and extracted fruit that this vineyard is famous for. Just massive in apricots, tangerines and pears, it's enriched with sweet smoky oak, which adds vanilla bean and buttered toast to the richness. Fortunately, brisk acidity and minerality provide balance.",US
1099,US,"This clean and leesy Chardonnay was fermented half in stainless, half in neutral oak. Its flavors are apple, melon and celery, with a lightly beery, textural mouthfeel that refreshes and lingers. Just a hint of toast comes up on the finish.",US
1100,US,"A good, fairly complex California Chardonnay, marked by ripe, jammy orange, pear and apricot fruit flavors. Winemaker interventions also play roles, with the malolactic fermentation adding buttery notes and French oak contributing sweet caramel.",US
1101,US,"Lots of zesty, mouthwatering acidity in this Chardonnay. The pineapple, crème brûlée, buttered toast and vanilla flavors are so rich that they require balance, which the zippy acidity provides. Maybe a touch too oaky, but that's a matter of personal preference.",US
1102,US,"You can find almost anything you want in this intricate wine, it's that complex. Shows brilliant lucidity and a simple purity, like a Japanese garden. The mineral, wet stone, Asian pear, honey tangerine and lime flavors are so unctuous, it's hard to believe the wine saw no oak.",US
1103,US,"This is the richest of Diatom's 2009 unoaked Chards. It's wildly expressive in tangerines, white truffles and honey, braced with a pleasing minerality. The alcohol is quite high, but an integral part of the wine's oily, glyceriney mouthfeel.",France
1104,US,"Brilliantly clean and pure. Just so expressive and refined, with a crystalline mouthfeel. Rich, alive, vibrant and crisp, with spicy Asian pear and citrus flavors. The finish is dry and long. Just 872 cases were produced.",US
1105,US,"This is a big, vital Chardonnay brimming with fresh acids and oak, whose underlying pineapple, pear and lemon-lime flavors are delicious. Despite the richness, it's dry and crisp in acidity, with a minerally tang. Drink now.",US
1106,US,"From an older block (planted in 1990), this tightly-wound, beautifully-structured Chardonnay brings together tart and tasty orange citrus fruits, wet stone minerality, hints of lime and a core of steel. It's a racehorse, beautifully proportioned, and built for both near term and long term enjoyment.",US
1107,US,"A transparent, translucent Chardonnay whose pure fruit and minerals star. It's unoaked and did not undergo the malolactic fermentation. Shows delicate but complex layers of lime, orange blossom, Asian pear and  lychee, framed in crisp acidity and finishing long and spicy.",US
1108,US,"Firm, spicy and loaded with generous tropical fruits, this has three different clones in the blend, yielding exceptional depth and complexity. The wine moves gracefully from citrus to tropical fruits, with a firm core balanced on juicy acids.",US
1109,US,"An interesting and even somewhat eccentric wine. There are notes of green tea and herbs, but enough pure orange fruit to make it rich. Lots of zingy acidity, too.",US
1110,US,"A very rich Chard made in the modern California style of exceptional ripeness and lots of toasty oak. Tastes full-bodied, almost sweet in pineapple, orange, buttered toast and crême brulée flavors, fortunately balanced with crisp acidity. Drink now.",US
1111,US,"Rich, ripe and tropical, this calls to mind bananas soaked in cream. Round and lightly spicy, it's a forward, fruit-driven wine with a veneer of spice and toast, but enough acid to keep it lively.",US
1112,US,"What a pretty Chardonnay. Complex and intricate, it has detailed pineapple, golden mango and pear flavors that suggest very ripe growing conditions. Yet it's dry and balanced in the finish, not jammy. Don't drink this beauty too cold.",US
1113,US,"Superrich, made in the modern style of exceptionally ripe fruit and lots of oak. Floods the mouth with pineapple, pear, green apple butter, buttered toast and crême brûlée flavors, accented with brisk acidity.",US
1114,US,"Ripe pineapple, orange, apricot and pear fruit joins with toasty oak to make for a pleasantly rich Chardonnay. It's a little forward, but crisp acidity provides stimulating balance.",US
1115,US,"This rich, creamy Chardonnay has fine acidity, while a touch of neutral oak adds a background of buttered toast. But the fruit stars, brimming with papayas, mangos, Meyer lemons, limes and pineapples. The finish is filled with honey, and yet is brisk and dry.",US
1116,US,"Strong and flashy, not particularly subtle, but impressive in sheer volume, which is a mark of many Santa Lucia Highlands wines. In this case, the wine shows brisk acidity that lends clean balance to the huge orange, mango, apricot, vanilla and buttered toast flavors.",US
1117,US,"Made in the ultraripe style that is Williams Selyem Chardonnay, this wine almost needs to be enjoyed by itself as a cocktail. It's explosive in apricot jam, pineapple tart, pear crême brûlée, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors that feel fat and dry and slightly hot in alcohol. Not particularly subtle, but earns points for sheer power.",US
1118,US,"Artesa's dual fermentation approach, in which oak-barrel and stainless-steel-tank fermentation are used, has resulted in this startlingly appealing Chardonnay. Braced with Carneros acidity, it shows mineral-infused orange, lemon and mango flavors, with a smooth coating of toasty oak.",US
1119,US,"From one of the coolest vineyards on the Central Coast, this Chardonnay's acidity is brisk and bright. It provides a balance to the enormously rich, long hangtime flavors of pineapples and other fruits that are tropical in their exotic richness. New oak provides the perfect touch of caramel and vanilla toast. A great price for a Chardonnay this good.",US
1120,US,"You'll find ripe, sweet pineapple, peach and pear fruit in this wine, as well as crisp Carneros acidity. But the oak has been heavily applied, with overpowering buttered toast and caramel flavors.",US
1121,US,"Winemaker Rob Newsom has defined a Chardonnay style that pushes the grape to its ripening limits. Straw gold and bursting with ultraripe scents and flavors, it's a jumble of apples, orange marmalade, and lemon candy. A buttery finish brings olive oil, caramel and butterscotch.",US
1122,US,"This is Talbott's minor bottling of Chardonnay, but it shows the house style. The 2010 vintage was fine, resulting in strong, forward apricot, tangerine, honey and oak flavors, made bold by Central Coast acidity.",US
1123,US,"Shows plenty of ripe pineapple, peach and pear flavors, enhanced with toasty vanilla and oak; rounded out with clean acidity. It's solidly in the modern California style.",US
1124,US,"Solidly fruity, with a mix of apple, pear and peach, this pleasant, easy-drinking Chardonnay plays out broadly across the palate. It is immediately accessible, ready and appears to be at its peak. Light baking spices enhance the finish.",US
1125,US,"Barnard Griffin is family-owned, yet competes, both in terms of price and quality, with the biggest wineries in the state. This Chardonnay is reliable year in and year out, but is especially fine in 2009, with wonderful definition. Fresh herbs, crisp green apple and citrus fruit, a full, spicy, tangy mouthfeel, and above all, a lingering and clean finish, make this a terrific value.",US
1126,US,"Good acidity in this wine, with a pleasant minerality, but it's really too fruity and buttery. Shows little subtlety beyond pineapple, peach and pear jam flavors.",US
1127,US,"New French oak dominates this wine with buttered toast and caramel flavors. Despite this heavy hand, the underlying wine somehow shines through, with orange, mango, pear and peach flavors, brightened with brisk acidity.",US
1128,US,"Rich in tropical fruit and citrus flavors and generously oaked, this Chardonnay is made in the modern style, designed to appeal. It's dry and properly crisp, with a fine minerality, but is overworked. You can feel the heavy hand of the winemaker.",US
1129,US,"A rich, smooth and spicy Chardonnay, very minerally and crisp, with flavors of wet stone, peach, citrus, white pepper and smoky wood. Feels tight and elegant and complex in the mouth. More food friendly than some of the creamier, sweeter Chards out there.",US
1130,US,"A good, brisk Chardonnay that provides nice drinking now and has extra layers of elegance and complexity. The wine shows the fresh acidity of its cool-climate origin, and very ripe pineapple and peach flavors that come from a long, clean vintage. Don't drink it too cold, as it gets better near room temperature.",US
1131,US,"Dry and somewhat herbaceous, this Chardonnay has some good pear, melon and orange fruit, but otherwise is missing out on opulence, especially at this price. New oak, to the tune of 40%, contributes buttered toast and caramel, but the wine needs more than that.",US
1132,US,"A soft, silky scent to open, weaving a tapestry of floral, musk, lemon polish and apple notes. The wine has excellent concentration, a dense midpalate bringing vanilla cream and banana and other tropical fruit flavors to the front. Powerful, with a hint of volatility.",US
1133,US,"Aggressively oaky in the nose, it follows with a buttery, oaky palate that shows little fruit beyond green-apple tartness.",US
1134,US,"Oaky on the nose, but with the ripe firm fruit to support the barrel flavors, this hits the palate bang on with a powerful load of ripe apple, stone fruits, toast, spice and plain old oak. It's a style that is becoming standard for Ste. Michelle Chardonnays, a forceful, very ripe, big flavor approach that may benefit from decanting in order to smooth it out.",US
1135,US,"With just a hint of oak, this Chardonnay is all about fruit and acidity. It's dry and crisp, with a firm, clean mouthfeel, and pleasant citrus, apple, pear and mineral flavors.",US
1136,US,"A pretty lemon yellow, this organically-grown estate reserve has juicy natural acidity, and tight, tart citrus fruit that zips around lemon, lime, white peach and a hint of pineapple. The barrel flavors are generous but not overblown, and the structure suggests it will keep well for 6–8 years.",US
1137,US,"There is a somewhat disjointed aspect to the mouthfeel of this wine, and some light and unusual floral scents that don't follow through as flavors. Clean, simple fruit and light cracker flavors come and go rather quickly. Two bottles tasted.",US
1138,US,"A solid everyday Chardonnay, showing good pineapple, peach and pear flavors, with a nice edge of buttered toast and vanilla.",US
1139,US,"Buttered toast, caramel, vanilla bean, spice and pineapple and orange jam aromas and flavors mark this wine. It's a little sweet and white sugary on the finish.",US
1140,US,"The first impression is of grain and soda crackers. The wine is tart, with a mix of orange peel, baby aspirin and lemon custard flavors. It finishes rather sharp-edged, with a hint of heat, and a lot of acid.",US
1141,US,"Too oaky, dominated by butterscotch, caramel and buttered popcorn. Somewhere underneath all that you'll find a good, pineapple- and orange-flavored Chardonnay.",US
1142,US,"Oak, in the way of vanilla and buttered toast, dominates. Underneath are simple pineapple and apricot flavors that are watered down on the finish.",US
1143,US,"This is a distinctly simple Chardonnay. It's marked by pineapple, pear and peach flavors. Will satisfy America's basic Chardonnay craving.",US
1144,US,"Shows lots of new oak in the buttery toast and sweet vanilla char flavors that ride high over the pineapple jam, soft ripe pear and papayas. A clean, creamy Chardonnay for drinking now.",US
1145,US,"The clever label reads “Original Flavor—Unoaked” and the wine has not a hint of anything other than bare-bones apple-flavored fruit. It's simple, light and balanced.",US
1146,US,"Blatantly appeals to the popular style, with pineapple jam, vanilla, honey and buttered popcorn flavors. Shows brisk acidity and a certain minerality.",US
1147,US,"Not much going on besides lots of toasty oak, buttered popcorn and caramel aromas and flavors. Somewhere down there is pineapple and lime fruit.",US
1148,US,"Your basic California Chardonnay, soft, with oak-infused pear and orange flavors, brightened by pleasant Carneros acidity.",US
1149,US,"A simple Chard, with vanilla, buttered popcorn and pineapple jam flavors.",US
1150,US,"This is a big, rich, oaky Chardonnay. It's a little heavy with all that caramel and buttered toast, but acidity brightens the pineapple and peach flavors, and the finish is clean and spicy.",US
1151,US,"Tart in acidity, this has strong flavors of caramelized oak, pineapple jam, green apples and buttered toast. It will satisfy your Chardonnay sweet tooth.",US
1152,US,"An exotic, dry and crisp Chardonnay, with plenty of toasty oak. Shows a mélange of dried orange, pineapple and pear fruit, with a minerally note. There's a feral quality that may be the result of native yeasts. Drink now.",US
1153,US,"A delicious Chardonnay made in the California style of ripeness. It's fortunately balanced with acidity, which balances the sweet pineapple and honey flavors, but needs to be a bit drier.",US
1154,US,"A good, everyday Chard. It's sweet in caramelly oak, vanilla, buttered toast, pineapple jam and butterscotch flavors, with just in time acidity to make it finish clean and brisk.",US
1155,US,"Very ripe in fruit, with good acidity and lots of smoky oak. Made in the jammy style of California Chardonnay, it has sweet flavors of pineapples, papayas and buttered toast. Drink now as a cocktail, or try with a rich shellfish risotto.",US
1156,US,"A solid Chardonnay, dry, oaky and rich, with nice, crisp acidity. Satisfies for its creamy wealth of pinapples, limes, pears and minerals.",US
1157,US,"Crisp and spicy, with juicy apple and pear fruit flavor, this easy-drinking Chardonnay was aged sur lie in mostly used barrels. There's a subtle suggestion of vanilla and butter woven into the finish.",US
1158,US,"This rich, oaky Chardonnay has aromas and flavors of buttered toast, buttered popcorn, vanilla and pineapple jam. It's very rich and creamy, and appeals for sheer deliciouness.",US
1159,US,"Too much oak on this Chardonnay. It's dominated by the aromas and flavors of buttered toast and caramelized, vanilla accented wood. Underneath all that are some pretty good pineapple, peach and pear flavors.",US
1160,US,"Fresh, appley and floral with a touch of tangy yogurt cream, this is an approachable yet elegant Virginia pick. Delicate apple and pear flavors shine through on this full-bodied wine with fresh acidity, supple texture and balanced alcohol.",US
1161,US,"Surprisingly full bodied, fruit loaded and instantly appealing, this new Chardonnay from Hogue mixes generous flavors of apple and butter, toasted almonds and a little spice.",US
1162,US,"Fancy and oaky, with crisp acidity balancing strong pineapple, green apple and new oak flavors. A modern style Chardonnay to drink now.",US
1163,US,"Shows all the hallmarks of a fine Chard, except complexity. It's dry, creamy and smoky in oak and lees influences, with flavors of pineapples and peaches. Easy to find, with 250,000 cases produced.",US
1164,US,"A nice, smooth Chardonnay, with ripe fruit and cream and lots of oaky buttered toast. Made in the popular California style.",US
1165,US,"This is one of the most Chablis-style Chardonnays on the market. It's bone dry, and has a steely, minerally elegance made complex with layers of pineapples and limes, and even a honeysuckle richness. The oak, interestingly, comes from Hungary. A terrific wine, far from the overoaked, buttered popcorn style so popular now. Production was only 227 cases.",US
1166,US,"The vineyard is in the coolest part of the Green Valley of the Russian River Valley. The wine, which is totally dry, is marked by brilliant acidity and long hangtime flavors of oranges, Meyer lemons and kiwi fruit, enriched by barrel fermentation and aging.",US
1167,US,"Hints of freshly pressed apples and pears in a darkly toasted oak barrel come through. Deft use of new French oak results in a full-bodied wine with a lush, buttered toast richness that highlights sweet apple and lemon flavors. The finish is clean and lemony with a slight saline touch.",US
1168,US,"A modern, popular Chardonnay made with very ripe tropical and pear fruit flavors and a strong oaky influence. Not very subtle, but will satisfy fans of the style.",US
1169,US,"Sweet in honey and caramel flavors, but balanced with crisp acidity, this everyday Chard delivers strong pineapple, lemon meringue pie and peach flavors.",US
1170,US,"This is a bottling that has lost or given up considerable quality over the years. It now has a mass-produced, industrial feel. Made in the popular style, it's creamy, sweet and ripe in citrus, tropical fruit and oak flavors, with no particular complexity.",US
1171,US,"It's unbelievable that this Chardonnay is unoaked, it's so incredibly rich and creamy. Just packed with layers of tropical fruits, peaches, Asian pears and oatmeal cookies. All that butter and cream must be from the malolactic fermentation and aging on the lees. One of the best unoaked Chardonnays ever.",US
1172,US,"Another good value from Bogle. This Chardonnay is creamy and sweet in pineapples, pears and buttered toast, but has zesty acidity. Production was 250,000 cases.",US
1173,US,"This Chardonnay was blended from several vineyards in Dutton's extensive portfolio. It's not only a great example of the art of blending, it's a fine wine in itself, showing brisk acidity and dryness, with rich, complex orange, Meyer lemon, kiwi fruit, honeysuckle and buttered toast flavors.",US
1174,US,"Here's a find for lovers of big, buttery wine. Dripping with cream and butter, Tarara's darkly toasted, full-bodied Chardonnay screams new French oak. Rich and viscous, there's just a hint of fresh lemon and apple flavors hiding behind all of the oak.",US
1175,US,"Soft and simple, this has apricot, peach and cream flavors that finish sweet and jammy.",US
1176,US,"Good acidity in this Chardonnay provides a brisk balance to the ripe pineapple, passion fruit, pear and spice flavors. Made in the modern style, it has a minerality that lifts it and provides interest.",US
1177,US,"Is that a touch of botrytis on the nose? Or does that apricot come from the Rued clone of Chardonnay? Either way, this dry wine offers vastly complex layers of fruits, spices, minerals, white flowers and smoky new oak. It's exotic, a Chardonnay that marches to a different beat and demands some understanding on the part of the taster.",US
1178,US,"This sweet, oaky and simple Chardonnay has soft flavors of pineapple and caramel.",US
1179,US,"A little sweet and rustic, but rich in pineapple jam and buttered toast flavors. Brisk acidity helps to balance out the sugary taste.",US
1180,US,"Lots of oak on this Chardonnay, but it's awkward, and feels overworked and sweetly simple, despite some pretty pineapple jam flavors.",US
1181,US,"The nose is a tad high-toned, like apple juice concentrate from a can. It's full bodied and dry, with just a touch of sweetness on the palate, with a savory apple flavor that ends with a tart, green apple skin note.",US
1182,US,"Luscious, rich, balanced and intensely fruity, this stunning effort may well be the best Chardonnay ever produced in Washington. Two-thirds old- vine Celilo vineyard grapes are blended with estate-grown fruit from even older vines that were planted in 1976. Candied citrus, especially Meyer lemon, lemon verbena and other fruity herbs, stone fruits and subtle layers of caramel and toast burst from the glass. But the most amazing thing is that this wine stays fresh after being opened for literally days, much like a grand cru Burgundy.",US
1183,US,"Fresh and firm, with juicy primary fruits that meld together flavors of tropical and stone fruits—a riot of papaya, peach, pineapple, candied lemon and more. The butterscotch barrel notes glide into the mid-palate and coat the back of the throat, resonating long after the wine is swallowed. Based on previous vintages, this is a surefire six to eight year wine for cellaring.",US
1184,US,"This is the first all-estate-grown Chardonnay bottled by Woodward Canyon since 2003. Fermented in one-year-old Burgundy barrels, it's a Washington Chablis that brings exceptional focus and persistence to bear on flavors of intense citrus, honeyed candy, orange peel, spice and even a slim hint of chocolate. The mix of fruit, herb and mineral combines to create a terroir-laden wine that is beautifully complex and proportioned.",France
1185,US,"Very acidic, giving the ripe tropical fruit and green pea flavors an almost sparkling spritziness. But very rich and flamboyant and complex. This wine was tasted at just about a year of age, and should calm down by summer 2012.",France
1186,US,"Acidity and ripe fruit mark this Chardonnay, which is lovely to drink now. Don't chill it too much, to allow the orange, pineapple and passionfruit flavors to express their nuances.",US
1187,US,"As before, this features fruit from Conner-Lee, here with some Lewis vineyard grapes added to bring in more minerality. The result is a well-crafted mix of grapes from these two premier vineyards, with a tight core of chalk-laden citrus fruits. Persistent and resonant, the fruit is edged with citrus skin and brings a pat of butter at the end.",US
1188,US,"Sure is easy to like this Chardonnay, with its rich flavors of honey, pineapples, peaches, crême brulée, vanilla and cinnamon spice. It seems almost sweet, but zesty acidity and minerality pull it back into dryness and elegance.",US
1189,US,"Big, round and lush, this is the fourth vintage for this wine, one of the best Chardonnays in Washington state. In this vintage it did not go through full malolactic, leaving a nice underlying acidity with a leesy, creamy freshness. Golden apples, stone fruits and a lick of butterscotch add to the luscious, generous finish.",US
1190,US,"Good price for a Napa Chardonnay this rich and balanced. It's enormously ripe in pineapples, oranges and golden mangoes, but grounded by zesty acidity and a minerality that comes from the soil.",US
1191,US,"This dry, acidic, minerally Chardonnay brings Burgundy to mind. It has a lot going for it, but is rather tight and angular despite a rich vein of pineapple and lemon drop. Distinguished in its way, it's a fine wine, at a great price.",US
1192,US,"This bottling has been variable over the decades, but this 2010 shows fine form, a good sign coming on the heels of the excellent 2009. It's richly oaked and flashy in pineapple jam, buttered toast and creamy, yeasty flavors.",US
1193,US,"Acidity is the best thing about this Chardonnay. Without it, the tangerine, apricot and lime flavors, accented by sweet oaky vanilla, would make it a mere fruit bomb. Tartness wakes it all up and makes the finish clean and pure.",US
1194,US,"Made in a bone dry, acidic style, what this Chardonnay lacks in richness it makes up for in elegance. Fans of sweet, buttery Chards won't like it, but true aficionados will appreciate the austere citrus and mineral flavors.",US
1195,US,"Rich and oaky, with pineapple jam, tangerine juice, buttered toast and vanilla spice flavors. It's a big, opulent wine, but a little in your face. Drink now.",US
1196,US,"Made in the popular style, this Chardonnay has flavors of buttered toast, pineapple jam, vanilla and cinnamon spice. At the age of three-plus years, it's soft and mellow. Not likely to improve, so drink up.",US
1197,US,"Chard fans who are tired of soft, flabby wines will welcome this dry, crisp bottling. The underlying grape flavors offer lime, Meyer lemon, mango and steely minerals, while winemaker bells and whistles bring needed layers of buttered toast and vanilla cream. A beautiful, classy and elegant Chardonnay; production was only 400 cases.",US
1198,US,"Ojai is making Chardonnays in a drier, leaner and lower alcohol style than many others, but the wines reward for their extreme elegance and Chablisian minerality. This one, from a cool vineyard within sight of the Pacific, is streamlined, with flavors of citrus rind, tapioca and oak, and is very high in mouthwatering acidity.",US
1199,US,"Oak dominates this Chardonnay in its buttered toast, caramel and butterscotch flavors. Buried under that are pleasantly ripe pineapples and lemons. The winery suggests it will age through 2020, but that seems doubtful.",US
1200,US,"Limited production (just 1,800 cases) and special handling (native yeast, barrel fermented, lot selection) make this the prestige Chardonnay offering from the entire Ste. Michelle portfolio. Much of the fruit is from original (1973) plantings at the Cold Creek vineyard, and gives the wine depth and resonance. This vintage has had plenty of time to absorb the new oak and integrate the flavors, and is drinking beautifully.",US

1205,US,"If you like the Ojai style of dry, austere, flinty Chardonnays, go out and find this one. It's a good approximation of the winery's more expensive bottlings, with intricately woven citrus, wet stone and spice flavors, brightened with lots of zesty acidity.",US
1206,US,"Bonterra excels with this leaner, lighter, brighter form of Chardonnay. Made out of organically grown grapes, it's crisp as a green apple, with just a trace of butterscotch on the otherwise lemony finish.",US

1209,US,"A nicely done wine, especially at the price. It's very pretty aromatically, boasting pear and vanilla notes, full in the mouth and lemony with minerality. “Jam” of Jam's Blend is a commingling of the names of the two Tortoise Creek founders, Janie and Mel Master, who source the grapes for this wine out of a Lodi Rules vineyard.",US

1213,US,"This is a big, barrel-aged Chardonnay resplendent in caramel and honey, although it turns a bit bi-polar on the mid-palate, where it shows off lean minerality. A yin and yang wine, with a slight burn on the finish.",US
1214,US,"Made in the popular style, with flavors of buttered popcorn, toast, honey, pineapple and vanilla. Tastes rather sweet, but brisk acidity helps maintain balance.",US
1215,US,"Seems like it might have been better a year ago. Although you'll find rich pineapple, lemon drop and butterscotch flavors, they're getting a little tired, and the oak is starting to dominate.",US
1216,US,"One of the best Chardonnays available at this price. Shows welcome restraint in the crisp, clean flavors of pineapples, Meyer lemons, pears and green apples, with just a touch of oak. If you just judge by price, you'll be amazed how complex and layered it is.",US

1221,US,"Though it's had some extra time in the bottle, the oaky edges of this wine still seem a little rough and tumble. Or maybe it's the banana cream pie flavors—appealing in their way, but opposite end of the spectrum from, say, the minerality of a Chablis. Front loaded, creamy and rich, this has generous amounts of the oak and toast that many consumers crave.",US
1222,US,"Overworked and oaky, with vanilla, buttered toast and sweet caramel flavors dominating everything else. Buried beneath are pineapple and pear flavors.",US

1224,US,"There's little if any oak on this Chardonnay, which allows brisk Central Coast acidity and bright, long hangtime fruit to star. And that fruit is rich, suggesting tangerines, nectarines, Meyer lemons and Asian pears. Very nice with crab risotto, or with a beautiful roasted chicken.",US

1243,US,"Take a few bucks off the price, and this would be a good value. As things stand, this Chardonnay, which is a blend of Santa Clara Valley and Santa Cruz Mountains fruit, is fairly standard. It's dry and crisp, with pleasant lemon-custard flavors that turn a little unripe on the finish.",France
1244,US,"Toasty oak, pineapples, oranges and vanilla combine in this Chardonnay to make it an easy-drinking everyday sipper. It seems little sweet, like jam.",US
1245,US,"Not much going on in this heavy Chardonnay beyond the oak. There are modest pineapple and peach flavors, but they wash away quickly.",US

1249,US,Too oaky and forward in tropical fruit flavors. Takes the popular style and exaggerates it. It will nonetheless appeal to lots of people.,US
1250,US,"Strong scents of oak and butter come rushing out of the glass, with a medicinal edge. Though it has had some bottle age, this wine has not yet knit together. The ripe, soft, banana-flavored fruit and the forceful oak components are distinct and separate. Try it with pasta or poultry in a rich cream sauce that can pull everything together.",US

1257,US,"Abeja's Chardonnays are as certain to hit their target as a Kobe Bryant slam dunk, and the style remains consistent vintage after vintage. Spicy, nutty, based around stone fruits and melon, they do not shy away from the toasty flavors that derive from barrel fermentation in 40% new French oak. The underlying minerality and well-balanced acidity mark this as Washington fruit, most of it from the outstanding Conner Lee vineyard.",US
1258,US,"Quite young and tight, with primary apple, melon and stone-fruit flavors, this is that rare domestic Chardonnay that surely will reward cellaring. With decanting it becomes creamier, with an aromatic lift of cinnamon and a thread of vanilla running through the toasty finish. A baby, but already delicious.",US
1259,US,"J Winery goes against the grain of the modern high alcohol, superripe style to produce this bone dry, steely, somewhat austere young Chardonnay.

1262,US,"With exceptional dryness, acidic crispness and minerality, this Chardonnay can be described as Chablis-style. The structure is certainly noble, and nobody would ever accuse it of being a fruit bomb despite the rich pineapple tart and lemon drop flavors. Hard to predict its future, but probably best over the next four years.",US
1263,US,"If this Chard had any more oak, the forests of France would be denuded. But the buttered toast and caramel work well, adding even greater richness to the huge pineapple, lemon custard and gingersnap cookie flavors. Drink this extravagant Chardonnay over the next six years.",US

1268,US,"Tastes a bit remote and hard now, with a steely minerality that accentuates the acidity, and even boosts the tannins. Underneath that are clean, vibrant pineapple, Meyer lemon, golden apricot and lime flavors. This is one of the rare California Chardonnays that should improve with some age. Hold for 3–4 years, maybe even longer.",US
1269,US,"Smooth and spicy, matching bright, tight, sweet-tart lemony fruit to nicely integrated barrel notes of sandalwood and graham cracker. The sleek structure, balanced for cellaring as well as immediate enjoyment.",US
1270,US,"Not much going on with this dry, crisp Chardonnay. It has watery flavors of citrus fruits and apricots, with a hint of oak.",US
1271,US,"Thin and generic, this could be any basic white wine. It's got a splash of Sauvignon Blanc and Gewürztraminer in the blend, but falls flat in the mouth, with a little celery and green apple flavor quickly fading.",US
1272,US,"Pretty standard Chardonnay, with a creamy texture and flavors of buttered popcorn, caramel corn and pineapple Life Savers candy.",US
1273,US,"This vineyard has proved itself for so many years that it's practically a guarantee of greatness. This 2008 is a real stunner. It's so rich and exotic, so balanced and dry, so clean. Dazzles with pear, pineapple, lychee, roasted hazelnut, crème brûlée, buttered toast, honey and spice flavors, wrapped into a creamy smooth mouthfeel. Brilliant and compelling. Drink now.",US
1274,US,"It's easy to get ripe fruit in California and then plaster it in oak, but what's so difficult to achieve is the crisp, minerally structure this wine displays.

Only 349 cases produced.",US
1275,US,"An awesome Chardonnay that gives everything you want in richness, yet frames it in a structural integrity rare in California.

1277,US,"From a very cool vintage, this wine takes full advantage of the flavors the year delivered.

Complex and textural, this is a lovely wine.",France
1278,US,"A brilliant Chardonnay, brimming with powerfully ripe tropical fruit and pear flavors, enriched with smoky, sweet oak. The key here is acidity and the minerality that accompanies the best Santa Lucia Chards. Drink this flamboyant wine now for maximum vibrancy.",US
1279,US,"Very much in line with SEV's fine 2009 Chardonnay, this is sourced from the Lewis Vineyard. Instantly round and fruity, it offers up a ripe mix of oranges and apricots, backed with juicy acidity. Then it brings in the butter, toast and nuts—a full-bodied, extremely generous wine.",US
1280,US,"A near replica of the wonderful 2007, and an equally powerful value. Enormously rich and attractive in pineapple cream, golden mango, lemon chiffon pie, buttered toast and dusty spice flavors; crisp Central Coast acidity makes it alive and vibrant. Only 400 cases produced, but worth the search.",US
1281,US,"Awesomely rich, showing fine acidity and a stony minerality that ground and anchor it, but really notable for the explosive tropical fruit, apricot, pear and buttery oak flavors that are so opulent. The wine went through a complete malolactic fermentation.",US
1282,US,"Very opulent, almost too much so, with a flood of Key lime pie, pineapple jam, orange, butterscotch and buttered toast flavors that overwhelm in richness. The saving grace is a fine structure of acidity and minerals and a finish that strives to be dry. Drink now with shellfish, roast pork, or all alone as an apéritif.",US
1283,US,"Shows lots of fruity richness, with Asian pear, pineapple, peach and green apple flavors, brightened by crisp acidity. It's surprisingly fresh for a 2008 Chardonnay, but you should drink it quickly before it starts to go downhill.",US

1292,US,"Tastes honey sweet in butterscotch, buttered toast and caramel. The sweetness dominates well ripened pineapple and tangerine flavors. But the fruity power is there.

1300,US,"This falls right in the toasty, oaky style of almost all the Chardonnays from winemaker Bob Bertheau, wrapping bright apple and citrus fruit in layers of toasty, nutty, buttery oak. A reasonable expectation is that additional bottle age will smooth it out and push the fruit more forward.",US

From Talley, and made from their vineyards in the Edna and Arroyo Grande valleys. Good price for a Chardonnay this elegant.",US
1303,US,"Light and frothy in the glass, this beautifully perfumed dry sparkling is redolent of orange blossoms, apples and pears.

1596,US,"This fruity and full-bodied wine offers much to like. The opposite of crisp and lively, it was made in an unabashedly ripe and rich style. Pear and butter aromas lead to ripe peach and vanilla flavors. The texture is rich in the mouth and the finish is soft.",US
1597,US,"Creamy, yeasty lees, 100% new French oak and intense tropical fruit, apricot and pear flavors combine to make this barrel selection from the estate vineyard dramatic. It's dry, complex and delicious. The 2010 vintage was a successful one for Marimar Chardonnays, and while this is a delicious one to drink now, it will improve with an additional 5–6 years.",US
1598,US,"Tart with acidity but lush with fruit, this is a lovely Chardonnay to drink with shellfish dishes. Honeyed notes accompany flavors of tropical fruit, Meyer lemon and lime. Oak lends touches of vanilla and a creaminess that finishes clean.",US
1599,US,"Still young and tight, this terroir-driven Chardonnay needs further cellaring to show its best. Woody scents top off crisp, persistent tree fruits, with lemony acids propping up flavors. It's dense, compact and unyielding, but clearly the raw materials for ageworthiness are there.",US
1600,US,"Tastes manipulated, with oak, honey and buttercream flavors dominating the underlying apples and peaches.",US
1601,US,"This is made from fruit that was sourced from the same vineyard and picked at the same brix level as Foundry's Stainless Chardonnay bottling. But here the toast of new oak adds a lovely flavor to the smooth butterscotch and apple notes. It opens gracefully and quickly, but the Stainless bottling has more grip and complexity.",US
1602,US,"Made from fruit that was sourced entirely from the 1.5-acre estate vineyard, this limited-production, Dijon-clone-based Chardonnay captures the essence of the Abeja style. Complex, stylish and buttery, it's a striking, fruit-laden wine. The long, clean finish mixes a flavor of citrus rind with a streak of butterscotch.",US
1603,US,"Focus and elegance are the hallmarks of this wine, and it offers the fruit purity that characterizes virtually all of Maison Bleue's white wines. From the first sniff to the last, resonating swallow, this smells and tastes like a bowl full of peaches, pineapples and mixed stone fruits. It's tight and defined, and it doesn't have new oak influence.",US
1604,US,"The oak—all French—is out front with notes of toast, crème brûlée and spice along with peach and lemon. It's light in style with a warm finish.",US
1605,US,"A squeeze of lime acidity gives balance to honeyed orange, pear, Meyer lemon and vanilla-custard flavors in this wine. Nothing complicated here, just plenty of Chardonnay appeal.",US
1606,US,"Aromatic for the variety, this wine shows notes of apple and pear. It's lightly spritzy with an almost unctuous feel.",US
1607,US,"Pineapple, pear and straw aromas lead to sweet, medium-bodied fruit flavors. It's a straightforward, varietally correct quaffer that goes down easy.",US
1608,US,"Tropical with notes of gingerbread and vanilla, this wine tastes full bodied despite its medium level of alcohol. It offers a reduced note on the finish, anchored otherwise in sweet toffee.",US
1609,US,"Named after a trail in the Grand Canyon, this Napa-made bottling shows Japanese pear and cracked vanilla candy on a complex nose. It offers ample amounts of minerality, from slate to chalk, on the palate, followed by smoked stone fruit in the middle and pencil-lead elements toward the finish.",US
1610,US,"This older-vine vineyard a few miles from the ocean delivers a layered nose of steely minerality, chopped herbs (oregano, basil, thyme, even rosemary) and a poached apple background. The slightly watery palate seems to be hiding a bit, but patient searching reveals some of the herbals as well as light touches of toasted almond and lemon rind. This could emerge into a classic wine, but it's hard to tell now.",US
1611,US,"This wine offers caramelized apple, seared pear, honeysuckle, a touch of buttercream and vanilla ice cream on the even, well-measured nose. The flavors lean more green but not underripe, with lime juice, green apple and green mango, offering some bitterness and an alkaline/iodine character.",US
1612,US,"Done in a more oxidized style, this wine shows marzipan, dried apricot, browned butter, dried pineapple and a gunmetal flint character on the nose. The palate is very focused, with flavors of preserved lemon, lime rind, sage-roasted chicken and a faint minty element.",US
1613,US,"Sugary flavors of orange and apricot jam mark this simple wine. It's oaky and creamy, with good acidity.",US
1614,US,This frothy Chardonnay is rich in baked honey and oak with a sweetness at its core. Otherwise it feels a bit over the top.,US
1615,US,"With apricot, orange, honey, butter cream and vanilla flavors, it's a simple wine at a fair price.",US
1616,US,"A bit heavy, soft and dull, it has dried herb, green pea, oak and tropical fruit flavors, without much complexity. It's all right for drinking now.",US
1617,US,"Still young and tight, this terroir-driven Chardonnay needs further cellaring to show its best. Woody scents top off crisp, persistent tree fruits, with lemony acids propping up flavors. It's dense, compact and unyielding, but clearly the raw materials for ageworthiness are there.",US
1618,US,"This is Marimar's unoaked Chardonnay from the estate vineyard. In keeping with past vintages, it's so rich and savory, you won't even notice the absence of barrel influence. The wine is rich and complex in tangerine, apricot, lime, lemon and vanilla flavors, brightened by exquisite acidity.",US
1619,US,"There's so much age present on the nose that this wine seems like it could be a couple years older: candied quince, pralines and cream ice cream, toffee and singed marshmallow. Once sipped, the age is not quite as present at first, with poached pear leading the way and the marshmallow elements in the background. On the finish, there is noticeable booze and wood. It is probably passing its peak.",France
1620,US,"The nose promises so much that it's not surprising when the flavors overdeliver. The aromas include intoxicating rose, stargazer lily and apricot brandy. Next, the viscous palate combines buttered bread, hard orange candy and powerful vanilla. There's not a lot of acidity and the result is nearly cloying.",US
1621,US,"You'll find tropical fruit flavors in this Chardonnay, but they're not strong enough to stand up to the weight of oak. It's a little too soft as well. Disappointing.",US
1622,US,"Although the 2010 vintage was cooler than the previous two years, this Chardonnay still offers rich and luscious notes of crème caramel and baked pear. The intoxicating bouquet picks up layers of lemon zest and mineral.",US
1623,US,"Racy, clean and seemingly bone dry, this wine is elegant and almost shy in its approach. Food friendly and Chablis-like, it has plenty of citrus, cream, mineral and toast subtleties. The fruit was sourced from a vineyard located in the westernmost part of the valley, and hence one of the coolest. Drink now–2018.",US
1624,US,"Part of a Limited Release series, this is an all-stainless Chardonnay. Ripe, tart and focused, it offers spicy bursts of yellow and green fruits, and it shows a sur lie-derived texture. The pinpoint details are gorgeous.",France
1625,US,"Buttered toast, vanilla cream, honey and jammy pineapple, lime and mango flavors give this Chardonnay incredible richness. Monterey acidity balances the palate briskly. Not particularly subtle, but a big, enjoyable wine.",US
1626,US,"A unique blend of fermenting orange, aging white flowers, dried apples and a musky sandalwood show on the nose of this wine. The palate is simultaneously rich, sour and creamy, with tangerine and banana flavors.",France
1627,US,Watery pineapple and peach flavors have a heavy jacket of oak-like smokiness. Acidity provides a clean mouthfeel.,US
1628,US,"Green, vegetal flavors mar this wine. While it's nicely dry and crisp in acidity, and offers modest green apple and mango flavors, the unripeness is hard to like.",France
1629,US,"Full-bodied in apple and pineapple aromas at first, this Chardonnay with 5% Viognier blended in veers into marshmallow sweetness with a fatty finish.",US
1630,US,"Tasted in early February, this Chardonnay had some secondary fermentation in the bottle, giving it a bubbly feeling. This major flaw may disappear in time.",US
1631,US,"This is an estate wine from Marimar's Green Valley vineyard. It's very good, with mouthwatering acidity and rich, complex tropical fruit, green apple and lime flavors. Oak brings rich notes of caramel and honey. The alcohol is nice and low.",US
1632,US,"An exquisite Chardonnay, among the winery's best since 2007. It offers rich, complex flavors of tart green apples, limes and kiwis, with honeyed oak notes. It's all balanced with crisp acidity and a steely minerality.",US
1633,US,"This wine delivers everything you want in a California Chardonnay. While it's dry, it's incredibly rich in tropical fruit, green apple and pear flavors, with loads of honey and buttered toast from oak barrels. The acidity is just fine.",US
1634,US,"There are candied tangerine notes on the tight nose from this twist-off bottling from William Foley's first winery, Lincourt, named after his two daughters. On the palate, the slight minerality washes around lime freshness and a just-ripe green pear tang, an introductory example of leaner, acid-minded Chardonnay. Pair with shellfish appetizers or a halibut main course.",US
1635,US,"A solid Chardonnay, made in the popular style. It delivers the expected flavors of tropical fruits and peaches, buttered toast, cream and smoky oak, in a one-dimensional way.",US
1636,US,"Another clean, brisk and slightly sweet Chardonnay from Cupcake, at a pretty good price. Its shows orange, peach, vanilla, buttered toast and white sugar flavors.",US
1637,US,"A solid Chardonnay, showing good varietal character at a fair price. It's a little lightweight, but the cream, peach and citrus flavors are just fine.",France
1638,US,"A rich, oaky style of Chardonnay that spent five months sur lie in neutral French oak. The wine has a soft, mildly sour taste and lurking wet stone notes.",US
1639,US,"An awkward Chardonnay. It's strong in apricot flavors, suggesting some overripeness, while the vanilla and butterscotch give it a candied, fruit juice sweetness. Drink up.",US
1640,US,"Take Souverain's basic Chardonnay, released last year, oak it up, and you get this reserve. Buttered toast, butterscotch, apricot, tropical fruit and honey flavors are prominent. Ready to drink now.",US
1641,US,"Toasted nuts, seared marshmallows, roasted corn and dried apple play on the nose of this richly layered wine. The palate shows plenty of lively sea salt from front to back, along with concentrated citrus character and an apple-syrup ripeness.",US
1642,US,"A majority of new French oak nestled this wine, contributing to its dark golden color and oak intensity on the nose and palate. Slightly sweet in ripe apple and vanilla, it will benefit greatly from the enjoyment of food alongside.",US
1643,US,"This barrel-fermented Chardonnay, from the oldest plantings (1972) in Washington State, displays exceptional concentration and palate weight. Apple pie, pear tart, baking spice, butter and caramel flavors abound. It's rich and packed with fruit, along with the seductive flavors that aging in new French oak can provide.",US
1644,US,"Crisp green apple, lime and vanilla wafer mingle on the palate of this 100% Chardonnay, méthode champenoise sparkler from the Bazzano Vineyard. It drips with minerality, lively and tangy with a medium to light body that picks up depth and breadth on the finish.",US
1645,US,Enticing aromas like baking spices and a vivid mix of fruit and spice flavors are carried along beautifully by lively acidity matched with luxurious body. This tastes subtly and attractively oaky and has considerable complexity and length.,US
1646,US,"Floral and accented in papaya, this is a crisp, balanced and easy-to-love wine, from a vineyard farmed organically and biodynamically planted to three different clones. Fig, pear and vanilla all make an appearance amidst a medium-bodied texture and crisp, appealing finish.",US
1647,US,"A creamy, unctuous white with a tease of waxy apple, cheese rind and tropical pear, this fuller-bodied expression of the grape takes on generous layers of caramel and ginger as it goes. It finishes in a long, lingering celebration of brioche and allspice.",US
1648,US,"Winemaker Ehren Jordan makes this wine with purchased single-vineyard fruit from old vines. The wine is concentrated with flavors of lemons, limes, tropical fruits and apricots, and liberally enhanced with oak. Drink it over the next few years.",US
1649,US,"Beringer reaches into the cool, southerly Oak Knoll district of Napa Valley for this dry Chardonnay, which shows tart flavors of lemons, apples, limes and minerals. It's an elegant Chard, light but complex, with beautiful acidity and just a touch of oak. Dungeness crab with buttered sourdough bread would be a perfect pairing.",US
1650,US,"A zesty honeydew and tropical, nearly pineapple soda nose starts this wine. On the palate, there is apple pie and brisk, fleeting pineapple, but not much lasting acidity. A very easy-drinking deal, especially for the price, that will pair well with everything from seared scallops to roasted chicken.",US
1651,US,"Fresh apples and cream meld on the nose and palate of this creamy, richly textured Chardonnay. It's densely structured with bold alcohol and generous swathes of oak, but crisp acidity adds levity and elegance. Finishes moderately long.",US
1652,US,"Tastes like toothpicks, with buttered toast, butterscotch and vanilla flavors dominating everything else. Somewhere underneath is some tangerine and mango fruit.",US
1653,US,"A tropical Chardonnay with a full-bodied personality and aromas of vanilla and caramel. Priced fairly, it'll please California Chardonnay fans who like a bigger style.",US
1654,US,"This focused effort features fresh-cut apple and pear flavors that are spicy and tightly wrapped with a Bourbon-barrel-like accent. Delicious now, but it can be cellared for a decade at least.",US
1655,US,"This is a simple, clean, well-balanced, all-purpose Chardonnay. Light streaks of honey, lemon and vanilla run through crisp, apple-flavored fruit. Nothing fancy, but solid and reliable.",US
1656,US,"Soft and buttery, this drink-now style is as smooth as a polished stone. The fruit is fairly generic and light, but the penetrating punch of popcorn and nut oil carries it along nicely.",US
1657,US,"The fruit is the star here, ripe and round. Flavors are a nice mix of orange, apple and pear, with a light dusting of baking spices. This is drinking at its freshest peak.",US
1658,US,"Softly sweet, this brings bright Fuji apple and Anjou pear aromas and flavors. It charms with fresh fruit character and stays away from the dry balance of more serious wines.",US
1659,US,"This shows a bright yellow-gold color and light lemon and butter aromas. Pronounced butter, lemon and almond flavors almost overwhelm the lean texture. Tart in taste and light in texture, it refreshes the mouth.",US
1660,US,"This well-made wine in a rich style smells like ripe pears and melted butter, and tastes soft and almost sweet, resembling pear and peach juice. The texture is smooth and soft and the body is medium, so it's easy to enjoy.",US
1661,US,"Light and crisp, this wine offers the freshness of orange rind and lemon, both aromatically and on the palate. It's refreshing and not overdone.",US
1662,US,"This wine is made from a single clone grown in a single vineyard, then aged sur lees in French barrels. It starts with a complex bouquet perfumed like a Gewürztraminer, the palate crisp and lowly impacted by oak.",US
1663,US,"This barrel selection offers aromas of peach, apple and lime sorbet, with a sharper sense of dried herbs as well. The palate delivers high-tone flavors of chopped dill, tart apple, lime peel and cut grass. A lean and focused wine.",US
1664,US,"This aromatic wine carries notes of movie theater buttered popcorn, peach and lees. It's full bodied with buttery stone fruit flavors that show a considerable amount of creaminess and elegance.",US
1665,US,"Offering deep complexity, this bold, brazen wine is decadent in caramel and toffee aromas and flavors, with a foundation of ripe Gravenstein apple and hazelnuts. The oak is pronounced but it adds more than it subtracts. Cellar through 2018.",US
1666,US,"This brilliant wine is dry and tart in acidity, minerally, and supremely refined in Meyer lemons, pears, limes and tart apples. It's not one of those fat Chardonnays that melts in the mouth, but instead has firm texture and elegant complexity. It makes a beautiful accompaniment to grilled salmon, crab cakes, or a simple but glorious roasted chicken. Don't drink it too cold.",US
1667,US,"A subtle, herbal wine, this offers cool vintage flavors of cucumber, jicama and green apples. Complex notes of almond, mineral and fresh herbs extend the palate impression. Baking spices and a streak of caramel roll on through the finish.",US
1668,US,"“No oak/No malo” the label proclaims, as if to challenge you to like it anyway. What's not to like? Fresh, leesy notes cleanse the palate, and set up the palate for the mix of melon, blood orange and pineapple that defines the flavors. Without any oak or buttery malo, what persists is the vivid, supple acidity.",US
1669,US,"Whiffs of smoke and earth meld into pretty aromas of white flower, apple and lemon on this ripe, richly bodied Chardonnay. Layers of cream and stone fruit build on the palate, but are balanced by a brisk lemon-toned acidity. Drink now while young.",US
1670,US,"For people who like wines that speak a little softly, try this very moderately priced Chardonnay. Subtle aromas and flavors of green apple, honey and almond build slowly as you enjoy the light to medium body, smooth texture and a finish that hints of sweetness.",US
1671,US,"Nuanced in amped-up ripe pineapple, stone fruit and toasted honey, this is a balanced Chardonnay, well made from good fruit. It offers a taste of vanilla cream on the full-bodied finish.",US
1672,US,"A simple wine, it tastes overoaked and thin in oranges and apricots, with brisk acidity.",US
1673,US,"Sourced from 35-year-old Wente clone vines, this offers bright apple with hints of peach. It's medium bodied and streaked with flavors of caramel and butterfinger candy.",US
1674,US,"Unoaked, and instead fermented for 10 months in both stainless steel and concrete egg, this white remains light-bodied and crisp, touched by aromas of honeysuckle and refreshing flavors of pear and quince.",US
1675,US,"Notes of Meyer lemon and orange blossom meld with accents of fennel, spice and glazed apple. The medium-bodied palate feels glossy, and comes with balanced acidity. A delicate wet-stone minerality marks the finish.",US
1676,US,"Vanilla cream, honey and tropical-fruit flavors mark this Chardonnay, which was fermented and aged in stainless steel. It's a straightforward wine, for drinking now.",US
1677,US,"This wine is made from a single clone grown in a single vineyard, then aged sur lees in French barrels. It starts with a complex bouquet perfumed like a Gewürztraminer, the palate crisp and lowly impacted by oak.",US
1678,US,"Sweetly exotic in fresh-squeezed pineapple aromas, this wine might be trying too hard to be light and restrained, employing very little oak in the process. Pear and lemon stay on the palate the longest, the finish brisk in acidity.",US
1679,US,"This shows fresh, crisp apple and lemon-cream aromas, with clean appley flavors and buttery accents. Medium bodied, it tends toward the soft, rather than crisp, side. Lively fruit flavors make it refreshing.",US
1680,US,"Slightly sour elements of lemon and lime meet with a riper nectarine tone on the nose of this wine. There is good citrus-driven acidity on the palate with limeade flavors, though it trends a bit sour and wipes up with not much finish.",US
1681,US,"Crisp and fresh aromas of lime sorbet and iced apple flesh greet the nose on this Riboli family bottling. The palate is steely and bright, with Anjou pear flesh, a bit of smoke and some red-apple ripeness.",US
1682,US,"Simple and cloying in white sugar notes. Too bad, because there's good acidity and succulent citrus and tropical fruit flavors.",US
1683,US,"Not much going on in this sweet Chardonnay except toothpicky oak, vanilla and watered-down peach juice.",US
1684,US,"Oily in green apple and lime, this crowd-pleasing wine is supple and smooth, with touches of honey and vanilla, especially on the finish. With a lilting ripeness at its core, it will pair well with roasted chicken in herbs.",US
1685,US,"$14 is a pretty good price for a Chardonnay that shows such ripe, succulent fruit. It's rich in oranges, pineapples, limes and mangoes, brightened with crisp acidity. Entirely unoaked, the finish is dry, pure and clean.",US
1686,US,"This is undeniably an oaky wine with a prominent layer of buttered toast and butterscotch, but the underlying orange, guava and lime flavors are pristine.",US
1687,US,"A hint of sulfur quickly gives way to aromas of Meyer lemon, mineral and yellow nectarine. Silky in texture, the wine feels lax on entrance but the acidity brightens toward the finish.",US
1688,US,"Ripe, sweet pineapple and orange jam flavors mark this rather simple, forward Chardonnay. Oak brings even sweeter vanilla, buttered toast and caramel notes. It's designed to appeal to the modern style.",US
1689,US,"Oregon Chardonnay in the low 12% alcohol range is well out of the ordinary, but it reflects the vintage conditions in 2010. This is a wine for acid lovers, with very tart green-apple fruit and a bit of spice.",US
1690,US,"Very rich and opulent. You can taste how the grapes had a long season to grow enormously ripe, delivering flavors of pineapples, pears and golden mangoes. Yet the cool vintage also preserved vital acidity. A delightful young Chardonnay for drinking now with upscale fare.",US
1691,US,"Fresh, clean and rather soft in balance, this shows easy-to-like aromas of pear and apple, slightly sweet flavors of honey and pear juice, and an almost syrupy, soft mouthfeel. It's agreeable and sweet.",US
1692,US,"From a particular block with limestone soils, this is indeed a light, steely and minerally white wine, given nine months in French oak, only 17% of it new. It takes on that oak with subtle concentration, offering a touch of baked pineapple, peach and vanilla, ending in a bittersweet bite of Meyer lemon.",US
1693,US,"A Chardonnay with sweet, simple flavors of white sugar and pineapples. Tart acidity gives it the taste of a sweet-and-sour sauce for Chinese food.",US
1694,US,"Tastes tired and flabby, with sweet oak and alcohol flavors and not much else going on.",US
1695,US,"This wine could easily be mistaken for French Chablis. It's notable for the tight, nervous feeling that acidity and minerals combine to stimulate, and the finish is very dry. There is, fortunately, a great heart of sweet tropical fruit, like the purest golden mango purée, ripe and succulent and honeyed. Terrific now, but such is the balance that this could be one of those Chardonnays that changes in interesting ways over the next 5–6 years.",US
1696,US,"This wine begins with a clean and cool nose featuring green banana and other subdued tropical notes as well as salty seaspray. Once sipped, the tropical side emerges more, with papaya and guava, as well as overripe peach. Altogether, the alcohol feels a bit high.",US
1697,US,"Crisp apple and pear flavors are touched with white floral notes on this nervy, light-footed Chardonnay. A juicy, ripe apple flavor makes it a widely appealing, easy quaffer.",US
1698,US,"The smell of tart green apple frying in butter introduces this bottling from Dan Lee's historic winery. On the palate, lemon-lime spritzer and pear flow into a saline minerality in the midpalate, with acidic tartness emerging on the finish. This is a very tight and focused Chardonnay.",US
1699,US,"Steely with lemon fruit, this wine takes some coaxing to reveal itself but is satisfyingly mouth-coating and viscous once it does, layered in citrus and a finish of honey. Balanced in acidity it'll pair well and widely with food.",US
1700,US,"This Chardonnay has plenty of ripe pineapple, pear and tropical fruit flavors. Having aged in 100% new French oak barrels, it offers rich notes of vanilla and buttered toast. Like all of Smith-Madrone's wines, this has great acidity and minerality, and even some tannins. Give this some time, and see how it is after 2017.",US
1701,US,"Sweet buttered toast, vanilla, pineapple jam and cinnamon spice flavors mark this simple little Chardonnay. It's made in the popular style that's delicious at first, and then palls.",US
1702,US,"Sweet orange soda, vanilla and buttered popcorn flavors mark this one-dimensional Chardonnay. It's fortunately brightened with crisp acidity.",US
1703,US,"This stainless-steel Chardonnay from above Malibu starts out light, tasting of grapefruit and orange, and is fairly crisp with a nice dollop of anise, but finishes too tart, almost sour as if it's been oddly acidified.",France
1704,US,"New oak stands out in this slightly sweet Chardonnay, giving a butterscotch taste to the pineapple and fig fruit. It has pleasant acidity.",US
1705,US,"Seemingly sweet and oaky, this has buttered popcorn, buttered toast and caramel cream flavors. The fruit suggests pineapples and pears.",US
1706,US,"Coming from the cool 2011 vintage, the aromas of herbs, apple and spice are light. It's medium bodied and creamy in feel with a lemony finish.",US
1707,US,"This has mild, one-dimensional scents of apple and Meyer lemon. The medium-bodied palate has fresh acidity, and shows a touch more depth than the nose with the added note of glazed white apricot.",US
1708,US,"Great acidity and minerality in this elegant young wine. Doesn't show the rich concentration of De Loach's single-vineyard Chards, but then again, it costs far less. It's actually a good value for a dry, minerally and complex Russian River Chardonnay. Don't drink it too cold.",US
1709,US,"Grown on the east side of the Salinas Valley, opposite the Santa Lucia Highlands, this Chardonnay shows excellent Monterey acidity and dryness. The pineapple, green apple and peach fruit flavors are nice and streamlined, making the wine elegant and food friendly.",US
1710,US,"It would seem like other varieties must be in the mix on this perfumed wine with its notes of apricot, grapefruit and flowers. The flavors are lighter in style with a fresh feel.",US
1711,US,"A straightforward wine, this has aromas of light spices and stone fruit. The flavors are lighter in style with the concentration a bit wanting but it still provides easy drinking pleasure.",US
1712,US,The aromas of guava and other tropical fruits are faint while the flavors seem washed out. There's enjoyment to be had but it all needs to be dialed up.,US
1713,US,"Broad aromas of seared lemons, white peach and nectarine are given nuance with a bit of quinine on this entry-level bottling. Stewed lemons and apple-custard flavors show on the plush and pillowy palate, cut with an acidic sizzle.",US
1714,US,"Richly intense, this wine wraps thick textures of caramel and toffee around tropical mango. The full body celebrates ripeness while finding enough restraint.",US
1715,US,"The trick with getting a Chardonnay this honeyed is to keep it balanced and make it finish dry. Lynmar accomplishes these tasks with dexterity. Partly because of the acidity, partly the stony, crystalline minerality. The wine is terrifically rich in tropical fruits, melons, sweet Meyer lemons and ripe summer peaches, with all the buttered toast you could ever want from oak. In lesser hands, it would all be too much.",US
1716,US,"This is a best-of-barrels blend from different vineyard sites. It's a very good wine that grabs your attention with sheer Chardonnay dazzle. The tropical fruits are incredibly ripe and intense, with sweet, smoky oak adding supportive richness, brought into focus by crisp acidity. There's a core, like the nucleus of an atom, that holds everything together. Might even age for half a dozen years.",US
1717,US,"Insanely rich and opulent, brimming with apricot and tangerine jam, green-apple butter, pineapple tart, vanilla, honeysuckle, buttered toast and spice flavors. Somehow, the mass is reined in by a tight framework of acids, minerals and oak tannins. This shows the pedigree that comes from this famous vineyard, as well as the Williams Selyem signature of extreme class and deliciousness. Drink over the next five years.",US
1718,US,"Gary Farrell is one of the few wineries to obtain fruit from this coveted vineyard. As always, the wine is intensely concentrated in tropical fruits, green apples and pears, with such weight that it can easily handle lavish new French oak. The alcohol is refreshingly low and the acidity is brisk and mouthwatering. This gorgeous evocation of Russian River Chardonnay is flashy and delicious now, but the window of opportunity seems to be between 2014–2017 before the fruit starts to fade away.",US
1719,US,"Ripe white peach and pear notes are juicy and penetrating on this bright, juicy Chardonnay, with surprising depth on the palate. It's robustly structured with a rich, full body that's cut by zesty lime acidity. It finishes moderately long.",US
1720,US,"The grapes for hail from both Carneros and Oak Knoll and have undergone both barrel and stainless steel fermentation. The result is a medium-weight to fuller-style of clean, crisp lemon and pear flavors, a swirl of tropical vanilla on the finish.",US
1721,US,"Intense in lemon and silky, it shows a touch of effervescence from the bright acidity and is textured from the time spent in barrel. The finish and lingering aftertaste steer sweet, into the land of butterscotch and caramel.",US
1722,US,"Fresh lemon, tangerine and apricot notes abound in this juicy, easy-going Chardonnay. Lack of oak aging highlights its youthful, primary character. Racy lemon acidity and zesty lemon-skin reverberate on the finish.",US
1723,US,"So sweet in pineapples and oranges despite a crisp spine of acidity, it quickly palls, making it hard to take a second sip. But lots of Chardophiles will like it.",US
1724,US,"Like a fruit juice drink, with sugary pineapple, mango and orange flavors. The acidity is bright, but this Chardonnay is more like a dessert wine than a dry table wine.",US
1725,US,"The Helix Chardonnay is a lush offering of pineapple flavor, plus a leesy, mineral-soaked midpalate that is supremely refreshing. It has terrific acidity and persistence on the palate.",US
1726,US,"Big and bold, this Chardonnay is made from fruit sourced from the winery's estate vineyard in the new Fort Ross-Seaview appellation. This underwent barrel fermentation, malolactic fermentation and lees aging, and the result is a rich selection that offers flavors of lemon and tropical fruit, buttered toast and cream. Almost too assertive now, it needs a year or two to resolve.",US
1727,US,"While this Chardonnay has rich tropical fruit and citrus flavors, with a light touch of oak, the acidity and minerality make it taste clean and balanced. Don't drink it too cold, and be sure to enjoy it with Dungeness crab and buttered sourdough bread.",US
1728,US,"This tastes a little vegetal, but it's dry, crisp and creamy, with decent orange and peach flavors.",US
1729,US,"Showing sweet toasty oak, brisk acidity and pure flavors of citrus fruit and apricot, this is a very rich, dry Chardonnay, although all of its parts haven't quite come together. While it's not an ager, it will benefit from holding until mid-2013, but not any longer.",US
1730,US,"This is a full-bodied wine that belies the notion that Oregon always makes a sleeker style of Chardonnay. Here are ripe, round flavors of peach and mango, wrapped in naturally vivid acidity, with a warming sensation in the finish. Best enjoyed soon, while fresh and young.",US
1731,US,"Cabernet specialist Venge brings its vision of big, bold wines to Chardonnay, with mixed results. The wine is huge and fruity, with massive pineapple, pear, crème brûlée, buttered toast, caramel and vanilla spice flavors, in which oak obviously plays a part. Yet it's almost too much of a good thing. It earns its high score for sheer power, but you find yourself wanting greater subtlely and finesse.",US
1732,US,"Shows the fantastic power and extracted fruit that this vineyard is famous for. Just massive in apricots, tangerines and pears, it's enriched with sweet smoky oak, which adds vanilla bean and buttered toast to the richness. Fortunately, brisk acidity and minerality provide balance.",US
1733,US,"This clean and leesy Chardonnay was fermented half in stainless, half in neutral oak. Its flavors are apple, melon and celery, with a lightly beery, textural mouthfeel that refreshes and lingers. Just a hint of toast comes up on the finish.",US
1734,US,"Baked pear and ripe tropical guava and papaya muddle their way between high-toned aspects of lemon and sheer acidity, which veers into sour territory on the finish. The dueling personalities give this wine a sense of imbalance.",US
1735,US,Aromas of pear and yellow apple are at the fore. It drinks off dry with full feel. There's enjoyment to be had but the varietal is hard to discern.,US
1736,US,"An extremely rich texture, like pear juice, and sweet flavors of ripe pear, peach and pineapple give this wine a big personality. It has no apparent crispness to balance it out and keep it lively. All that sweetness and richness suggest a good pairing with salty cheeses.",US
1737,US,"This appellation blend shows buttered toast with lemon marmalade on the nose, with a growing sense of tropicality. The palate is plush and smoky, with vanilla and cream flavors cut by just enough citrusy tang to keep it serious.",US
1738,US,"In this gold-colored wine, green-apple skin and nutmeg-ginger spice wrap around a full-bodied build, with a preponderance of ripe peach within its makeup too. Decadent, and nutty from the oak, it brings a fulsomeness of crème brûlée to the finish.",US
1739,US,"Richly intense, this wine wraps thick textures of caramel and toffee around tropical mango. The full body celebrates ripeness while finding enough restraint.",US
1740,US,"This precisely crafted wine lifts Carneros Chardonnay to a whole new level. Yes, it's pricey, but so complex and decadent, it's worth it. The alcohol is refreshingly low, the acidity is bright, and there's a lick of steel to balance the nectarine and mango fruit, buttered-toast and cream flavors.",US
1741,US,"The Chardonnays from this Farrell bottling are always very fine and among the most consistent across vintages. The 2010 shows ripe, concentrated tropical fruit and green-apple flavors, brightened with crisp, Russian River acidity. Deft, firm and delicious, it will provide great Chardonnay pleasure over the next 4–5 years.",US
1742,US,"A deeply golden Chardonnay from E & J Gallo's Edna Valley brand, this wine starts with a tightly wound nose, faintly offering tart apple, lemon rind and a slight herbal character. An elegant but brief flavor of perfumed pear washes away quickly without much finish.",US
1743,US,"Fermented and aged in stainless steel, this single-vineyard wine brings notes of yellow apple and lees accented by tart acidity. While it provides some interest, it doesn't seem like all of the pieces have quite come together.",US
1744,US,"This wine from longtime Santa Cruz Mountains producer Cinnabar offers a very subtle nose with slight, brisk minerality. Once sipped, the flavors remain subtle, though are nicely rounded with a bit of guava-based tropicalitythat emerges toward the finish.",US
1745,US,"Tastes overworked and sweetly heavy, with super-extracted pineapple jam, orange tapioca and butterscotch flavors. A heavy hand has been applied here.",US
1746,US,"This simple Chardonnay has sweet flavors of buttered popcorn, toast, orange soda and vanilla. It's made in the popular style.",US
1747,US,"Too sweet in orange, pineapple and pear juice flavors. There's a nice clean hit of acidity, but the wine is sugary all the way through.",US
1748,US,"Plenty of crisp acidity balances the citrus, tropical fruit and pear flavors in this ripe Chardonnay. There's also a strong jacket of smoky oak with its buttered toast and vanilla richness. The result will please Chard lovers at a good price.",US

1750,US,"This Chardonnay has ripe, rich tangerine, pear and pineapple flavors. It wasn't aged in oak, and the malolactic fermentation was blocked. The result is a clean, vibrant and mouthwatering selection.",US
1751,US,"This tastes bone dry, with cleansing acidity and firm minerality. It offers subtle layers of green apples, figs and tropical fruits, plus an edge of sweet vanilla.",US
1752,US,"The inclusion of 11% Aligoté, which was sourced from a block planted in 1979, makes this Chardonnay unique. The Aligoté seems to thicken the core fruit, and it adds flesh and rind-like flavor, along with old-vine details of dried herb and spice. It's a pleasing mix of integrated stone-fruit, grain and citrus-peel notes.",US
1753,US,"Clean, forward, simple apple and herb flavors combine. This is a serviceable, all-purpose Chardonnay, that finishes just a bit sour.",US

1756,US,"A good, fairly complex California Chardonnay, marked by ripe, jammy orange, pear and apricot fruit flavors. Winemaker interventions also play roles, with the malolactic fermentation adding buttery notes and French oak contributing sweet caramel.",US
1757,US,"Lots of zesty, mouthwatering acidity in this Chardonnay. The pineapple, crème brûlée, buttered toast and vanilla flavors are so rich that they require balance, which the zippy acidity provides. Maybe a touch too oaky, but that's a matter of personal preference.",US
1758,US,"Sweetly overripe with a briny backwash of green olive, this is a plain, weighty white wine that's indistinct.",France
1759,US,"One of the more reliable, big-production brands in the market right now, this wine shows fresh white flowers, with just a dollop of vanilla butter and a touch of wet stone on the nose. There is decent verve to the evenly presented and light palate, with flavors of cooked apples and sea salt.",US
1760,US,"Quite yellow in color, nearing orange, this oxidative-style wine shows quinine, walnuts and preserved lemons on the very concentrated, oily nose. The texture is sticky, with flavors of seared lemons and orange oil, yet it retains a lime-skin liveliness. It's quite an interesting bottling for fans of the style.",US
1761,US,"Ripe yellow apples and yellow pears meet with a tropical sense of guava and tuberose on this bottling from a vineyard near the intersection of Highways 101 and 154.

1762,US,"Zesty aromas of just-cut apple, lemon-lime soda and tuberose meet a stony quality on the nose of this popular wine from the Edna Valley producer. It's fresh and crisp on the palate, with ripe apples, kiwi and sea-salt flavors.",US
1763,US,"Plush, showy aromas of candied apples, caramelized pears, condensed honeysuckle, yellow peach, quinine and cinnamon spice show on the nose of this wine. The palate takes a sour turn, with lemon peels, pear skins and a touch of chamomile.",US
1764,US,"From a vineyard known for producing powerfully ripe, dense fruit with wet-stone minerality, this wine delivers on many of those points. It offers intense, rich tastes of baked apple, graham-cracker crust and crème brûlée. Soft and layered, it ends in a statement of big fruit.",US
1765,US,"Shows the estate vineyard's signature in the moderate alcohol, sleek, streamlined mouthfeel, bright acidity and intensity of flavor. It's laser-like in lime, mango, honey and vanilla, with minerally overtones that taste of the earth. Drink now, as it is very fine and delicious.",US
1766,US,"A very nice interpretation of coastal Chardonnnay, from this increasingly well-regarded vineyard. It's rich in notes of peach smoothie, pineapple tart, buttered toast, vanilla, honey and creamy lees, yet manages to finish dry. Brightened by crisp acidity, it never loses a sense of pin-pointed focus. Drink now.",US
1767,US,"Way too sweet. Tastes like they took a decent, tropical fruity Chardonnay and added a bunch of white sugar.",US
1768,US,"A lot of the fruit here comes from Lodi and that would be all well and good except the initially pleasing tropical nature of this wine, its guava and mango, full mouthfeel and texture, is wrecked by the high alcohol, which is hard to not notice, as is the wine's very sour finish.",US
1769,US,"As sweet and simple as an orange cream soda drink, although it's also oaky and the alcohol gives it body.",US
1770,US,"A wisp of smoke lends nuance to aromas of apple and white peach on this dry, refreshingly citric Chardonnay. The palate builds in bulk and body with concentrated flavors of savory apples layered in smoke and earth. Drink now.",US

1778,US,"The Sigrid never fails to deliver lush fruit and hedonistic barrel flavors. However in cooler years, when the alcohol falls below 14%, it has something extra when details of skin and flower emerge as well. This is a wine of power and finesse, with juicy pear and peach, supple acids, brioche and toasted biscuit, underscored with refreshing minerality. Drink now through 2025.",US
1779,US,"Refined, sleek and supple, this wine mixes trim fruit flavors of apple and papaya, firmly supported by medium-strength acids. There's a streak of baking spices, and a finish laden with buttered nuts, all in proportion, with nothing dominant. In short, this is a super-long, exceptional wine.",US
1780,US,"Well integrated in terms of barrel use (listed as 60% used French oak and 40% new), this features a robust exuberance of fruit, from Asian pear to Meyer lemon. Spicy with a touch of nutmeg and ginger, it hones a fine line of minerality throughout.",US

1783,US,"Everything about this Chardonnay speaks of class. It's dry and superbly structured in acids and tannins, and shows a chalky minerality that lends substance to the tropical fruit and honeysuckle flavors. Two Sisters is assembling a great track record with this bottling.",US
1784,US,"Shows the usual Williams Selyem Chardonnay profile of huge fruit and flashy oak. This opulent wine would be over-the-top except that it's balanced by crisp, lemony acidity, and somehow retains a tight core with a gravitational tug that keeps the richness focused. Impressive now for sheer power, and should hold well for another 5–6 years.",US
1785,US,"Frankly sweet, tasting like a sugared fruit juice blend of tangerines, pineapples and mangoes. Still, it's clean and streamlined in acidity.",US

1787,US,"Tastes unnatural and manipulated, with sugary sweet orange and apricot jam fruit flavors, highlighted by uncomfortably sour acidity.",US
1788,US,"So sweet. With sugary tangerine and pineapple flavors and plenty of caramel, it quickly palls.",US
1789,US,"Waxy and a touch volatile on the nose, this wine offers broad aromas of tropical fruit and barrel. The palate is lithe and medium bodied, bearing kiwi and papaya notes. It finishes with a minerally tang and vital acidity.",US

1796,US,"Deep gold and richly scented with buttered toasted-nut aromas, this 100% barrel-fermented Chardonnay is a bit old-fashioned, but deliciously delectable. Superripe fruit and decent acidity elevate it above mere oak-bomb status.",US
1797,US,"This splendid effort is sourced from the Durant Vineyard, and aged in neutral French oak for seven months prior to bottling. Spicy and dense, it's a lively blend of lime, apple, apricot and pear fruits. A trickle of juicy acidity pulls the flavors through into a finish with streaks of vanilla and clove. The 20-year-old vines provide the complexity and detail that will reward another decade of aging. Drink now through 2025.",US
1798,US,"A thrilling wine, this impresses instantly with its detail and definition. Vividly fruity with a mix of melon, apple and stone fruits, this tangy, toasty effort has nuanced notes of herb and mineral as well. Drink now through 2030.",US
1799,US,"A rich, thick and oaky 100% varietal, this comes from the Green Valley area, and possesses power and flavor in abundance. Baked apple and pear dance around lighter remembrances of lemon soufflé, finishing in a touch of ginger and nutmeg.",US
1800,US,"A light mix of apple, jicama and pear fruit, bolstered with plenty of acidity, carries this medium-weight, unoaked Chardonnay. It's perfectly pleasant, but teeters on the edge of generic flavor neutrality.",France
1801,US,"The winery held this Chardonnay back a year later than their far more expensive Journey bottling. Hard to say why, but the consumer is the beneficiary. That extra bit of aging has mellowed the wine, giving it a creamy, buttery richness. It has good acidity, too, that gives a lift to the ripe tropical fruits.",US
1802,US,"Josh Jensen brings his restrained hand to this very fine Chardonnay. It's notable for the excellence of all its parts, and the balanced way they co-exist. You'll find tantalizingly rich tropical fruit and peach flavors, with nuances of oak, as well as the minerality that the estate vineyard brings to all its wines, white and red.",US
1803,US,"Sourced from the oldest vines in the Willamette Valley, just two barrels were made of this wine. It's smooth, rich and elegant—a mix of pineapple and citrus—with light hints of coconut and toast. There's good concentration in the finish, heightened with citrus rind phenolics.",US
1804,US,"Tastes like orange juice with an extra hit of white sugar, sprinkled with cinnamon, vanilla and an oaky sweetness.",US
1805,US,"The winery turns to this Monterey appellation to up their Chardonnay games. The wine is lush and oaky, with intensely ripe tangerine and apricot flavors.",US
1806,US,"Small amounts of Riesling, Viognier, and Gewürztraminer (3% each) considerably boost the aromas giving notes of peach, dried pineapple and flowers. Coming from the cool 2011 vintage, the flavors are light in style with a lemony lick on the finish.",US
1807,US,"For a Chardonnay, the aromas of slate and petrol are a bit odd, but nonetheless idiosyncratic. Touches of white flower and wood smoke add further dimension. The palate feels glossy, and the acidity demonstrates a crescendo-like effect. It finishes bright, ending on a repeated note of smoky wood.",US
1808,US,"This is a lush, ripe wine with honey, vanilla extract, orange and lime flavors that have the caramelized sweetness of oak. Crisp acidity fortunately provides balance, on this good, straightforward Chardonnay.",US
1809,US,"There's a nice Chardonnay down underneath all the oak, but it's hard to find below the buttered toast and caramel richness. It would be nice to taste an unoaked version, to appreciate the acidity and pineapple fruit.",US
1810,US,This crisp Chardonnay has a disjointedness about it. Its aroma and flavor is most akin to Lemonheads candy.,US
1811,US,"Despite the rich, buttery, toasty oak notes, this wine stands up to the barrel influence with its strong tropical fruit and pear flavors, as well as its brisk acidity and stony minerality. It's ready to drink now with rich fare like lobsters or scallops.",US
1812,US,"This Chardonnay is dry, with vibrant acidity and tangy, mineral-infused flavors of stone and earth. It shows subtle notes of Meyer lemons, limes and tangerines. Don't drink this too cold.",US
1813,US,"This shows what extended aging can do for a vintage sparkling wine, as it gives off delicate, ripe, mellow aromas like toasted baguette, honey, toasted almonds, white tea and apple cider. The mouthfeel is elegant and smooth, while the bubbles are soft and slow. Enjoy this before or after dinner now; it's at its aging peak.",US
1814,US,"This Dijon-clone wine is well defined and complex. The mixed fruit flavors bring lime and lemon, pineapple and pear together. It's supple and long, with balanced supporting acids and a pleasing goodnight kiss of toasted marshmallows.",US
1815,US,"Decadent and intense, this smells like breakfast toast that has been slathered with red currant jam, mango butter and apricot preserves, topped with a drizzle of honey. The mouthfeel is rich, round and unctuous, with a zing of acidity that keeps it from seeming cloying. Notes of brûléed sugar and spice decorate the finish.",US
1816,US,"This stainless bottling shows fresh-squeezed lemons, yellow melon and canned pear on the fresh, clean and not overly tropical nose. The palate is smooth and plush down the middle, but sharply tight on the edges, with flavors of pear, lime and apple that prove a bit sour and tart toward the finish.",US
1817,US,"This white is a mix of tropical pineapple, tangerine and marshmallow, offering a creamy, doughy and yeasty texture on the palate. Chalky, it is medium bodied with a hint of richness, finishing more steely than stuffy.",US

1821,US,"A tremendous Chardonnay. As always, the winery's '09 is bone dry, crisply acidic and minerally. You might call it austere at this point, with its tart finish of grapefruit. But a great Hanzell Chardonnay will improve for at least a decade, possible two, and this is a great Hanzell Chardonnay. The score reflects what the wine likely will be approximately eight years down the road.",France
1822,US,"Extracted and oaky, this will appeal to those who enjoy the popular style. It's strong in buttered toast and butterscotch flavors, with a pineapple jam note.",US
1823,US,"A good Chardonnay to serve at parties, this shows plenty of oak-driven vanilla and toast flavors that ride high over the seemingly sweet note of pineapple candy. It will satisfy lots of Chardophiles, at an affordable price.",US
1824,US,"An interesting and even somewhat eccentric wine. There are notes of green tea and herbs, but enough pure orange fruit to make it rich. Lots of zingy acidity, too.",US
1825,US,"Ripe and juicy, this has flavors of tangerine and tropical fruit, plus notes of creamy lees and smoky, sweet oak. It would feel heavy if not for the brisk acidity that provides balance and elegance.",US
1826,US,"Nottingham Cellars, which is known for producing wines from Bordeaux varieties, has produced its first set of whites in 2011. This Chardonnay is earthy, and it offers a crisp lemony character and hints of nut and pear.",US

1828,US,"Always in the top rank of Oregon Chardonnays, the Sigrid expresses itself with voluptuously ripe fruits, a generous mix of apples, peaches and pears. The barrel regimen holds nothing back either, sending a tsunami of baking spices, buttered nuts and toasted biscuit flavors across and through the palate.",US
1829,US,"This wine explodes with a glorious mix of buttered nuts, toast, ripe yellow fruits and supporting acidity. The exceptional length proposes at least a decade of development ahead. Drink now through 2025.",US
1830,US,"A new effort from Long Shadows, Dance spent 15 months in French oak and shows it. Broad and smoky, it's a rich, generous, ready-to-drink wine, with just a tiny bit of unoaked 2011 wine in the blend for added lift and freshness.",France
1831,US,"This Chardonnay emphasizes structural elegance and mineral-driven acidity, rather than opulence, although you'll find good citrus and tropical fruit flavors. With a dry finish, it's a fine Chardonnay to drink with chicken, ham, salmon or pork, or a nice dish of buttery pasta with peas and Parmesan.",US

1839,US,"This is a cool-climate Chardonnay that's dark gold in color and tastes of ripe apple. From both the Ferrington and Savoy Vineyards, two of Anderson Valley's finest, it shows the greatness of the vintage in coastal Mendocino. Fragrant and rich in honey and toasty notes, it finishes crisp. Crab cakes with it would be ideal.",US
1840,US,"Neither oak aging nor malolactic fermentation was used here, hence the name. But far from madness, this wine is sleek, sensual, skillful and seductive. Crisp acidity, lemony minerality, an overriding freshness and excellent depth of flavor all combine to create a wine that seems to be more than the sum of its parts.

1848,US,"A full-bodied wine with a style that incorporates richness in the aromas and restraint in the flavors. It smells sweet and candylike, but tastes dry and oaky. A touch of walnut on the palate adds an austerity that is smoothed over on the finish with a dash of sweet oak.",US

1863,US,"This new vintage of Caitlin's Reserve was barrel-fermented in 25% new French oak. It went through regular lees stirring and a generally traditional Burgundian élévage.

1866,US,"Opulently dense, this wine opens nicely in orange blossom and caramel apple, followed by a palate that's somewhat incomplete in fruit-flavor follow-up. Concentrated and full bodied, it packs a powerful punch, ending in oak.",US
1867,US,"Ripe pineapple, orange, apricot and pear fruit joins with toasty oak to make for a pleasantly rich Chardonnay. It's a little forward, but crisp acidity provides stimulating balance.",US
1868,US,"Made from fruit sourced from McFadden's certified-organic vineyard, this bright Chardonnay is a zesty mix of kiwi, lime and fig flavors that are layered with acidity.",France
1869,US,"Seemingly sweet and simple, this has orange and butterscotch candy flavors.",US
1870,US,"Seemingly overly oaked and manipulated, this is all about buttered toast and buttered popcorn flavors, slathered over a note of pineapple jam.",US
1871,US,"This will appeal to lots of people. It's made in the popular style, bearing y ripe citrus, tropical fruit and honey flavors that are set into a creamy texture. It finishes with a touch of smoky, buttery oak.",US
1872,US,"Better known for red wines, Hendry often produces a very good Chardonnay. This 2010 shows fine acidity and sweet flavors of tropical fruit, vanilla and buttered toast.",US
1873,US,"The latest release of the H3 Chardonnay shows plenty of fruit upfront (20% was fermented in stainless steel). Firm, crisp apple and a buttery finish set this clearly in the mainstream Columbia Crest style.",US
1874,US,"Pretty on the nose with whiffs of ripe honeydew and orange blossom, this is a dry, elegantly structured Chardonnay that balances sharp, angular acidity with a rich note of sweet vanilla cream.",US

1876,US,"A stablemate to the Richard's Cuvée, bottled under the winemaker's Matello label, this is a creamy, juicy wine with a lush mix of apple, pear and banana fruit flavors. There's a suggestion of mineral underlying the creamy mouthfeel, which adds an extra bit of freshness.",France
1877,US,"This wine is tight and citrusy now, with a kick of acidity. It's elegantly structured, but not showing much generosity, despite a core of lemondrop candy, green apple and honeysuckle flavors. Give it a few years to develop.",US
1878,US,"This has the look and feel of a fine white Burgundy, with expressive acidity, pinpointed oak, rich creaminess and a certain stony minerality. Yet the fruit is pure California, tropical and succulent. The wine is from the Pisoni family.",US
1879,US,"Pleasant and fruity to sip, soft in texture, light- to medium bodied, it has a rich yellow-gold color, butter-candy aromas, ripe apple flavors and a slightly sweet finish.",US
1880,US,"Concentrated in pleasing pear and stone fruit, the toasty oak and oily richness of this wine detracts from the fruit. It comes into its own with some air, the texture showing more acidity and balance.",US
1881,US,"The reason why this winery scores so well, year after year, in Chardonnay is because the production team knows how to get maximum ripeness out of the grapes, while maintaining an integrity of structure. The '09 Hyde exhibits this quality. It's fantastically rich in oranges, apricots, pears and pineapples, yet possesses a bracing minerality and fine Carneros acidity.",US
1882,US,"Very little of this bottling was made. It's an experiment in making a white wine the way one would a red, fermented with skins and seeds, then aged eight months in new French oak. It's not for everyone. Cloudy and funky, it's teeming with acidity and yet somewhat dense on the palate, the fruit muted in favor of a taste of flowers and clay.",US
1883,US,"Light green-apple fruit and gentle highlights of cinnamon are in place, though this wine feels a little flat on the palate. A quick finish brings a hint of plastic.",US
1884,US,"Sharply etched in pineapple and Meyer lemon, this wine retains a brightness of fruit and acidity throughout, never overly impeded by oak. A subtle, earthy herbal streak plays in the background.",US

1886,US,"As delicate as water, with faint hints of citrus fruits and buttered toast.",US

1892,US,"Very light in color, this bubbly shows ripe apples, caramelized pears, nectarine flesh, yellow cake and the slightest hint of roasted nuts, marzipan and yeast on the dynamic nose.

1893,US,"This wine from one of the appellation's most coveted producers smells fresh, with white flowers, slightly sweet white peach, lemon rinds and brie cheese rind. It's laser-focused on the tart, somewhat bitter palate, and slowly unfurls into flavors of pomelo juice and lime pith, warming up toward cream the longer it is opened. This has a long life in front of it, so drink 2018–2025.",US
1894,US,"The winery's various Chardonnays are defined by their varying clonal mixes. Here the blend delivers polished flavors of lemon-lime, orange peel and apple butter. There's a hint of bourbon barrel also, from aging in mostly neutral French oak. This young wine is round, full bodied and spicy, ready for immediate enjoyment.",US
1895,US,"Smoke and toast dominate the nose of this barrel-fermented Chardonnay, and overpower subtle apple and pear flavors on the palate. It's a bit earthy and savory in style, but bright with citrus acidity.",US
1896,US,"While relatively neutral on the nose with notes of savory apple and pear, the palate is deeply earthy with flavors of mushroom and dried herb. Light in body and alcohol, it's brisk on the palate with a streak of lemon-lime acidity.",US
1897,US,"A barrel fermented Chardonnay that is uncharacteristically soft and fruity. Aromas of bananas and bubble gum lead to slightly sweet, uncomplicated flavors. The texture and body are light.",US
1898,US,"Coconut-laden oak kicks off the entry of this wine, a crisp version of the variety that nonetheless exhibits plenty of oak characteristics and a rich ripeness of baked apple, pear and pineapple.",US
1899,US,"Floral and inviting in vanilla and caramel, this wine tastes bigger and richer than it is, offering more in the way of ripeness and texture than acidity. It finishes full bodied.",US
1900,US,"Made from Celilo Vineyard fruit, this has a sharp-toned bite to its aromas and flavors. Hints of tropical fruits can be found, but the core of the wine is citrusy. A suggestion of light caramel surfaces on the finish.",US
1901,US,"The new Mercer Canyons label gets off to a good start with this Chardonnay that's low in alcohol and clean. Bracing and leesy, this is definitely European in style, and it offers celery and melon flavors along with palate-refreshing minerality.",US
1902,US,"This has a rich note of caramel, plus undertones of baked apple and tropical fruit. The acidity is keen and the finish is long, with vanilla and butter notes. It's aged in 40% new French oak, and it has the roundness to show for it.",US
1903,US,"New oak dominates this Chardonnay, along with brisk acidity. Beneath the buttered toast and butterscotch are intensely concentrated tropical fruit flavors. The wine is a little linear now, possibly because the vines are quite young. Give it 2–3 years in the cellar.",US
1904,US,"With  this bottling, Kenneth Volk has produced the quintessential cool-climate, unoaked Chardonnay. The grape  variety reveals itself strongly, with classic peach and tropical fruit flavors that are very ripe, almost apricoty. The Santa Maria Valley's chilly climate shows up in brisk, mouthwatering acidity, while the finish is thoroughly dry. Additional richness was provided by sur-lie aging, which brings creamy notes.",US
1905,US,"Overoaked and tired, a simple, sweet Chardonnay with buttered popcorn and pineapple jam flavors.",US
1906,US,"Brilliant acidity, dryness and tangy minerality mark this Chardonnay. The grapes come from the estate vineyard in the cool, southern part of the valley. Shows tangy, steel-tinged flavors of pineapples, oranges and honeysuckle, with an extraordinary richness that finishes dry.",US

1910,US,"There's little if any oak on this Chardonnay, which allows brisk Central Coast acidity and bright, long hangtime fruit to star. And that fruit is rich, suggesting tangerines, nectarines, Meyer lemons and Asian pears. Very nice with crab risotto, or with a beautiful roasted chicken.",US
1911,US,"This is a terrific Chardonnay, dry, crisp and minerally, with tantalizing citrus, pear and tropical fruit flavors. The winery says it's from the Russian River Valley, which makes the official North Coast labeling bizarre. But it's a very fine, upscale wine.",US
1912,US,"Simple and sweet, a New World Chardonnay with pineapple, orange cream and vanilla flavors. Crisp acidity provides fortunate cover for the richness.",US
1913,US,"Whole cluster-pressed, then settled and racked to barrels, this is a garden of sensual delights.

The seamless, seemingly endless finish brings in a finishing swish of buttery toast.",US
1914,US,"Exceptionally fragrant, it sends up scents of white peaches and hazelnuts. Savory highlights adorn the crisp, detailed fruit flavors of peach, pear and yellow apples.",US
1915,US,"Soft, creamy and buttery, this will surely please those who like a banana cream pie style of Chardonnay. There's peaches in there too, and papaya—a lot of ripe fruit, nicely matched to the oak flavors. Drink now.",US
1916,US,"Winemaker Morten Hallgren harnesses a traditional Italian grape-drying technique called appassimento to create this richly concentrated but dry Chardonnay. Initial notes of smoke and roasted hazelnut skins fade on the nose and palate to reveal a clean, fresh apple and pear character, speckled with white flowers and a bright lemon-lime acidity.",US
1917,US,"This is a complex Chardonnay, with flavors of honey, tangerine, apricot and toffee that are balanced by the crisp, citrusy acidity.",US
1918,US,"This has brisk, tingly acidity and rich, toasty new oak flavors, plus mineral and fruit notes. Try this in 2015 as it could become surprisingly complex.",US
1919,US,"Canned pears and plumeria show on the nose of this bargain-priced offering, worthy of a weeknight dinner or later in the evening. The palate shows lots of ripe stone fruit, apple syrup and tangy citrus, the finish delivering a lasting acidity.",US
1920,US,"The nose of this widely available wine jumps from condensed apples and honey to cut pear on the more broad whiffs. The flavors are light and a tad ripe, with red apples, citrus and orange juice flavors.",US
1921,US,"This is an intense, somewhat unformed vineyard-designate, ripe with sweet tannins that takes on considerable barrel flavors of vanilla and caramel.",US
1922,US,"Another fine Chardonnay from this producer. It's typical of the vineyard, showing intensely concentrated tropical and citrus fruit and green apple flavors, enhanced with mouthwatering acidity. Vertical tastings of this bottling show its ability to slowly evolve in the bottle over as much as eight years.",US
1923,US,"A gigantic Chardonnay. What it lacks in subtlety it more than makes up for in sheer power. Dazzles with pineapple jam, mango, pear, lime, buttered toast and sweet oak flavors, balanced with fine acidity. There's a minerally stoniness that makes it even more complex. Drink now–2014.",US
1924,US,"Fat, oily, unctuous and honeyed. Shows massive pineapple, mango, tangerine and Asian pear fruit, with a savory spiciness and plenty of sweet, smoky oak. As ripe as it is, it's saved from simplicity by brilliant acidity, a mineral cleanliness, and a thoroughly dry finish.",US
1925,US,"Superrich in pineapple, lime, kiwi and tropical fruit flavors, this lovely Chardonnay has a rich, balanced overlay of sweet, smoky oak. A blend of Lynmar's various vineyards, the wine's brisk acidity and minerality shine through, making the richness bright and clean. A brilliant Chardonnay to drink now.",US
1926,US,"A beautiful Chardonnay, rich and ripe in fruit, yet balanced with dryness and racy acidity and a fine minerality. The pineapple and orange flavors are accented with sweet, smoky oak. Drink this luxuriously elegant wine now.",US
1927,US,"Underlying the tart fruit flavors of crisp apple and cucumber are spicy, peppery highlights. At the moment, the new oak barrel flavors often found are not evident, but wines go through interesting morphs along the aging curve. This one is just starting to soften up. Organically grown and limited to just 107 cases.",US
1928,US,"This has the sort of tart, lemon custard flavor you might find in a French pastry. It's snappy and fresh, the fruit amplified with toasty oak scents and accents. Still young and raw, it will profit from decanting and/or a couple more years in bottle.",US
1929,US,"From Dijon clones, this sculpted, tight, compact Chardonnay feels as if it is shut in a cocoon. Give it time (and decanting) to unwrap, and it shows elegant tropical and stone fruits, caramel, vanilla cream and butter flavors, backed with moderate acids.",US
1930,US,"Smooth and fruity, this shows the banana/tropical side of the grape, enlivened by some brighter Washington acidity. It's creamy and carries a streak of vanilla into the finish.",US

1933,US,"Greg La Follette shows his mastery with this Chardonnay from cool Manchester Ridge. Dark gold in color, this ethereal wine is punctuated by pretty floral and citrus tones on the nose. On the palate, expect a suggestive core of lemon, guava and lingering minerality, especially through a finish that's flush with acidity.",US
1934,US,"Elevates the Keller style of superripe, oaky Chardonnay into a more refined, balanced wine, equally rich but more perfect. It's still potent in buttered toast, vanilla, caramel, honey and pineapple jam, but crisp acidity and minerality help to give structure to the opulence.",US
1935,US,"Nectarine flesh and a hint of guava combine for a rather tropical-leaning nose on this wine from the famed Hollywood director's collection. A straightforward and very ripe Gala apple character characterizes the palate, boosted by honeysuckle and tangerine, laid across a decently grippy texture.",US
1936,US,"Tasted in early spring, this Chard was still tingly with acidity, but by the time you read this, everything should have calmed down. It's terrifically ripe with green apple, nectarine and tropical fruit flavors that are so rich, you won't even miss the oak.",US
1937,US,"Failla reaches into this new appellation within Napa Valley for this vineyard-designated Chard. It's a little heavier and softer than the Chardonnays from Sonoma County usually associated with the winery. Very rich in tropical fruits and pears, while the oak is lavish in vanilla and buttered toast. Drink now.",US
1938,US,"True to the Pride style, this Chardonnay is massively constructed, with an enormous blast of pineapple, orange and golden mango fruit, elaborated with sweet, smoky, caramelized oak. It's saved from being a mere fruit bomb by crisp acidity and a bracing minerality. Drink now for sheer hedonistic freshness.",US
1939,US,"Lots of richness in this Chardonnay, in the form of pineapples, pears, peaches, nectarines and golden mangoes. But you'll also find a firm minerality that grounds it, and supportive acidity, like a squirt of lime. Oak adds the final touch of vanilla and caramel.",US
1940,US,"Not very Chardonnay-like, more like a Viognier or Pinot Gris with its aromatic floral, tropical fruit, citrus, melon and spice aromas and flavors. Still, it's very tasty, and dry as well, with a crisp spine of minerally acidity.",US
1941,US,"Firm and fresh, this puts pear and apple fruit front and center. There are some skin flavors also, lending a bit of phenolic bite to the finish.",US
1942,US,"Finished with a little oak, this Chardonnay features buttered toast and vanilla flavors on top of the pineapple, tropical fruit and sweet honey notes. It's a nice, stylishly rich wine to drink now.",US
1943,US,"This is a good wine to drink if you want a modestly elegant Chardonnay to serve alongside food, instead of a big, oaky sweetie. It's dry and crisp and clean, with pleasantly rich flavors of citrus fruits, peaches, green apples, minerals and vanilla. Easy to find, with 17,000 cases produced.",US
1944,US,"There's a lightly spritzy tickle in the mouth, and a metallic undertaste to this Chardonnay. The blend includes 5% each Pinot Gris and Sauvignon Blanc, all done in stainless steel. Thin and a bit green, it does not quite come together.",US
1945,US,"A sweet, simple Chardonnay, with pineapple and orange jam flavors and oak-like vanilla and caramel influences.",US

1948,US,"They packed a lot of flavor into this rich Chardonnay for the price. It's toasty buttery and popcorny from winemaker treatment, with ripe fruit notes of pineapples and exotic tropical fruits. A brisk streak of minerals and acidity provides clean balance.",US
1949,US,"The winery calls this brand new bottling a declassification of the estate Chardonnay, by barrel elimination. It's not quite as dramatic as their '09 estate, but, at half the price, it's a great buy. Dry, crisp and minerally, with citrus, pear and tropical fruit flavors, it's an elegant, Chablis-style Chard to drink now.",US
1950,US,"Hints of red berry, blossom and grapefruit are beguiling in this bright, fresh Chardonnay. Dry and surprisingly full bodied, the palate is juicy, with fresh pear and quince flavors that are brightened by a splash of lime-tinged acidity.",US

1953,US,"Strongly oaky at first sniff, this barrel-fermented reserve went through complete malolactic fermentation and a year and a half of barrel aging. The complexity comes out as it breathes open, a mélange of nuanced fruit including guava, peach, pineapple and green apple. Skin phenolics (from whole-cluster pressing) add some bite to the lengthy finish.",US
1954,US,"A rich, crisp Chardonnay whose acidity provides welcome balance to the elaborate flavors. They include pineapples, tropical fruits and spices. The creamy texture lends a comforting warmth. Now–2013.",US
1955,US,"An elegant Chardonnay, brisk in acidity, with a firm minerality, like a lick of steel. It's very dry, but seems almost sweet, with a wealth of lime, pineapple, peach and green apple fruit that's perfectly ripe. Drink this flashy young wine now.",US
1956,US,"With appealing pineapple, orange, pear and green apple flavors enhanced with the vanilla and buttered toast of oak, this is a delicious Chardonnay. Its bright acidity makes it clean and mouthwatering. It's as good as the winery's more expensive Chards, making it a relative bargain. Production was 4,200 cases.",US

1958,US,"Way too sugary sweet and simple, with orange and apricot jam flavors.",US
1959,US,"This is a good, dry Chardonnay, marked by brisk acidity and a steely minerality. The fruit veers toward pineapples and apricots, while oak adds notes of buttered toast and caramel. Feels like it wants to be richer than it is, but it's elegant.",US
1960,US,"Fruity and spritzy, this fragrant, screwcapped Chardonnay is scented with apples, pears, a hint of grapefruit and spice. It's front-loaded, nicely balanced at 13% alcohol, and best enjoyed lightly chilled.",US
1961,US,"This unusual Chardonnay is fermented and aged sur lie in 60 gallon stainless-steel barrels. The pleasant mix of fruit includes cucumber, melon, jicama and apple, balanced and tart. The color, already a fairly deep gold, suggests that you drink it soon.",France

1971,US,"Very limited, this is a relatively new project from second generation winemaker Jason Lett.

1972,US,"An elegant, compelling Chardonnay, its fruit accented with lemon, honey and lime. Low cropping of Dijon clone 76 has concentrated the flavors (and the alcohol—a surprising 15.7%) without turning the wine into an overblown fat boy. Nuanced and long, it is one of the most satisfying Chardonnays to come out of Oregon in recent memory.",US

1976,US,"This wine hails from an estate that dates back to 1978, but was more recently purchased by San Luis Obispo developer Rob Rossi and Raytheon CEO Bill Swanson.

The wine boasts a lifting nose of cream, hazelnut and baked apples, then dances across the palate with lemon-zest and flint flavors.",US
1977,US,"A great Rincon Chardonnay, Talley's best ever. So rich and dramatically layered in pineapple tart, Meyer lemon custard, Key lime pie, golden apricot, mango and vanilla oak flavors, yet so briskly acidic and bright, with a firm minerality, like a lick of cold steel.

It's smoothly textured, and the acidity provides good balance to the fleshy finish.",US
1994,US,"Vanilla soda, pineapple and a touch of herbaceousness hit the nose first in this Chardonnay, which is grown high in the Santa Lucia range by a family that's ranched the land since the 1850s.

1999,US,"The label includes the words “Original Vines” written along the side, a nod to the history of this limited reserve, gleaned from vines planted by founder David Lett in 1965. It's steely and sharp edged, with sculpted fruit and limited use of new oak. Cellarworthy and distinctive, this wine rewards your attention and patience with unexpected layers of detail.",US
2000,US,"Chardonnays from this vineyard are virtually guaranteed to be among the richest in California, and Talley's 2008 certainly doesn't disappoint. It's a massively structured, flamboyant wine, tremendous in tropical fruit, pear, peach and apple flavors that taste like they've been baked into a pie, along with the sweet, smoky crust. A tremendous wine that must be paired with equally sized food. Lobster and scallops come to mind, served in rich cream and butter sauces.",US
2001,US,"A nice counterpoint to Wagner's oaked Reserve Chardonnay, this version is juicy and bright, offering pristine apple and lemon flavors. Concentrated and lush on the palate, it's balanced by a shower of lemon-lime-like acidity and crushed-stone minerality.",US
2002,US,"The malolactic fermentation on this unoaked wine was blocked, so this is brimming with pure orange and lime flavors. The acidity is brisk and clean.",US
2003,US,"Winemaker Greg Morthole plays all the bells and whistles on this Burgundian-style Chardonnay. Barrel fermentation brings toast and sweet vanilla to the tropical fruit and green apple flavors, while the full malolactic fermentation adds notes of buttered popcorn. The acidity is racy and clean.",US
2004,US,"Made in a more popular style than Calera's Mt. Harlan bottling, this Chard features lush flavors of pineapple and orange jam, honey and vanilla. The acidity is bright and mouthwatering.",US
2005,US,"Light flavors of butterscotch and toast are wrapped into a broad, palate-coating wine with ripe yellow fruits. It's fresh and lively, and drinking especially well in its youth.",US
2006,US,"This is a good, sound, everyday Chardonnay. It's very dry and crisp in Central Coast acidity, with mineral-laded flavors of lemons, limes, apples and pineapples, touched with vanilla and buttered toast.",US
2007,US,"A deep straw, this unusual Chardonnay has a strong herbal component, with penetrating seed and grass flavors wrapped around tart, green apple fruit. It's a little oxidized, drinking well, but not for cellaring.",US
2008,US,"Shows the racy acidity and brilliantly ripe flavors of the winery's finest Chardonnays. The pineapple, mango, pear, lime and green-apple fruit purity is massive and impressive. There's a sweet vanilla note that must come from the grapes, as no oak ever touched this lovely wine.",US
2009,US,"Superrich, offering waves of pineapple, mango, buttered toast and vanilla flavors. The brilliantly crisp acidity of Edna Valley makes it all clean and brisk. Not much going on below the appealing surface, so drink now. Ahi tuna tartare comes to mind.",US
2010,US,"Lots of richness for the price in this Chardonnay. Shows pineapple custard, lemon meringue pie, vanilla cream and caramel flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Easy to find, with 9,000 cases produced.",US
2011,US,"Taking off with a bright tangerine and lime nose, the citrus carries through to the palate, where grapefruit flavors take the varietal into curious yet compelling places. Acidity is at the forefront, thanks to the all-stainless-steel processing, but it feels strategically integrated.",France
2012,US,"A pleasant, easy to drink Chardonnay whose price makes it a special value. It's dry and crisp, with tangerine and lemonade flavors finished with a touch of buttered toast and vanilla.",US
2013,US,"This everyday Chardonnay will appeal to fans of the modern style of ripe fruit and plenty of oak. It's rich and creamy, with pineapple, tangerine and mango flavors.",US
2014,US,"This tastes like a fruit juice blend of pineapples, oranges, mangoes and apricots. The acidity makes it taste bright and crisp.",US
2015,US,"Rich and oaky, this Chardonnay is pretty much as good as Mercy's more expensive single-vineyard bottlings. It feels creamy and smooth, and it tastes of luscious peach and vanilla custard, butterscotch and toast. Brisk acidity enlivens the palate.",US
2016,US,"This is a smooth, easy-drinking Chardonnay, and it offers light tropical flavors of banana and melon. There's a scent and underlying flavor of cracker and toast, which has not yet integrated with the fruit, but it may improve with further bottle age.",US
2017,US,"This bottling is showing its age, with the fruit character picking up a hazelnut, brown butter, honey and mushroom character. A very interesting wine, and worth the price to see how a proper Chardonnay ages. Drink over the next year or two before it falls apart.",US
2018,US,"This fine-honed Chardonnay hews to the Eyrie house style. It may seem austere at first, but the green and yellow fruit flavors are ripe, not vegetal, and the firm acidity makes it a fine food match. Give it plenty of time to breathe before serving.",France
2019,US,"This is a dry, firmly crisp Chardonnay, with pineapple, apricot, mineral and vanilla flavors. It's somewhat simple and direct, but very clean and zesty. Nice for drinking now.",US
2020,US,"The winery mentions neutral oak barrels, though the immediate aromatic impression is still on the toasty/oaky side. The fruit comes up more slowly, along with residual CO2 that gives a spritzy mouthfeel. Yeasty, light and tart, with green apples the strongest fruit flavor.",US
2021,US,"A light, cool vintage yields a fine and refined effort, offering a pretty mix of citrus, apple and melon fruit. It's underscored with balanced, lemony acids and a touch of minerality.",France
2022,US,"This is a terrific Chardonay, one of the best from Napa Valley, and it happens to be from the cooler Coombsville area. It's dry and crisp in acidity, which nicely balances the flamboyantly oaked peach, green apple and herb flavors that are beautifully wrapped into a buttery, creamy texture.",US
2023,US,"A worthy followup to the dramatic '08. Bone dry and zesty in cool-climate acidity, it shows bracing flavors of steely minerals, Meyer lemons, limes and buttered toast. A terrifically complex, Chablis-style wine made for upscale fare, and should develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",US
2024,US,"Dry, acidic and a little earthy, this shows elegance and restraint. With a medium level of alcohol and subtle citrus and mineral flavors, this wine is ready to drink now with roasted chicken or grilled salmon.",US
2025,US,"This curious Chardonnay transforms rather dramatically in the glass. It's initially savory, with notes of dried herbs and leaves, but gradually it reveals touches of fresh lemon, apple and vanilla, accompanied by dashes of dusty minerals that linger on the finish. Full bodied and dry.",US
2026,US,"On the soft and buttery side, this Chardonnay doesn't hold back on the popcorn aroma. Once past that, you'll find a pretty flavor that tastes like a piece of spiced, fresh-baked apple pie.",US
2027,US,"Ripe orange, lime and honey flavors combine with tingly, mouth-watering acidity to give this dry Chardonnay a sweet-and-sour taste. It's an easy wine to drink with mushroom risotto, garlic shrimp, chicken fajitas.",US

2029,US,"A high-acid, weighty and complex white, this vintage is even better than the last, gorgeous in a golden tannish color. Tropical guava and white flowers weave seamlessly through a web of minerality and freshness, without compromising body and texture. This is a delicious wine.",US
2030,US,"This reserve-level wine is sublime in stone fruit and lime as well as pear. The oak used for aging this wine was all neutral, and the taste and impact of it is unobtrusive. While vibrant in fruit, it also offers richer hints of caramel and graham cracker in complex and balanced ways, ending with persistence.",US
2031,US,"Lynmar has released this, the first of their 2012 Chardonnays, early, in order to let the fruit star. It's flashy, like a conga line of pineapples, oranges, mangoes, limes and papayas. Tasty, direct and appealing, it would be amazing with bacon-wrapped shrimp.",US
2032,US,"Attractive for its rich creaminess, this Chard aims for the popular style and succeeds. It's soft and rich in orange, peach, apricot and mango fruit, with sweet-oak overtones of vanilla and buttered toast.",US
2033,US,"This is sort of a junior version of Talbott's more expensive Sleepy Hollow Chardonnay. It resembles it in many ways, offering concentrated tropical and citrus fruit flavors, highlighted by brisk acidity and wrapped into a creamy texture.",US
2034,US,"A full, fruity, slightly hot Chardonnay. The barrel aging—all French, 60% new—brings the expected toastiness. This is a solidly made, fruit-forward style, immediately ready for drinking.",US
2035,US,"There's some barrel influence in this Chardonnay, but the oak is way in the background. What stars is Edna Valley fruit, pure and refined and textbook varietal. Pineapples, tangerines, Meyer lemons, limes, kiwis, you get the idea— clean, acidic, mouthwatering citrus fruits—brilliantly crisp and tangy. Drink right away for maximum freshness.",US
2036,US,"Adelsheim helped to pioneer Dijon clone Chardonnay in Oregon, a movement that completely reshaped and reinvigorated those wines. Crisp styling (from stainless steel fermentation and no malolactic) puts the emphasis on clean, refreshing fruit flavors of melon, star fruit, lime and cucumber, with excellent concentration and length.",US
2037,US,"This statewide blend stands up well against far more expensive Chardonnays. It's rich and crisp in acidity, with tropical fruit, pear and peach flavors, as well as a generous coating of oak and buttercream. Easy to find, with nearly 11,000 cases produced.",US
2038,US,"Though lightly ripened, with alcohol at 13.5% and flavors keeping to the yellow-green fruit spectrum, the use of oak barrels for both fermentation and aging adds pleasing layers of butter and caramel. It's a French style, with a welcoming elegance.",US
2039,US,"Strong scents of oak and butter come rushing out of the glass, with a medicinal edge. Though it has had some bottle age, this wine has not yet knit together. The ripe, soft, banana-flavored fruit and the forceful oak components are distinct and separate. Try it with pasta or poultry in a rich cream sauce that can pull everything together.",US
2040,US,"Made in a tart, citrusy style, like an elegant Chablis, this rich, balanced Chardonnay shows candied flavors of pineapples, lemon custard, Key lime pie and stony minerals. Brisk acidity provides a keen, bracing balance.",US
2041,US,"This is one of those wines that could be anything from Chardonnay to Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon Blanc. It doesn't really matter, because it's pleasant and easy to drink, with sweet flavors of tangerines and vanilla.",US
2042,US,"This is a flavorful, slightly heavy-feeling Chardonnay that offers ripe flavors of apricots, tropical fruits and pineapple cream. Although it's dry, it has a honeyed accent, especially on the spicy finish.",US
2043,US,"Pretty floral notes mingle enticingly with smoke and nut aromas in this vanilla-kissed Chardonnay. It's rich and creamy on the palate, with concentrated apple flavors and bright, lemony acids that add vibrancy to the finish.",US
2044,US,"The subtle scent of vanilla soufflé translates as a soft mouthfeel and buttered toast flavors, resulting in a wine ready for meals both casual (roast chicken and mashed potatoes) or upscale (nut-crusted halibut atop polenta). There's ample acidity, but it still falls in the traditional California Chardonnay camp.",US
2045,US,"Pretty yet substantial, the winery has sourced good fruit and worked magic in this bottling. It's generous in toasty oak and creamy in texture. A mellow minerality unfolds on the finish.",US
2046,US,"In this lively, delicately balanced wine from an exceptional vineyard, an exuberance of pear and tangerine plays on the palate, buoyed by focused minerality. With just the right touch of ripeness and richness, it ends with a suggestion of lemon custard.",US
2047,US,"This is a tremendous blend of various vineyard sites, coaxed together into a stunning combination of beautiful floral aromas, ginger and baked lemon. Given time in half new oak, it takes on flavors of apple and vanilla, never venturing out of range and remaining balanced and textured.",US
2048,US,"This is one of Lynmar's most expensive Chardonnays, of their six 2011s. It's also one of the most forward and oakiest. Your first impression is of sweet buttered toast, sprinkled with brown sugar and drizzled with melted butterscotch. Then the tropical fruits kick in, brightened with citrusy acids. It's an impressive feat, but the wine feels overworked, and lacks the sustaining interest of Lynmar's other bottlings.",US
2049,US,"Lean, dry and minerally, with tart flavors of grapefruit, lemon peel and Asian pear. The acidity is refreshingly crisp. This is a bottling that rarely does well in blind tastings because it's so austere. But it is elegant.",France
2050,US,"A superb wine to taste if you want to understand why Iron Horse Chardonnays are so good. With no oak, it stars pure pineapple, orange, green apple, lime and tropical fruit flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Just delicious.",US
2051,US,"The oak presently stands out, giving a blast of buttered toast, drizzled with honey. But the wine is very crisp in acidity and balanced and ripe in pineapples, pears and green apples. Could be an interesting bottle to cellar for four or five years.",US
2052,US,"Lots of zesty acidity and minerals in this Chardonnay, but also lots of richness. Brims with ripe pineapples, peaches, papayas and green apples, with extra levels of buttered toast and honey. A crowd-pleasing wine to drink now.",US
2053,US,"Sweet and oaky, this Chard tastes like a vanilla and caramel cream soda, with alcohol and a squirt of pineapple essence. Defines the superripe, opulent style, without much complexity.",US
2054,US,"Horse & Plow continues to make nice wines from organic grapes. This vintage shows a subtle lemon streak with a tiny smidge of tropical guava and is all-around balanced, steely and meaty at the same time without overdone oak. Golden honey and lemon finish things off.",US
2055,US,"Occasio, which has made a nice Fume Blanc for a couple of vintages now, is giving the world this, its first Chardonnay, a true to its French-oak-fermented style that's quite citrus-laden, tart, lean and mean and yet voluptuous, with its barrel age showing, and toasty on the finish.",US
2056,US,"Lots of oak on this Chardonnay, which is dominated by toothpicky vanilla and buttered toast aromas and flavors. Underneath is a fine, crisp wine, with tangerine and sweet Meyer lemon flavors.",US
2057,US,"A trail of smoke wafts from start to finish on this dry, medium-bodied Chardonnay from Fox Run. Refreshing and lean on the palate with an abundance of fresh apple flavors, it's bright and clean with a lemony acidity that shines.",US
2058,US,"This bears apple and pear flavors that are set amidst buttery, toasty accents. It's smooth and easy to drink, and the mouthfeel has a certain oiliness.",US
2059,US,"Sourced from a 35-year-old vineyard with views of the San Francisco Bay, this wine offers aromas of toasted oak, marshmallow, green pear and wet rock. The wood is quickly wiped out by brisk acidity on the palate, but then emerges again on the creamy finish. Given the acid levels in this cool vintage, this wine will evolve through at least 2019, but it's fine now.",US
2060,US,"A winner from a consistently excellent winery. A distinctive tropical fruit aroma leads to lively apple and lemon flavors. It's balanced, complex, and lingering on the finish. Try with soft cheeses or shellfish.",US
2061,US,"A whisper of a wine made from Chardonnay grapes as a pétillant naturel, or pet-nat, this third vintage of Lily's Cuvée should prove as enormously popular as the prior two, dry, delicious and unbearably light. No sugar or yeast are added and the grapes are whole-cluster pressed. There's no better wine for midday picnics or hikes in the woods.",France
2062,US,"This is solidly made, with forward and ripe fruit flavors of peach, pear and apple. A gentle touch with spices—cinnamon and baking spices—adds extra interest to the wine as it plays across the palate.",US
2063,US,"A unique nose of chives, dill and more fresh-cut herbs mixes with wet river stones and tangerine peel on this wine from a Napa-based producer. The energetic palate starts with pencil lead before diving into washes of lemon-lime citrus and settling on a cashew-nut frame, presented with tremendous length and depth.",US
2064,US,"This wine from the Franscioni family's home vineyard shows tight aromas of lime candy, chalky rock, Pink Lady apple, sliced mandarin orange and a hint of honeysuckle. The palate is full of energy, with a wide range of orange flavors, from Pixie tangerines to Creamsicles, with a touch of honey on the finish.",US
2065,US,"Aged for a year in stainless-steel barrels, this wine is a combination of two vineyard blocks. The area planted to Old Wente 5 clone contributes zesty acidity and crisp apple; the V9 vineyard block is known for minerality. Acidity is balanced and the bouquet quite floral, with the palate devoted to brioche and golden honey.",US
2066,US,"A great value from Wente, this is a layered, bright and intensely lemon-tinged Chardonnay, worth stocking up for simple dinners and get togethers where you know a lot of people will want to drink white.",US
2067,US,"Very ripe and fruity, offering wave after wave of pineapple, orange, mango, peach, green apple and vanilla. Tastes honeyed and ripe in fruity essence, but fundamentally this is a dry wine. Brilliant acidity helps to provide a clean balance.",US
2068,US,"This sugary-sweet dessert Chardonnay tries hard to please, offering waves of honey, tangerine, mango and vanilla flavors. It's tantalizingly delicious, but could be just a tad more concentrated, especially at this price.",US
2069,US,"Rich and dramatic, if a little overworked. It's superripe in pineapple and orange jam fruit, with a strong application of sweet oak that layers vanilla and buttered toast. Brings Chardonnay to its ultimate deliciousness, but would benefit from greater nuance. Drink now.",US
2070,US,"A lightly tawny straw color, this is scented with grass and hay and smoked meat—unusual for a Chardonnay. Light apple-flavored fruit carries that same, strong smoked meat (and slightly plastic) streak of flavor—unmissable and quite persistent.",US
2071,US,"A solid, direct Chardonnay. Doesn't offer a whole lot of complexity, but it's dry and creamy, with spicy, oak-inspired pineapple and green apple flavors.",US
2072,US,"Pretty severe, an acidic, raspingly dry wine and even a tannic one. Shows an astringency rare in Chardonnay, even though there are some good pineapple and buttered toast flavors. Not an ager.",US
2073,US,"Released at the age of nearly four years, this wine tastes a little sweet and tired, like melted apricot jam sprinkled with vanilla and cinnamon, with dried fruit and herbal notes. Drink now before it goes further downhill.",US
2074,US,"Here's a good, everyday Chardonnay that will satisfy fans of the variety who want a hit of oak. It's smooth in pineapples and peaches, with layers of buttered toast and cream.",US
2075,US,"Lemon zest and wildflower notes lend a delicate feel to this fresh, steely, unoaked Chardonnay. It's a minerally wine, with notes of saline and crushed oyster shells, and a brisk finish.",US
2076,US,"Rich and oaky, this wine's buttered toast and buttered popcorn flavors are the main attraction. You'll also find a pineapple-orange jam note, plus a vanilla-like sweetness.",US
2077,US,"The brisk acidity on this wine balances the seemingly sweet flavors of pineapple-orange jam, vanilla bean and buttered toast. This is an affordable introduction to the fine Chardonnays from this well-regarded Santa Barbara County appellation.",US
2078,US,"Smells and tastes too oaky, with buttered toast and vanilla notes smothering everything else. Somewhere down in there is a pretty nice Chardonnay, with good acidity and fine pineapple, pear and apple flavors.",US
2079,US,"Honeydew melon and a touch of cream on the midpalate of this dry, medium-bodied Chardonnay add a hint of luxury. Lightly toasted oak notes are pleasantly balanced along with a fresh, clean acidity.",US
2080,US,"There are light and airy elements of nectarine flesh and lemon blossoms on the nose of this first Chardonnay ever made by veteran Doug Margerum, who also imparts warmer scents of toast and clarified butter. The palate is tightly coiled, simultaneously soft with stone fruit and sharp with chalky texturality.",US
2081,US,"After making wine in Berkeley for just over a decade, the producer is working for the first time with Napa Valley fruit, grapes in fact farmed by grape-grower extraordinaire Steve Matthiasson. Pear, quince and grapefruit combine for a svelte sensibility, subtle in oak and sharp in acidity, with a tangy, herbal finish.",US
2082,US,"Very rich aromatically in golden Santa Rosa plum, raisins and lemon chiffon, this new producer's Chardonnay has a touch of caramel popcorn and is delicately dense with a nice lift on the finish.",US
2083,US,"Opens aromatically exhibiting lemon cheesecake, then delves into the rightful amount of apple and pear, finishing with a hearty helping of vanilla and caramel. Del Arroyo remains a source to watch in Livermore, especially for Chardonnay.",US
2084,US,"A really good value in a California Chardonnay. Blended with a touch of Viognier to add brightness, and fermented in a little new oak, it hits just the right notes for today's popular taste. Slightly sweet in buttered toast and pineapple jam flavors, it's balanced with crisp acidity and a stony minerality.",US
2085,US,"One of the leanest, most severe Chardonnays out there. In its favor is extreme dryness, elegance and a refreshing minerality. But the citrus flavors are so thin, there's just not much going on, and a little oak doesn't help. Simply lacks richness.",US
2086,US,"This soft, simple wine will satisfy your basic Chardonnay needs. It's creamy and somewhat sweet, with pineapple and buttered popcorn flavors.",US
2087,US,"A solid, all-purpose wine, this has some toast and vanilla components, along with straightforward fruit that hints at green apple. There's a little spice and butter in the aromas also.",US
2088,US,"A big, powerful and fruity Chardonnay, made in the classic style of this cool-climate vineyard. It's massive in pineapple, kumquat, buttered toast, vanilla cream and cinnamon spice flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Should develop mineral, nut and dried fruit notes over the years, if you want to cellar it.",US
2089,US,"Made in the popular style, this has flavors of buttered toast, orange, peach, Meyer lemon and vanilla bean, which are brightened by crisp acidity. Drink now.",US

2091,US,"This presents the opulence that many Chardonnay fans enjoy. It bears flavors of caramel, orange, pineapple, tapioca, vanilla, honey and cinnamon, which are wrapped in a creamy texture.",US
2092,US,"This is a strongly flavored Chardonnay. It packs a punch in ripe tropical citrus fruit, pear and vanilla oak flavors that are honey sweet on the finish. The acidity provides balance, but seems awkwardly applied.",US
2093,US,"There's a curtain of smoke and char that hides all the sweet, fresh apple tones on this creamy, full-bodied Chardonnay. When the smoke subsides, it reveals a fairly balanced wine with subtle vanilla and fruit characteristics throughout. Great companion for smoked cheese and charcuterie.",US
2094,US,"While aromatically restrained with a dry, savory character, this medium-bodied Chardonnay has a refreshing acidity that keeps it brisk. The finish, while not long, boasts a touch of honey on a pleasantly concentrated apple note.",US
2095,US,"The winery describes this as having little to no oak aging, and certainly, the grape fruit stars. Pineapples, Meyer lemons, limes and kiwis are front and center, accented with brisk Central Coast acidity.",US
2096,US,"There is an interesting floral component—white blossoms—coming through in the nose, and sailing along on top of flavors of buttered nuts. A somewhat oily mouthfeel is lifted by moderate acids, and the overall length and follow-through make this one of the better vintages of this affordably priced wine.",US
2097,US,"Just enough white peach and pineapple ripeness on the nose plays to the hedonistic side of the grape, but gracious notes of chalk dust and mandarin orange pith keep it intellectual. The palate is lively and citrus-driven, showing green apple, Bosc pear, salted lemons and more peach.",US
2098,US,"Rich and creamy, this beguiling wine offers a counterweight of lightness and balance, finding as much lemon and lime zest as baked apple and pear within its layers of flavor. Lifted in minerality, it offers accents of vanilla and honey on the finish, making the wine both complex and completely delicious.",US
2099,US,"A heady mixture of lemon custard and baked pear marks the entry to this full-bodied, deliciously decadent wine, from a high-elevation site above the Petaluma Gap. Honeyed aromas maintain themselves in the glass, accented in floral honeysuckle and ginger. Lovely and generous, it softens as it goes.",US
2100,US,"One of the world's most ambitious projects, this island-grown wine is starting to shine, with aromas of orange blossom, toasted Marcona almonds, walnut oil, marzipan and smoky flint. Those slightly oxidized notes are cut on the palate by lots of fresh lime juice and ruby-red grapefruit juice that shows alongside riper lemon cake flavors.",US
2101,US,"This lovely, golden-colored wine comes from the Dutton family's Mill Station Vineyard in the heart of Green Valley, a cool, structured appellation within the larger confines of the Russian River Valley. Heady caramel and vanilla highlights wrap around a balance of acidity and bright spots of lemon and quince. The minerality of the wine balances its intensity in expert ways.",US
2102,US,"This big-production wine from Stag's Leap hits all the popular Chardonnay buttons. It's soft and sweet, with orange and pineapple jam, buttercream, vanilla and toast flavors, brightened by crisp acidity. The grapes come from the cooler, southern parts of the valley.",US

2106,US,"Good and dry, with a firm scour of acidity and an earthiness to the pineapples and pears. This is a fine everyday Chardonnay at a fair price.",US
2107,US,"This pretty good everyday Chardonnay shows slightly sweet flavors of peaches, pineapples and mangoes brightened with crisp acidity. You could even make a summertime wine cooler with it.",US
2108,US,"Soft and sweet in vanilla, buttered toast and honey flavors, this Chard also features plenty of pineapple and pear jam richness. Good price for the opulence.",US
2109,US,"Made from some of Sonoma County's oldest Chardonnay plantings, this is an effusively floral wine, rounded and decadent on the midpalate, with a taste of fresh peach and melon. Fennel and vanilla make appearances, with the finish distinctly tropical.",US

2113,US,"A rewarding deal from the ocean-influenced vineyards of Edna Valley, this project by Nathan Carlson (general manager of the much higher-priced Center of Effort winery) delivers honey, salted nuts, tangerine zest and crushed limestone on the nose. Salinity is present on the palate, along with a lemon zing that lingers.",US
2114,US,A fully rich yet integrated Chardonnay that offers great value and clean flavors of golden apple and yellow fig and plenty of crisp acidity on the finish.,US
2115,US,"A rich, oaky Chardonnay, brimming with pure, ripe flavors of oranges, pears, limes and spicy tropical fruits. Has a creamy, honeyed taste that make it almost sweet, but it's fundamentally a dry table wine.",US

2117,US,"Layers of charred oak and smoked nuts give this this ripe, creamy Chardonnay a decidedly dark first impression, but the palate is remarkably juicy with soft, sweet honeydew notes. Hints of nut skin against generous cream and butter notes add a savory, bitter elegance to the finish.",US
2118,US,"Made in the popular style, with vanilla oak, cream and sweet buttered popcorn notes dominating the pineapples, apricots and peaches. Production was 8,093 cases.",US
2119,US,"Thin and dry, with oak and alcohol flavors modestly enriched with a touch of pineapples, green apples and minerals. Sadly, this is not the glorious Sonoma-Cutrer of the past.",US
2120,US,"Essentially a Washington Chardonnay (with just 6% of the fruit sourced in Oregon), this is sharp-toned and slightly volatile in the nose. It falls a little flat in the mouth, tasting like a soft banana, and fades quickly.",US
2121,US,"Reminiscent of baked apple tart, opulent fruit provides richness and concentration equally buoyed by lemony acidity. Vanilla and honey make appearances on the palate before structured crispness forms on the finish. The wine is a blend from the Sangiacomo and Rodgers Creek vineyards.",US

2125,US,"This Chardonnay is rich and balanced, with brisk acidity and deep, long flavors of limes, tangerines and Meyer lemons.",US
2126,US,"Not afraid to wear high alcohol and toasty oak on its sleeve, it kicks off with a marshmallow, whipped cream and macadamia-nut nose, making it perfect for those who love the California cocktail style but are seeking nuance as well. On the palate, the wine is soft and buttery, with a long buttercream finish. Pair with oven-roasted chicken.",US
2127,US,"Packs a lot of bang for your buck. Explodes in pineapple jam, vanilla cream and buttered toast flavors. Could be a little more subtle, but it has the richness people like in a Chardonnay.",US
2128,US,"Not much going on in this Chardonnay-based Port-style wine. Its not particularly sweet, with basic white chocolate and pineapple cream flavors.",US
2129,US,"There's an exciting array of aromas on the nose of this wine, with honeydew melon, citrus candy and barely ripe cantaloupe gaining complexity thanks to fresh scents of chive, oregano and thyme. It's light and easy on the palate, with lots of yellow grapefruit freshness, a pithy edge and a singing acidity on the finish.",US
2130,US,"A faint smoky character wafts through warm, inviting aromas of lemon peels, nectarine and sea salt on the nose of this wine from Monterey County. There is a lot of energetic acidity on the palate, where even flavors of apple and pear are cut by lemon-lime briskness and a briny character.",US
2131,US,"Not much going on with this dry, crisp Chardonnay. It has watery flavors of citrus fruits and apricots, with a hint of oak.",US
2132,US,"A very nice, elegant Chardonnay that shows plenty of creamy, oaky richness of pineapples, limes and pears, but also a crisp streak of acidity and minerality that provides grounding and balance. A good example of Russian River precision.",US
2133,US,"Dry and acidic, this Chardonnay has a herbaceous earthiness, plus flavors of orange and pear.",US
2134,US,"This unoaked effort sure tastes sweet, with flavors of sugared orange, mango and apple juice. The acidity is fine, giving balance to the sweetness.",France
2135,US,"This tastes strongly oaked, and it shows in the form of buttered toast and caramel notes. The flavors of mango, pear and apricot meld with the brisk acidity and firm minerality.",US
2136,US,"No oak to interfere with the ripe, opulent flavors of pineapples, lemons, limes and tangerines, which are brightened and heightened by crisp acidity. The price is right on this balanced, savory Chardonnay.",US
2137,US,"There's a gorgeous floral and citrus bouquet upon entry, followed by lithe flavors of orange blossom and zest. From an estate-grown vineyard, the wine is balanced and elegant, with a twist of pineapple custard on the finish.",US
2138,US,"Now officially labeled from the newly named Malibu Coast appellation, this bottling shows lots of potential for the region. Aromas of lush lemonade, crushed vanilla, browned butter, honeysuckle and honey lead into a soft and lush palate that's buttery but high-toned. Flavors of toasted bread with orange marmalade prove warm but tartly dynamic.",US
2139,US,"Light, tart, slightly green fruit flavors don't add up to much. There is an undertone of old barrel or something not quite fresh. Simple and plain.",US
2140,US,"New oak dominates this Chardonnay, lending buttered toast, vanilla and caramel aromas and flavors, while the underlying fruit veers toward very ripe, sweet pineapples. Made in the modern style, it will appeal to Chardonnay lovers of flash, but ultimately palls for too much upfront sweetness.",US
2141,US,"A thoughtful blend from vineyards representing the Wahluke Slope, Yakima Valley and Columbia Gorge AVAs. Complex and nuanced, this weaves together peaches, apples, honeydew melon, pepper, cinnamon and a vein of clean, wet rock. Great structure suggests this could be cellared for another five or six years.",US
2142,US,"Rich in citrus and tropical fruit flavors, but superbly dry and crisp in cool-climate acidity, with a wonderful, stony minerality. Comes down squarely on the dry, steely side of the Chardonnay spectrum, but no less complex and interesting.",US
2143,US,"A beautiful Chardonnay, creamy, dry and elegant. There's a tangy minerality underlying the rich tropical fruit, apple, pear and buttered toast flavors. This is an elegant and sophisticated wine from the Carneros region.",US
2144,US,"Thin and generic, this could be any basic white wine. It's got a splash of Sauvignon Blanc and Gewürztraminer in the blend, but falls flat in the mouth, with a little celery and green apple flavor quickly fading.",US
2145,US,"Pretty standard Chardonnay, with a creamy texture and flavors of buttered popcorn, caramel corn and pineapple Life Savers candy.",US
2146,US,"With all of the buttered toast, buttered popcorn and butterscotch flavors, this Chardonnay's fruit isn't allowed to speak. It has brisk acidity and rich tangerine and mango flavors, but the winemaker's hand feels heavy.",France
2147,US,"Rich, savory and seemingly slightly sweet, this Chardonnay has acidity that provides balance to the rich flavors of tangerines, golden mangoes, limes and honey. Drink this with Chinese or Vietnamese fare.",France
2148,US,"Gregory Graham's first Lake County Chardonnay, this wine has notes of vanilla custard, lemon and toasty oak.",US
2149,US,"On the nose and palate, notes of smoke and roasted nuts add earthy tones to the touches of crisp apple and lemon. It's dry and full bodied, with a round, soft fruitiness on the finish.",US
2150,US,"Pretty oaky, with a flood of caramel and buttered toast, and you have to wonder why they plastered so much barrel influence, because the underlying wine is pretty good. Buried under the wood is a dry, crisp Chardonnay with pineapple, pear, floral and mineral flavors. Give it a good decant and don't serve too cold.",US
2151,US,"A bit heavy on the oak, with vanilla, caramel and buttered toast aromas and flavors. But the pineapple and apple fruit is nice and ripe, and the finish is rich in spicy honey.",US
2152,US,"This is a high acid, dry and minerally Chardonnay that you can call Chablisian. It has flavors of grilled lemons, limes and pineapples, with richer notes of sweet oak and lees and the buttered toast of oak. Defined by elegance, it should develop bottle complexities over the next three or four years.",US
2153,US,"Candied ginger and nougat wrap themselves around toasted oak and fierce acidity in this full-bodied, voluptuous white that veers confidently into measured decadence. Intense in ripe apple, pear and vanilla oak, it finishes fresh and vibrant on the palate.",US
2154,US,"Layered and luxurious, this medium-bodied wine tastes ripe and flavorful but not overdone, melding bright fruit flavors, almond and vanilla accents and a creamy texture that extends the finish. Suitable for a special occasion, this wine shows off the grape's inherent complexity.",US
2155,US,"For a full-bodied wine, this one has subtle flavors, but an appealing and generous mouthfeel and good supportive acidity keeps it balanced. Sophisticated almond and fig flavors emerge on second and third sips while the wine keeps its attractive dryness and sense of reserve.",US
2156,US,"Smoky and toasty, with well-defined acidity, this flavorful Chardonnay matches the barrel notes to light tropical and stone fruits—peach and papaya.",US
2157,US,"Too acidic, almost sour, and pretty sweet, with pineapple and orange flavors. Gets the Chardonnay job done, but seems pricey for what you get.",US
2158,US,"Nicely dry, tart in acidity and clean, but flavor-wise, there's not much going on. The tastes are of minerals and alcohol, with a squirt of citrus juice.",US
2159,US,"A tartly acidic, slightly green wine, with mineral, peach, green grape and pineapple flavors. Turns sweet-and-sour on the finish.",US
2160,US,"Shows sweet-and-sour pineapple and orange fruit flavors, like a Chinese restaurant duck sauce. Lacks balance and sophistication, but will please fans of the style.",US
2161,US,"Made in the drier, leaner, earthier and more Chablisian style that's increasingly popular, this Chardonnay is a natural for food pairings, such as shellfish. It's a minerally wine, with elegant citrus, kiwi and pear flavors and a streamlined complexity.",US
2162,US,"All Stillwater Creek fruit and 100% varietal, this bright and spicy, unoaked Chardonnay showcases very pretty fresh herb along with the usual green apple and pear fruit flavors. Lively and light, despite its 14.4% alcohol, it's a versatile and refreshing white.",US
2163,US,"This vineyard has proved itself for so many years that it's practically a guarantee of greatness. This 2008 is a real stunner. It's so rich and exotic, so balanced and dry, so clean. Dazzles with pear, pineapple, lychee, roasted hazelnut, crème brûlée, buttered toast, honey and spice flavors, wrapped into a creamy smooth mouthfeel. Brilliant and compelling. Drink now.",US
2164,US,"It's easy to get ripe fruit in California and then plaster it in oak, but what's so difficult to achieve is the crisp, minerally structure this wine displays. It's rich in pineapple cream, Key lime pie, Meyer lemon sorbet, golden mango and vanilla oak flavors, but achieves balanced elegance with crisp acidity and a wonderful stony purity. Only 349 cases produced.",US
2165,US,"An awesome Chardonnay that gives everything you want in richness, yet frames it in a structural integrity rare in California. Dazzles with tropical fruit, green apple and pear flavors, with a brilliant overlay of oak that adds buttered toast and spice flavors, not to mention sturdy oak tannins. But it's the zesty acidity, like a squirt of lime juice, that really elevates this wine.",US
2166,US,"Soft and somewhat waxy in texture, this is a dry, muted Chardonnay. The flavors suggest sweet hay and light tree fruits, and the finish fades quickly.",US
2167,US,"The vineyard is far better known for powerful, concentrated Pinot Noir, and this Chardonnay shares those characteristics. It's a big, fruity wine, not showing much finesse, but plenty of sheer magnitude. Brims with tropical fruit, apple, exotic spice and oak flavors that finish dry. Could do interesting things over the years.",US
2168,US,"Ripeness of fruit characterizes this Chardonnay. It brims with pineapple tart, green apple, vanilla, meringue, buttercream and cinnamon flavors, with a good cut of acidity.",US
2169,US,"Strong and ripe and oaky. Not showing much subtlety, but a very good example of the modern California style. It's a clean, vibrant Chardonnay starring massive flavors of pineapple tart, Meyer lemon custard and tangerines, brightened with zesty acidity.",US
2170,US,"Fruity and oaky, with pineapple, mango, tangerine, vanilla and buttered toast flavors. Shows lots of the same characteristics of far more expensive Chardonnays, which makes it a good buy.",US
2171,US,"Lots of sweet, smoky oak on this wine, with flavors of pineapples, peaches, limes, vanilla and honey. It's balanced with crisp acidity. Drink now.",US
2172,US,"Almost as good as some of the winery's best single-vineyard bottlings, this wine has a tremendous nose that offers tangerine blossom, pink grapefruit skin, sea salt and toast around a line of graphite. The palate presents juicy nectarine and ripe citrus alongside yeasty sizzle, salt and a chalk minerality.",France
2173,US,"From a vineyard full of gravelly loam soils, the nose on this wine shows a mix of citrus freshness and more complex qualities of dried apples, quinine, pencil lead and nuts. A slight yogurt element shows on the palate, along with grapefruit pith and a nectarine warmth, leaving the mouth quite energized into the finish.",US
2174,US,"This wine, from a new collaboration between San Miguel vintner David DuBois and Santa Ynez winemaker Andres Ibarra, shows excellently on the nose, with apple blossoms, white peach flesh, cold butter, seared lemons and garden herbs. The dynamic, engaging palate is framed by pencil shavings and browned butter, with lemon peels, nectarine flesh and hints of salted pineapple.",US
2175,US,"Acidity marks this wine, so much that it's practically sparkling. It's also exorbitantly ripe in pineapple and orange jam, with lots of sweet, caramelized new oak. The overall impression is one of a heavily overworked Chardonnay, but it is not without a certain hedonistic appeal.",US
2176,US,"Judicious use of oak makes Keuka Spring stand out in a line-up of Finger Lakes Chards. Subtle on the nose with whiffs of fresh apple and toasted hazelnuts, the wine's palate is quite full with luscious sweet melon, vanilla and cream. Hints of smoke and burnt sugar add a dimension of darkness to the finish.",US
2177,US,"Fruit-juice sweet, like a pineapple, orange and peach drink, with high, almost sour acidity. Gets the Chardonnay job done.",US
2178,US,"This simple Chardonnay is soft and sweet, with some vanilla oaky notes. It's made in the popular style.",US
2179,US,"Sweet and simple in apricot and pineapple flavors, with a heavy coating of caramelized oak. Drinkable, but disagreeably fruit-juicy.",US
2180,US,"This Chardonnay in a box is the equivalent of four regular bottles, but it's not a very good wine. It's ultradry and acidic, with unripe, vegetal flavors that just approach citrus fruits.",France
2181,US,"The Two Vines Chardonnay is simple, clean and reliable. Suggestions of green apple and white peach appear on the palate.",US
2182,US,"Lots of acidity and dryness in this Chardonnay. It will strike some as austere and lean. But it's fascinating in its citrus fruits and minerals, which seem to come from the stones of the Arroyo Seco. Oak influence adds much-needed notes of buttered toast. Gets better and better as it warms in the glass.",US
2183,US,"A deliciously savory wine, brisk in lip-smacking acidity, with the strong, pure flavors of limes, Meyer lemons and kiwi fruits that mark this cool climate region of San Luis Obispo County. Pretty much as good as Edna Valley Chardonnay gets. Drink now.",US
2184,US,"Shows the dry earthiness that often marks Carneros Chardonnay, with an herb and tobacco grounding to the riper pineapples and peaches. Oak, of course, adds sweet notes of vanilla and buttercream. There's also a cut of acidity.",US
2185,US,"This feels just a little bit thin, with a yeasty/beery character. Highlights of lemon oil and orange peel ripple through, into a finish with a suggestion of heat. Further bottle age might improve the score.",US
2186,US,"Rich and fruity, with tons of pineapple, mango, lime, peach, pear, nectarine and honey flavors. Lots of sweet smoky oak, too. Not particularly complex, but flashy. Drink now.",US
2187,US,"A crowd-pleasing Chardonnay aromatically suggestive of candied fruit and dried apricot, it offers a healthy dose of minerality amidst a well-composed structure. Striking the right balance between fleshy and firm, it'll go well with just about anything.",France
2188,US,"A good, complex wine, although it does show the limitations of so many Napa Valley Chardonnays. The pineapple, pear and oak flavors have an earthy, herbal edge, and the wine lacks some vibrancy. Gets better as it approaches room temperature, so don't chill it too much.",US
2189,US,"From a single vineyard now designated as a monopole, this wine by winemaker Bill Brousseau, who designed the vineyard, and vintners Rob Jensen and Kirk Williams shows minty herbs and tangerine oil on the nose. There is great restraint on the palate that walks a razor's edge of balance, with flavors of tart Key lime pith and riper orange blossom.",US
2190,US,"Vegetal, with an asparagus edge to the citrus fruit flavors. That mars this otherwise clean, dry and zesty Chardonnay.",US
2191,US,"Very tart, almost sour in acidity, with unnaturally sweet pineapple, buttered toast and caramel flavors.",US
2192,US,"A bit vegetal, and a bit sweet on the finish in pineapple candy. Not particularly successful.",US
2193,US,"Even though this wine is nicely dry and crisp, it's too vegetal, with a green bean taste.",US
2194,US,"Here's a simple wine that tastes like a supermarket fruit juice blend of peaches, mangoes and apricots. It's soft and one-dimensional and slightly sweet in the finish.",US
2195,US,"A near replica of the wonderful 2007, and an equally powerful value. Enormously rich and attractive in pineapple cream, golden mango, lemon chiffon pie, buttered toast and dusty spice flavors; crisp Central Coast acidity makes it alive and vibrant. Only 400 cases produced, but worth the search.",US
2196,US,"Awesomely rich, showing fine acidity and a stony minerality that ground and anchor it, but really notable for the explosive tropical fruit, apricot, pear and buttery oak flavors that are so opulent. The wine went through a complete malolactic fermentation.",US
2197,US,"A fine Chardonnay, showing cool weather influence in the brisk acidity and ripe flavors, which veer toward tart green apples, peaches and tangerines. The oak has been tastefully applied.",US
2198,US,"Although new oak accounts for only 10% of the barrels used, the oak influence dominates. Flavors of buttered toast, butterscotch and vanilla ride over the note of pineapple-orange jam. The best thing about the wine is its brisk, clean acidity.",US
2199,US,"Enormously rich in pineapple jam, crème brûlée, buttercream, toast and cinnamon spice flavors, this wine's richness is balanced with crisp, citrusy acidity. It offers direct appeal now.",US
2200,US,"Superripe and rich in tropical fruit, pineapple, kiwi and golden mango flavors, with additional notes of buttered toast and caramel. Fortunately, crisp Monterey acidity provides a brisk, clean finish. Drink now.",US
2201,US,"A rich, oaky Chardonnay, overwhelming in buttered toast, caramel, pineapple jam, crème brûlée and cinnamon spice flavors. If you're looking for a big, strong Chardonnnay, it's for you.",US
2202,US,Luscious cream and butter notes are balanced by a bright orange-lemon acidity on this opulent Hudson River Chardonnay. Ripe honeydew lingers sweetly on the palate before ending on a slightly saline note.,US
2203,US,"This particular bottling by the fine Patz & Hall winery often seems too ripe and oaky. The '09 exhibits these issues. It's fantastically rich in tangerine, apricot, pear and peach flavors, and while the new oak is only 40%, it dominates for some reason in the form of sweet butterscotch and vanilla cream. Delicious and impressive, but lacks subtlety in favor of power.",US
2204,US,"From two vineyard sites, Martaella and Martinelli Frei Road, this lovely wine is built from the ground up, with elements of rich vanilla, toasted oak and baked pear. Big in style on the nose, it finishes crisp and focused, a mixture of complexity and lightness of being.",US
2205,US,"Soft and sugary sweet, with pineapple jam flavors. Lots of people will like it, but it's a pretty common Chardonnay.",US
2206,US,"Disjointed from the start, this wine never pulls itself together. Cracker, oily fruit, overripe apples, and some burn in the finish.",US
2207,US,"If this is the reserve, I'd hate to taste the regular. There's almost no fruit, with only a drop of citrus swimming in the alcohol and acidity.",US
2208,US,"Clean, zesty and flavorful Chardonnay, with complex notes of pineapples, oranges, Meyer lemon tart, buttered toast and spices. Earns extra points for fine acidity and a bracing minerality.",US
2209,US,"This Chardonnay has brisk, crisp acidity and flavors of pineapple, orange and mango. There are dominating notes of buttered toast and sweet butterscotch.",US
2210,US,"Seemingly sweet and simple, this has flavors of candied orange, peach and tropical fruit. A brisk hit of acidity provides much-needed balance.",US
2211,US,"This is a light, bright Chardonnay that would be a great wine to serve at casual dining situations or at larger gatherings. The finish bears an acidic kick",France
2212,US,"Vinified in 100% new French oak, this is young, tight and showing the barrel flavors more than the fruit. As it opens, in come flavors of citrus skin, lemon drop and caramel. It's quite acidic, with good structure, and still has a yeasty finish.",US
2213,US,"Though Columbia Crest is widely available, the reserve tier is not. Just a few hundred cases of this reserve were made, done in an oaky, buttered popcorn style. Think California with more acidity.",US
2214,US,"From two vineyard sites, Martaella and Martinelli Frei Road, this lovely wine is built from the ground up, with elements of rich vanilla, toasted oak and baked pear. Big in style on the nose, it finishes crisp and focused, a mixture of complexity and lightness of being.",US
2215,US,"This wine offers a pleasing mixture of aromas and flavors of baking spices, pear and apple. Viscosity and weight gives it a sense of gravitas but never gets bogged down.",US
2216,US,"Crisp, yet fuller bodied, with a creamy voluptuousness to the mouthfeel, this wine offers a taste of lemon pith and peach, accented by a floral bouquet of orange blossom. Measured acidity keeps it ebullient in the glass, ending in a hit of Tahitian vanilla.",US
2217,US,"Those who buy this wine because it has a cool label will not be disappointed by the fresh 'n' clean aromas of lemon rind, chalk, nectarine, pink peach and lemonade. The tight and bright palate is also a plus, with a limestone character cutting the ripe apple fruit, proving even-keeled and easy to drink.",US
2218,US,"Total California style here, a rich, sweet, honeyed Chardonnay marked by tiers of pineapples, mangos, pears and limes. It's all flash and dazzle for drinking now.",US
2219,US,"Touched by minerality and light in style, this Chardonnay from new producer Hannah Nicole is sippable with tart pear and apple and very high tones of lemon zest, its acidity high.",US
2220,US,"Slightly spritzy, with lime green and lemon yellow fruits in abundance. A slight hint of vitamin pill. Overall fresh and light, with clean fruit and engaging acidity.",US
2221,US,"Amazingly rich and ripe, defining the Bien Nacido cool-climate style. The grapes hung for a long time in this excellent vintage, getting ripe and balanced, and the wine offers dazzling opulence, while preserving vital acidity. Showcases dessert pastry flavors of pineapples, mangoes, buttered toast, buttercream, meringue and honeysuckle, accented with dusty spices. Simply beautiful from first sniff to the last swallow.",US
2222,US,"A best-of-barrels selection from the winery's various vineyards, this is a lush, intricate Chardonnay made in the modern style. It's fantastically rich in pineapple tart flavors, with the sweet, smoky crust, and more acidic citrus notes of Meyer lemons and limes. Oak aging and lees add fortunate layers of buttered toast and cream. Very intricate, with Chablisian dryness and minerality. Now–2014.",US
2223,US,"About as rich and flamboyant as California Chardonnay gets, a wine that blows you away with sheer pyrotechnic wizardry. Massive in grilled pineapples, mangoes, Key lime pie, vanilla honey, crème caramel and dusty spices, accented with perfect acidity.",US
2224,US,"A beautiful Chardonnay for drinking now. It's dry and crisp, with pineapple, peach and pear flavors accented with vanilla oak and creaminess from lees aging. Despite the richness, there's a firm minerality, a tang of steel that makes the wine bracing. The grapes are from a vineyard in the southerly, cool Coombsville area, an area that needs its own appellation.",US
2225,US,"Shows all the richness you could want in a Chardonnay, with smoky, buttery flavors of pineapples, lemons and pears, wrapped into a smooth, creamy mouthfeel. A scour of minerals gives the wine a steely grounding, while brilliant acidity makes the finish ultraclean. Really beautiful, a top Russian River Chardonnay at a fair price for the quality. The vineyard is in the cool Green Valley.",US
2226,US,"Extremely rich and ripe, with tremendous pineapple, pear, mango and white flower flavors that have been liberally oaked. Shows a touch of bitterness in the finish, which is probably the result of its age. Still, it's a flamboyant, impressive Chardonnay, like a magnificent old tapestry that's fraying a bit around the edges.",US
2227,US,"Awesomely rich, with massive tropical fruit, pear, vanilla cream and buttered toast flavors, finished with cinnamon spice. Acidity is high and crisp, and a bright scour of minerals brings balance. Made in the modern style, this is a Chardonnay to drink with lobster and scallops.",US
2228,US,"This is a luscious, butterscotchy, fresh, lime- and lemon-flavored Chardonnay; a true delight. Melon and peach fruit flavors thread into the core, and the wine has a wonderful richness without losing its finesse or acid base.",US
2229,US,"Lush in pineapple cream, Key lime pie, kiwi fruit, white peach and apricot flavors, this Chardonnay is as rich as they come. There's also a welcome overlay of zesty, citrusy acidity. The finish is honey sweet, in the modern style.",US
2230,US,"This smells and tastes like vanilla, mango and honeysuckle. While the alcohol level is relatively modest, it is apparent.",US
2231,US,Caramelized oak and tangerine jam flavors give this Chardonnay a honeyed sweetness that would appeal consumers who enjoy modern-style wines. The high alcohol gives it a peppery burn.,US
2232,US,"This wine shows real first-growth quality in its intensity and concentration, with orange nectar, golden mango, pear, peach pie, buttercream, vanilla, buttered toast and spice flavors. The balance is exquisite, and the way the acids dance along the palate make the wine clean and lively.",US
2233,US,"Winemaker Bob Cabral's three 2010 Chardonnays are possibly the greatest he's ever made. This bottling shows fabulous complexity and sheer deliciousness, offering intricate notes of butterscotch, tropical fruit, pear tart, golden apricot, vanilla cream, buttered toast and exotic spice, with perhaps just a trace of honey. Its brilliant acidity and a tangy minerality provide the balance that pushes this wine off the charts.",US
2234,US,"The acidity really makes this Chardonnay come alive, providing vitality, a quality that's boosted by an undercurrent of minerals. It's so rich in tropical fruit, orange, nectarine and pear flavors, and so generously oaked, which brings a sweet, satisfying note of buttered toast, that all you want to do is drink it now, preferably with steamed lobster and melted butter.",US
2235,US,"From two blocks of the vineyard, this light, crisp, medium-weighted wine stays refreshing on the palate and remains complex in acidity. Nutmeg dances throughout its soft layers, while the finish burnishes in rich vanilla brioche.",US
2236,US,"Very high-toned for a relatively affordable wine, this shows Key lime pith, Greek yogurt, scratched pink grapefruit skin and a fresh 7-Up soda liveliness on the nose. Anjou peas, seared green apples, lime zest and nectarine power the pleasant energy on the palate, which wipes up clean with a vanilla finish.",US
2237,US,"Warm butter and white peach aromas are cut by sea salt and brisk lemon-peel sharpness on this single-vineyard study by winemaker Bill Brousseau. Ripe apple, juicy lime, more salt and a crisp minerality mark the palate.",US
2238,US,"This is a big, rich Chardonnay even though it never saw a splinter of oak. It's tremendous in pear, green apple and vanilla flavors. A nice price for a flashy, everyday Chard.",US
2239,US,"Chardonnays from this vineyard always are powerful, but this bottling is over the top. It has ultraripe apricot and tangerine flavors, with strong acidity. Seems almost botrytised, with a honeyed intensity, although it's dry.",US
2240,US,"Unoaked and quite dry, this young Chardonnay will show best accompanied by soft cheeses or light seafood. Light and juicy, with sharp green apple fruit flavors.",US
2241,US,"Very ripe, rich and new-oaky, with dazzling flavors of ripe pineapples, pears, limes, caramel and buttered toast, drizzled with vanilla honey. A crowd-pleasing Chardonnay of enormous power and concentration. Could use a touch more nuance and complexity, but a tremendous wine at a good price for the quality.",US
2242,US,"Not for fans of rich Chardonnays, this is a very dry, acidic bottling. It's more about clean mouthfeel and scour than hedonism. What fruit there is suggests limes, pears and brisk minerals, while smoky oak and lees contribute toasty, buttery, creamy notes. A distinguished and elegant wine that defines cool-climate coastal conditions. Grows more complex and interesting as it warms in the glass.",US
2243,US,"A very rich Chardonnay, notable for its complex flavors of pineapples, sweet Meyer lemons, Key lime pie, buttered toast and smoky caramelized oak. Acidity is quite high, and plays a role in the way it tingles and cleanses the mouth. There's a fresh, jammy quality that makes the wine taste younger than its almost three years. Should develop in the bottle through 2013.",US
2244,US,"Delicate orange peel and marmalade scents intensify on the palate with deeply concentrated citrus and crushed-stone notes on this dry, medium-bodied Chardonnay. Zesty acidity and a delicious lime pith flavor linger on the finish.",US

2247,US,"An elaborate Chardonnay whose high acidity and minerality are reflections of both the vintage and Carneros terroir. Shows bright, zesty flavors of pineapples, tangerines and green apples, while lots of opulent new French oak brings vanilla and toast richness, as well as supportive wood tannins.",US
2248,US,"Bergström's Sigrid is one of the finest Chardonnays made in Oregon. Racy and refined, it shows Burgundian finesse, toast and acidity. As in other top tier wines from the Northwest, the fruit has a certain vibrancy that shouts “New World.” Peach, apple and pear flavors abound.",US
2249,US,"Rich and opulent, a Chardonnay that swings for a home run and hits a solid double. Shows oak-inspired flavors of grilled pineapples, peaches, pears and minerals, balanced by crisp acidity, with a dry finish.",US
2250,US,"This bottling goes for a ripe, buttery style of Chardonnay and succeeds. Pillowy aromas of buttered popcorn, plumeria flowers and vanilla-laced peach brûlée play into candied apples on the palate along with ripe cantaloupe and a long finish of vanilla-soaked poached pears.",US
2251,US,"Fermented and aged in new French oak, this wine shows pleasing pear and apple aromas along with toast and baking spices. The medium-bodied flavors show refinement, depth and balance.",US
2252,US,"Fresh and approachable but lean and focused on the nose, this wine shows chalk, wet slate, iodine and mandarin orange oil aromas. It's extremely limey and quinine-driven on the tangy palate, with the judicious acidity of squeezed lime and tangerine juice.",US
2253,US,"Quite buttery and rich, this bottling shows lemon custard, ripe yellow melon, white peach and buttermilk on the lavish nose. The palate is lush and attention-grabbing, with poached and grilled peach flavors lifted by citrus energy and a vanilla-laced finish.",US
2254,US,"The fruity flavors of pineapples, mangoes and papayas burst from this wine, with a rich layer of smoky, caramelized oak. Almost as sweet as a dessert pastry, it's made to appeal to the popular Chardonnay palate.",US
2255,US,"With a taste of white sugar and honey, this Chardonnay can't really be described as dry. But it is clean and vibrant in acidity, with rich pineapple jam and green apple flavors, and the underlying tang of minerals helps to ground it.",US
2256,US,"Tastes pretty sweet, with a sugar and honeysuckle richness. But the tangerine fruit flavor is deep and impressive, and the vanilla and buttered toast notes from oak are what consumers like.",US
2257,US,"A light floral nose carries inviting scents of honeysuckle and clover, with just a hint of cut grass. The fruit is clean and apple-flavored, and carries a touch of cinnamon, perhaps from the neutral barrel fermentation.",US
2258,US,"The largest Chardonnay parcel in the Thomas Fogarty estate portfolio at slightly more than four acres, this slice still only amounts to four barrels of wine. The 2011 starts with a candied, chalky smell, reminiscent of white Smarties, and the flavors lean toward cooked stone fruit, such as caramelized pluot, and charred daffodil.",US
2259,US,"An elaborate Chardonnay, ripe in orange, apple and pear flavors. Oak adds the usual notes of buttered toast. It's rich and flashy, but despite a vibrant minerality, it lacks that drink-me-again factor.",US
2260,US,"This is the winery's unoaked Chardonnay. It shows how well this cool-climate valley ripens Chardonnay, with deep, long tangerine, apricot and pear flavors, accompanied by brisk acidity. It's quite good, but would actually be better with a little oak to fatten and complicate it.",US
2261,US,"Really delicious, a rich, opulent wine that beguiles from first sip to last. It's sweetly caramelized and vanilla-oaky, with crisp acidity brightening ultraripe flavors of pineapples, golden mangoes and buttered toast.",US
2262,US,"Made in a leaner, acidic, minerally style, this bone-dry wine feels ultra-clean and distinguished in the mouth. It's austere, but you'll find a core of pineapples, apples and limes. Great with a shellfish-inspired risotto. Elegant and food-friendly, it should develop over the next 4–5 years.",US
2263,US,"Fruity and oaky, this Chardonnay is made in the modern California style of immediate palate appeal. It's not especially complex or ageworthy, but has crowd-pleasing flavors of pineapple tart, crème brûlée and vanilla cookies.",US
2264,US,"A wine of surpassing vitality and complexity, it mixes notes of melon, jicama and citrus in a fine-tuned flavor explosion. Long and lively, with bracing minerality, it finishes with a fresh lick of sweet herb.",US

2266,US,"A reductive element of petrol and oak blows off over time bouquet-wise, but in taste and weight, the wine retains a sultry sense of oak and baked apple. Full bodied in style, it manages to stay balanced throughout, finishing in a buoyant twist of citrus.",US
2267,US,"Heavy wafts of petrol and oak dominate at first in this wine, before some air and some swirling in the glass reveal more lifted aromas and flavors of lemon candy, green apple and apple tart. A tale of two wines in some ways, it zigzags between crisp and luxurious, finding its balance in the glass.",US
2268,US,"Sweet, rich and oaky, marked by flavors of buttered popcorn, toast, pineapple jam and ripe apricots. Made in the modern style that will be liked by many, but not particularly sophisticated.",US
2269,US,"Casa Larga's American Oak is lusciously creamy with sweet butter and salted caramel notes, but subtle enough to allow a host of pretty orange blossom and lemon flavors to shine through. Finishes on a freshly baked brioche note.",US
2270,US,"Toast and smoke linger over fresh apple pie and apple blossom notes on this deeply concentrated Chardonnay. There's a lot of oak-derived vanilla and butterscotch, but the pure fruit palate is persistent.",US
2271,US,"The 2005 vintage was a very great one for Iron Horse. This 100% Chardonnay reflects the perfect growing conditions. It's dry and especially elegant, with rich brioche, lime and green apple flavors, and a firm minerality in the finish. Drink now.",US
2272,US,"Made of equal parts ultraripe pineapple and exotic lime fruit, coupled with sweet, smoky crème brûlée and buttered toast from oak and lees stirring, this is a super-rich Chardonnay. Don't drink it too cold; it matures and knits together as it breathes in the glass.",US
2273,US,"Opulent and captivating, this Chard captures the rich, bells and whistles style of California, while maintaining a sense of style and elegance. Coastal acidity provides a bracing structure for the ripe pineapple, lime, pear, white flower and mineral flavors.",US
2274,US,"This is a very rich Chardonnay. It has complex, lush flavors of pineapples, lemons, limes, oranges and the smoky vanilla notes from 100% new oak. High acidity fortunately provides crisp balance. Almost too much of a good thing, it calls for equally rich fare, such as lobster or Ahi tuna tartare.",US
2275,US,"This is an austere Chardonnay whose minerality and acidity star. That's not to say it's not fruity. It has pineapple and green apple flavors, with oak and lees adding richer complexities. Still, it's a firm, Chablis-style wine, and a very good one that defines the elegant sleekness of the Sonoma Coast.",US
2276,US,"This new, patriotic Rosenblum Cellars project kicked off with a $100,000 gift to the USO. This affordable but well-manicured wine begins with aromas of caramelized lemon peel and faint peach that carry through to the palate, alongside a lingering note of toasted vanilla. Seeming to evolve steadily as it sits in the glass, it would wash down an even more affordable bucket of fried chicken.",US
2277,US,"A little too soft and sweet for balance, with flavors like the melted filling of pineapple tart, lemon meringue pie and vanilla custard. Alcohol adds a nice, balancing burn.",US

2281,US,"Very dry, crisp and minerally, with subtle citrus fruit and floral flavors, this Chardonnay suggests Chablis as its model. The elegant structure is likeable. If you're a fan of big fruit, it's not for you, but it's quite a classy Chardonnay. Good with cracked crab with drawn butter and buttered sourdough bread.",US
2282,US,"Tastes honey sweet in butterscotch, buttered toast and caramel. The sweetness dominates well ripened pineapple and tangerine flavors. But the fruity power is there. It needs a year or so in the bottle to emerge, and even a brief decant will bring greater harmony to this expressively opulent wine.",US
2283,US,"This is a rich, flamboyant Chardonnay, built on a foundation of superripe pineapple, lime and golden mango fruit and elaborated with sweet, caramelized oak. Bright, zesty Edna Valley acidity balances the opulence.",US

2287,US,"The palate impression is of oak, lees and acidity, which give tart vanilla, buttered toast and sour cream flavors to an otherwise simple wine. When the palate searches for fruit, it finds modest pineapples, peaches and green apples.",US
2288,US,"This polished Napa Chardonnay would have benefited from brisker acidity, as it's somewhat soft. But the orange popsicle, lemon cream and buttered toast flavors are very rich.",US
2289,US,"Rich in fruit and oak, but balanced with crisp acidity. It's strongly flavored, brimming with pineapple jam, white peach, apricot, buttered toast and vanilla. Gets the Chardonnay job done with some elegance.",US
2290,US,"Luscious melon aromas, creamy fruit-tart flavors and a silky texture make a pleasing combination in this wonderfully soothing wine. A crisp core of lemon and apple flavors are surrounded by a layer of vanilla and hazelnut. The plus texture carries the flavors through a long finish.",US
2291,US,"Orange blossoms and toasted brioche tempt on the nose of this elegantly oaked Chardonnay. The palate is concentrated with pristine melon and floral flavors, and just a hint of dusty minerality in the backdrop.",US
2292,US,"Lots of crisp, citrusy acidity in this wine, which brightens the pineapple, orange, lemon and lime flavors. Meanwhile, 100% new oak adds a rich coating of smoky, buttered toast. The wine is dramatic, rather than subtle, and is at its best now.",US
2293,US,"This is a flashy Chardonnay, marked by scads of oak that contributes buttered toast and vanilla cream. You find rich fruit flavors of pineapples and golden mangoes, but they struggle to overcome the barrel influence. Still, there's no denying the opulence. Drink now.",US
2294,US,"A lovely Blanc de Blancs, bright and satisfying in lime, vanilla and toast flavors, with the yeasty complexity of a fine sparkling wine. Gains extra points for the smooth quality of the bubbles.",US
2295,US,"On the paler side of the the Chardonnay scale, the nose is subtle, with light touches of cream, butterscotch and smoke. There is a decent tension between ripe, lemongrass-like fruit and a bitter, grapefruit rind acidity in this wine from the team at Terravant Wine Company in Buellton.",US
2296,US,"The sophistication of Luisa Ponzi's wines increases from vintage to vintage, especially at the high end. Here is a Chardonnay for butter lovers, but there is much more to enjoy than just lush barrel flavors. Thick and full bodied, it has notes of caramel apple, poached pear and passion fruit, sprinkled with baking spices. It's a flavor jamboree.",US
2297,US,"An exotic, candied style of Chardonnay, almost in a class by itself, this offers flavors including pineapple, brown sugar, lemon drop, ginger and vanilla cookie, honey, green apple butter and baked pear. Texturally, the wine is dry, crisp in acidity and minerally, with a tang to the finish. There's nothing subtle here, so pair this with rich foods, and don't overchill the wine.",US
2298,US,"Soft and easy drinking, Hogue's value Chardonnay is brimming with fresh-sliced apple fruit. The mouthfeel is open and generous, with a splash of buttery caramel.",US
2299,US,"Rich and fruit-forward. Shows ripe flavors of pineapples, pears and apples, enriched with the smoke and buttered toast notes of oak, and the creamy, yeasty edge of lees. Best now for its flamboyance. From the Sangiacomo (83%) and Truchard (17%) vineyards.",US
2300,US,"There's a reductive element to the nose of this wine, indicating the powerful nature of the vintage but also the wine's youth. Let it open to unveil an intensity of baked apple and white peach, along with heartier highlights of crème brûlée and vanilla toast. With a medium body and length, it has enough acidity to remain vibrant. It's sourced from a who's who of the region's vineyards.",US
2301,US,"Shy aromas of crisp yellow apple and brown sugar follow up on the palate, with compelling hints of orange blossom along the way. Quaffable and likable, it's made from 100% Chardonnay and finishes mellow and refined.",US
2302,US,"From a vineyard site farmed by the Duttons called Matthew's Station, this is a gentle wine, medium in weight, with nuances of green apple and fresh-squeezed lemon. Balanced, it offers a twist of toffee and oak beneath its crisper notes, finishing warm in nutmeg and ginger spice.",US

2304,US,"This single-vineyard exploration shows a more tropical side than the winery's other Chardonnays. Rich, rounded notes of honeysuckle, lemon custard and apple cider characterize the nose. The palate is reserved compared to the showy aromas, with buttered peach and green-apple flavors.",US
2305,US,"Powerful and intense in flavors of pineapples, mangoes, sweet cream and buttered popcorn, with good acidity. Flamboyant, but it feels over-worked and too sweet.",US

2315,US,"Stainless steel fermented and aged Chardonnay (eg ‘naked') is becoming commonplace, but few offer as much snap and juicy fruitiness as this one. It's a great, round mouthful of grape juice, crisp green apple and suggestions of pineapple and citrus. A little fresh herb rounds out the finish.",US
2316,US,"A rich, fruity Chardonnay. Shows dry, acid-inspired flavors of grilled pineapples and smoky new oak. Could be smoother and more nuanced, but a very good wine.",US
2317,US,"This single-vineyard exploration shows a more tropical side than the winery's other Chardonnays. Rich, rounded notes of honeysuckle, lemon custard and apple cider characterize the nose. The palate is reserved compared to the showy aromas, with buttered peach and green-apple flavors.",US
2318,US,"Toasty oak and rich crème caramel are top of mind in this estate-grown wine, sourced from two distinct blocks on property planted to Clone 4, as well as the Platt Wente Clone. Together they combine to offer an intensity of body and texture, finishing softly in citrus and red apple.",US

2329,US,"Chateau Ste. Michelle has become one of the country's largest producers of Chardonnay. There are over half a million cases of this basic, Columbia Valley bottling alone.

2335,US,"This is an extraordinarily rich Chardonnay, built along Burgundian lines. A deep gold color, it explodes in tangerine-infused butterscotch, honeysuckle, citron, spice and tangy mineral flavors, and finishes with a savory bite of coastal acidity.",US
2336,US,"Very forward in fruit, offering a powerful wave of pineapples, oranges, lemons, limes and peaches. Fortunately, all this richness is dry, and brightened with crisp, tart acidity. Suggests a rich lobster or shrimp risotto.",US

2385,US,"Made from 100% Celilo vineyard fruit (though it is not stated on the label), this has a fine texture, from frequent battinage and sur lie aging.

2390,US,"This is the flagship Chardonnay from Thomas Fogarty Winery, a one-barrel lot that comes from a third-acre vineyard. And yet, from the winery's excellent 2011 line-up, it brings the least to the table. A zesty, grassy lemon-lime soda nose lands on the palate with Key lime and very little complication, making it pleasurable, but fairly breezy for the headiest of the Fogarty lot. Pair with halibut or seared scallops.",US
2391,US,"Seven Soils comes from six vineyards, spent 14 months in 28% new oak, and still seems a bit of a puzzle. It's a rather pale, modestly ripened wine, from a vintage that produced more than its share of blockbusters. It's perfectly fine, just not particularly memorable.",US
2392,US,"Winemaker Jim Law has fashioned a finessed Chardonnay that offers impressive purity and minerality, bearing Burgundian-like qualities. Notes of pear, green apple, kiwi and white currant are offset by a lemon-lime edge. It's all layered with streaks of blonde caramel and toasted hazelnut that add richness. The palate is clean, linear and vibrant, with a modicum of clove and a vein of liquid stone. The finish remains fresh and lifted.",US

2404,US,"Aggressively oaky, this buttery, toasty wine has the appeal of a classic California Chardonnay. It's a soft, fruity mix of melon and banana and papaya, with the buttery barrel flavors taking over on the finish, as it smooths into flavors of brioche and almond paste. Chill it well.",US
2405,US,"This barrel-fermented Chardonnay cloaks its thin fruit in aggressive flavors of wood and butter. The wine itself is soft and watery, quickly disappearing into a frail finish.",US
2406,US,"Too sweet in white sugared apricot and tangerine flavors, despite good acidity and a pleasant minerality. Tastes cloying from the get-go.",US
2407,US,"Very dry, with mouth-watering acidity, but the palate also searches for a little more fruit than the wine offers. Still, the pineapples, peaches and apricots are pleasant enough.",US
2408,US,"Vegetal, and the richer pineapple and vanilla cream flavors do nothing to make it go away. Through the dry, acidic mouthfeel, that taste of asparagus comes through.",US

2410,US,"Not much reserve going on with this soft, boring Chardonnay. It's dry and heavy in pineapple and lime pulp flavors.",US

2416,US,"In the past, the winery made a Mendocino appellation Chardonnay from a mix of Anderson Valley and Potter Valley fruit. But in 2010, all of the fruit is sourced from the Anderson Valley. This is fleshy, soft and lush, bearing grapefruit and fig flavors that are wrapped in a tightly focused package with a bright finish.",US

2425,US,Has extracted pineapple jam flavors and an oaky blanket that doesn't taste natural.,US
2426,US,"A great, enjoyable Chardonnay, extremely rich and ripe, but perfectly balanced. Crisp coastal acidity provides a clean boost to the enormous tropical fruit and peach flavors. The oak is strong, but in keeping with the size of the fruit, providing crème brûlée, buttered toast and smoky meringue opulence.",US

2432,US,"The aromas and tastes of oak dominate this Chardonnay, with buttered toast and sweet caramel riding high over the pineapple, mango and pear flavors.

2438,US,"This is the most citrusy of Testarossa's '07 Chards, brimming with Meyer lemon, lime and pineapple flavors. Smooth, smoky oak and lees add complex layers of butter, cream and tart yeastiness. Brilliant but immature, the wine should come into its own after 2009.",US
2439,US,"Native yeast, weekly batinage (lees stirring) in 50% new barrels, and, most importantly, a superb vineyard—Stillwater Creek—make for the best Chardonnay yet from Sparkman.

Crisp acidity and some dusty tannins frame pineapple tart and zesty green apple flavors, enriched with winemaker interventions of sweet oak and creamy lees. Classy and delicious.",US
2452,US,"Combines rich, vibrant acidity with fruity intensity in a very clean, opulent wine. Offers waves of tropical fruits, honeysuckle, buttered toast and minerals, with a long, spicy finish. The extensive new oak is perfectly in keeping with the size of this crowd-pleaser. Now–2014.",US
2453,US,"An excellent Finger Lakes pick, it's redolent with aromas of sweet apples and guava balanced with fresh-cut herbs and grass. The dry, full-bodied palate is rich and unctuous but freshened by a tart gooseberry and green plum acidity and a gravelly minerality in the finish.",US

2457,US,"Sweet and simple, with flavors of canned peaches and apricots, and a squirt of vanilla.",US
2458,US,"Coming in at the less-oaked end of the California Chardonnay scale, this presents aromas of slate, graphite and cut grass. It delivers those same flavors to the palate as well as some green pear. It's restrained, yet still New World.",US
2459,US,"Acidity, minerals and lower alcohol combine to make Gordon's '08 far superior to the 2007. There's a bracing steeliness to the pineapple and green apple fruit, which is cleansed with racy acidity. The oak is a little strong, but this is a lovely, complex Carneros Chardonnay to drink now.",US
2460,US,"Superbly smooth—satiny is really the right word—this luscious Chardonnay pulls together papaya, banana, pineapple and apricot fruit into a seamless, sensuous, full-bodied whole. There is just enough acid to keep it upright, and lightly applied notes of barrel spice, caramel and toast.",US
2461,US,"From the estate vineyard on the Silverado Trail, this is always one of the better Napa Valley Chardonnay bottlings. The wine is rich in pineapple, pear, green apple and oak flavors, and is a little sweet. But it has brisk acidity and a nice scour of minerality. Drink now.",US
2462,US,"Made in the modern California Chardonnay style you'll either love or hate. It's enormously extracted in pineapple tart, crème brûlée and honey-drizzled buttered toast flavors, and the acidity is bright and clean. The superrichness would benefit from greater control.",US

2470,US,"The challenge with a Chardonnay this big is to wrestle the power into submissive balance. As it is, the wine is overwhelming in buttery new oak and awesomely ripe pineapple and apricot fruit. It's almost undrinkable now. However, there's a brisk streak of acidity, and It's totally dry, with a stony minerality, like a lick of steel. Try cellaring for 3–4 years.",US
2471,US,"The winery's style is a leaner, more minerally and elegant Chardonnay, rather than the blowsy, ripe kind so popular these days. This '09 is quite fine, with brisk acidity and a steely tang to the orange and apricot flavors. Drink over the next three years with shellfish in cream and butter sauces.",US
2472,US,"A bit soft and melted, but offers exotically rich flavors of golden mango, pineapple and cinnamon spice, in a custardy texture.",US
2473,US,"A very dry, minerally wine whose inspiration is Chablis. The profile is lean and clean but complex, with a steely edge to the pineapples and Asian pears. A lovely Chardonnay that will support, not swamp, food.",US
2474,US,"Very Chablis-like, this coastal Chardonnay has high acidity that makes it clean and vibrant. The flavors are marked by minerals and Meyer lemons, with a touch of smoky oak. It's a fine, dry white wine that will pair well with a wide range of foods, and it's from Francis Ford Coppola.",US
2475,US,"Dry and acidic, with sweet and sour Lifesaver pineapple and lemon candy flavors. Made in an easy-to-like style. Production was 4,500 cases, and the alcohol is a modest 13%.",US

2478,US,"Sweet graham cracker abounds, wrapped around a tart, lightly spicy note of apple. It's an interesting combination, a bit unusual, but it works.",US
2479,US,"Sugary and oaky, a simple wine that doesn't do much to promote Livermore Valley. Tastes like sweetened pineapple and pear juice.",US
2480,US,"This is a very dry, acidic wine. It's rather austere, not showing much richness now. With a minerally tang, It's more like a French Chablis than an opulent California Chardonnay. Give it credit for elegance and finesse.",US
2481,US,"Could be a Sauvignon Blanc, with Meyer lemon, green apple and tropical fruit flavors, accented with crisp acidity. That's no disrespect. It's a compliment, in this age of clumsy, overoaked Chardonnays. Elegant and food-friendly, it's brightened with the acidity of a fresh lime.",US
2482,US,"This bottling needs a good vintage to succeed, which it got in 2007. It's dry and crisp, but very rich in tropical fruit, pear, mineral and smoky oak flavors. Easy to find, with 18,000 cases produced.",US
2483,US,"Pure Wente clone from 17-year-old vines, this is cropped down to barely a ton an acre. Flavors are of melon and pear, and the acids keep the wine fresh and lively. The same vineyard produces grapes for Daedalus and Bergström.",US
2484,US,"Very tightly wound in high acidity and even some tannins, with austere, aloof citrus flavors. There's not a lot of appeal to this wine now, except a certain dry, yeasty elegance. It's like a sparkling blanc de blancs without the bubbles.",US
2485,US,"Rich in oaky, fruity flavor, this wine satisfies with pineapples and other citrus fruits, buttered cinnamon toast and vanilla. It's pretty direct, but the price is right for a clean, crisp Chard made in the popular style.",US

2490,US,"More new oak shows here; it's packed with butterscotch and toasted, caramel-coated, apple-flavored fruit. It's tighter, spicier and oakier than the Elerding Vineyard Chardonnay from Januik, though at the moment it seems less complex in the finish.",US
2491,US,"A bit on the soft side, but very delicious, with melted butter, ripe pineapple, lemondrop and cinnamon spice flavors that finish long and dry.",US
2492,US,"Go elsewhere if you're looking for a big, oaky Chardonnay fruit bomb. This one is controlled and elegant, offering tantalizing hints of pineapples, minerals, sweet cream, buttered toast and spices. The acidity is mouthwatering. An elegant, food-friendly wine at a good price.",US

2494,US,"This is the winery's best, small-production Chardonnay. It's considerably better than their regular 2009 Chardonnay. Shows minerality and acidity that make it appealing to the connoisseur, with rich lime and apricot fruit. For all the richness, the finish is dry. Drink now.",France
2495,US,"Young and yeasty, this is a style best consumed early. It refreshes like a light beer, quick and clean, with bracing acidity, but not much in the way of fruit.",US

2498,US,"This barrel-fermented wine reflects the modest ripeness that marked the 2010 vintage. Scents of almond paste, orange peel, citrus, melon and pear intertwine, and the wine's flavors carry light suggestions of them all, along with a touch of caramel. It's drinking well right now, so why wait?",US
2499,US,"This is a soft, broadly fruity Chardonnay, with near-tropical ripeness. Banana and papaya flavors dominate, accented by pretty baking spices and a touch of mineral.",US
2500,US,"This best-of-barrels Chardonnay is oaky, offering waves of butterscotch and buttered toast that dominate the tart underlying flavors of pineapple and lime. It's certainly rich and well-structured, but quite oaky.",US
2501,US,"Leaner and earthier than many Chardonnays, with notes of green and dried herbs alongside the citrus and tropical fruits. Oak plays a modest role. All in all, this discrete wine is best enjoyed now.",US
2502,US,"Fruity and round, with apple and banana flavors, this simple, easy-drinking wine enters and leaves softly all the way.",US
2503,US,"This straightforward wine brings vanilla, citrus and toasted wood to the forefront, with interesting whiffs of petrol as well. It's still tightly wound for a white wine, so waiting until 2016 may reveal more magic.",US
2504,US,"A very nice Chardonnay with plenty of oak character that enriches the dry, ripe tropical fruit and white peach flavors. Likeable now for its clean crispness and elegance.",US
2505,US,"Shows the typicity of this bottling, a fantastically rich, strong Chardonnay, almost overwhelming in late harvest pineapple, apricot, tangerine and créme brûlée flavors. But it's bone dry. These wines age well over a decade, becoming drier in fruit and acquiring roasted nut notes.",US
2506,US,"Shows plenty of finesse in the dry, minerally profile, and the crisp acidity that makes the finish clean and savory. Could be a bit richer, but the pineapple and lemon candy flavors satisfy.",US
2507,US,"A sort of advance peek at the Chardonnay that, in a year or so, will bear the Sleepy Hollow designation. It should be an amazingly rich wine, as even this junior version is. Dry, crisp and oaky, it explodes with pineapple, mango, apricot and buttered toast flavors.",US

2512,US,"The vineyard source is in the cooler part of the valley. The wine is nicely crisp, giving a refreshingly clean mouthfeel that balances the very rich, extracted pineapples, apricots, pears, green apples and peaches. Lots of new oak adds vanilla, butterscotch and sweet cream.",US
2513,US,"Oak and lees mark this Burgundy-style Chardonnay, giving a creamy, smoky, doughy full body that the underlying wine is fully capable of supporting by virtue of the strength and purity of its fruit. It's Chablisian, with mineral-infused lemon and pear flavors.",US
2514,US,"Delicious. Although it's packed with tropical fruit and vanilla honey flavors, the finish is thoroughly dry, and an undergirding of minerals accentuates the crispness. Only 91 cases produced.",US
2515,US,"Custardy and yeasty, with tropical fruit, Meyer lemon and mineral flavors, accented with a strong taste of slightly bitter lees.",US
2516,US,"Lots of tropical fruit, orange, lime, pear and buttered popcorn flavors in this Chardonnay. It's very bright in acidity, and is almost honey-sweet on the finish.",US
2517,US,"Fruit was sourced from the Doc Stewart vineyard, one of the region's oldest, and fermented in American oak.

You will find a lot of flavor for the price, and the wine retains sufficient acidity to brighten up the finish with a lick of minerality.",US
2518,US,"Sweet and sour, with candied pineapple and butterscotch flavors as well as brisk acidity, leading to a sugary finish. Okay as an everyday Chardonnay.",US

2526,US,"Within an immensely heavy bottle lies a Chardonnay dark-golden in color and with barrel-fermentation written all over its body, which is hearty and nonlinear. The flavors tend toward coconut, pineapple and dried apple, concentrated and extracted in a big California way.",US
2527,US,"Clean and stylish, this sleek Chardonnay includes a few new barrels and some new stave wood. It's about 60% stainless-steel and 40% barrel fermented. This is a very nice compromise between barrel fermented, oaky flavors and the too-neutral character of all-stainless Chardonnay. There's a lemony lift to the aromas, and delicate hints of toast dappled throughout, but it's really the crisp apple and pear fruit that shines through.",US
2528,US,"Made in an elaborately flamboyant style, this Chard is enormously ripe with pineapple-infused crème brûlée, peach custard, toasted meringue and cinnamon flavors. Delicious, but could be crisper.",US

2532,US,"The coolness of the region and vintage shows in this Chard's acidic crispness and minerality. It comes down on the Chablis-style end of the spectrum, with hints of tropical fruits, apples and pears, as well as a welcome touch of sweet oak. Easily Silverado's best Chardonnay in years.",US

2537,US,"Great price for a big production (5,000 cases) Chardonnay of this quality. It's dry and crisp and elegantly structured, with savory citrus fruit, peach, mineral and vanilla flavors. Easily as good as many Chards far more costly. From Don Sebastiani & Sons.",US
2538,US,"A very nice, sleek Chardonnay that shows you don't have to pay a high price for a good wine. Fermented in stainless steel, it received brief exposure to oak in the form of staves. The wine is bone dry and earthy, with rich flavors of pineapples, herbs, buttercream and cinnamon spice.",US
2539,US,"Shows distinct cool-climate acidity framing streamlined flavors of pineapples, lemons and limes, minerals and spices. It's an elegantly structured, clean wine that will satisfy Chardonnay lovers.",US
2540,US,"Tart green apple fruit flavors dominate, with high acids and perhaps a hint of light toast. Simple and straightforward.",US
2541,US,"Savory on the nose and palate with notes of cooked apples, pears and spice, Silver Thread's Chardonnay is subdued in style but easy going for everyday enjoyment. A dry, medium bodied wine with a squirt of lemony acidity that brightens the mid-palate.",US
2542,US,"Aged in French oak, there's some captivating smoke, toast and butterscotch aromas on this medium-bodied Chard. The palate is on the leaner side without a lot of persistence or depth, but it's an elegant wine for everyday.",US
2543,US,"Simple, with slightly sweet aromas and flavors of buttered toast, popcorn and butterscotch Lifesaver candy drops. A disappointment for a bottling that's been far better in the past.",US
2544,US,"Clean, lean and elegant, with mineral-infused citrus and green apple flavors set off by crisp acidity. There's no oak, but somehow the wine has a vanilla and honey richness.",US
2545,US,"Very dry, tartly acidic and lemony, almost like a Sauvignon Blanc, but with richer notes of pineapple cream. Super-drinkable, and the low alcohol won't overpower a delicate dish, like sole in a garlicky butter sauce.",US
2546,US,"A bit soft and direct, but appeals for its rich flavors of pineapples, buttered toast, cinnamon and smoke. Shows a firm minerality at its core. Drink now.",US
2547,US,"There's beautiful fruit from a beautiful vineyard in here somewhere but first let there be oak, lots of it (100% new French), giving the wine a dark golden hue and the nose an interesting meaty, baked apple quality. Taste-wise the wine is almost savory and leathery, full of ripe, exotic fruit, hugely creamy with a smackdown finish. Not for the meek but with time could get quite lovely.",US
2548,US,"Made in the modern style of oaky softness and jammy ripe fruit. Shows appealing pineapple, pear, buttered toast and vanilla cream flavors, with just enough acidity for balance.",US
2549,US,"Made in a food-friendly fashion, this Chard is dry, acidic and minerally. It was obviously picked at lower ripeness, but still shows a warm core of pineapples and green apples. Quite a nice wine for Chardonnay fans to drink with roasted chicken, fleshy fish, or even a white meat such as pork.",US
2550,US,"A very rich, ripe, oaky Chardonnay. Made in an appealing style, with likeable pineapple jam, golden mango, buttered toast and spice flavors. It's an opulent wine to drink now.",US
2551,US,"Gets the job done with modest tangerine, pineapple and cream flavors. Nice and crisp and dry, but it's pretty thin.",US
2552,US,"Curiously perfumed with notes of roasted hazelnuts and fresh apples, this is a savory, dry Chardonnay. Full bodied in style with notes of nut oil and nut skins throughout, it ends with a hint of wood sap astringency on the finish.",US
2553,US,"This has a soapy mouthfeel, often an indicator for a high pH wine. The apple and pear fruit flavors are mild but thin.",US
2554,US,"Apples, peaches and pears are evident in this surprisingly full, almost fleshy Chardonnay. A portion was barrel-fermented, and the flavors of toast and tobacco are relatively moderate and well-integrated. The wine has some sweetness along with the crisp fruit, but without the exaggerated vanilla flavors of many cheap Chardonnays. This is the best from Hogue in a long while.",US
2555,US,"Showing crisp, lemony acidity, this unoaked Chardonnay brims with citrus, gooseberry, pear and vanilla flavors. A fine example of the stainless steel style.",US
2556,US,"Presents with equal parts crisp acidity, buttered toast new oak and ripe pineapple and kumquat fruit. The result is big and flashy, but a little Frankensteinian.",US
2557,US,"Rich flavors of peaches, pears, buttercream and toast appear in this dry Chardonnay, which shows no signs of tiredness, although many 2007s do. The chief problem is excessive softness. It lacks balancing acidity and brightness.",US
2558,US,"A big, bold, bright and spicy Chardonnay. You'll hardly miss the presence of oak, it's so rich in fruit. Floods the mouth with oranges, pineapples, lemons, limes and minerals, with crisp acidity.",US
2559,US,"Nothing charming about this wine, which is sweet, acidic and fruity, like a Lifesaver pineapple and lemon candy. Pretty expensive for what you get.",US
2560,US,"There's a sour twinge on the nose that's reminiscent of sweet apple cider vinegar, but the dry, medium bodied palate is pleasant with fresh apple juice flavors and a touch of cream on the finish.",US
2561,US,"Shows a welcome return to form, with lush, oak-inspired flavors of grilled pineapples, apricots and mulled green apple cider. This is a very good price for a Chardonnay of this quality.",US
2562,US,"Though not quite as concentrated as the ripe, super-saturated 2005 Chardonnay, this has a similar mix of tropical and stone fruits, wrapped in thick, buttery, oaky barrel flavors. It's soft and round, already quite evolved, but helped out by the higher acids of the vintage.",US
2563,US,"Soft and smoky, with ripe flavors of pineapple tart, sweet lemon custard, vanilla and cinnamon. Pretty and polished, an easy wine to like.",US
2564,US,"This Demeter-certified Biodynamic Chardonnay has nice color and full apple aromas, as well as a lot of depth and texture. The finish veers into caramel and vanilla, no stranger to oak.",US
2565,US,"A little harsh and rugged around the edges, but shows good Chardonnay character. Peaches and cream, pineapple fruit and buttered toast flavors lead to a clean finish.",US

2570,US,"Savory, cooked apples spiked with apple cider vinegar mark the nose and palate of this simple, homespun Chardonnay.",US
2571,US,"Not much going on in this inexpensive wine. It's watery, with a sugary, soda pop sweet finish.",US
2572,US,"Firm and minerally, with green apple butter, pineapple tart and highly charred oak flavors that finish with a caramelized, slightly burnt aftertaste. Drink now.",US
2573,US,"Good price for a clean, briskly acidic Chardonnay of such elegance and balance. Far from a fruit bomb, its pineapple, lime and guava flavors are evened out by minerals and slightly sour lees, and the oak has been minimally applied.",US
2574,US,"Oak dominates this Chardonnay, with buttered toast and butterscotch flavors. Underneath is a ripe wine, with pineapple and tangerine fruit, brightened with crisp acidity. Made in the popular style and pretty good, but the oak is a little too much.",US
2575,US,"Lots of crisp, crunchy acidity in this Chardonnay, with distinct flavors of pineapples. Oak adds vanilla and buttered toast. Rich and elaborate, although lacking complexity. Drink now.",US
2576,US,"A fine Chardonnay for the price. Soft and buttery upon entry, it shows good balance in the midpalate, with the butter blended with fresh apple and lime, and set against enough juicy acidity to give it definition.",US
2577,US,"For eight bucks you get a rich, creamy taste of pineapples, green apples and cinnamon spice. Not quite sweet, not quite dry, but balanced with crisp acidity. A bargain.",US
2578,US,"Here's a good but rather generic California Chardonnay. It shows well-ripened flavors of pineapple jam and pears, balanced with firm coastal acidity and rich layers of smoky, caramelized oak. Drink now.",US
2579,US,"A little sharp and harsh in acidity, but the pineapple jam, pear and smoky vanilla flavors are okay. Finishes dry and spicy.",US
2580,US,"While this Chardonnay was aged in only 17% new French oak barrels, the oak really dominates, bearing aromas and flavors of buttered toast and butterscotch.

2583,US,"This $13 wine is quite fine, deep in color with a rich, flinty nose. It's big and full with drops of honey throughout and a layer of acidity on the finish. Modest in alcohol too.",US
2584,US,"This unoaked Chardonnay offers aromas and flavors of apples and almonds and a crisp, fresh structure. Elegant but easy drinking, it will pair well with seafood, poultry and lighter cheeses.",US
2585,US,"A to Z is on the money once again with this screwcapped Chardonnay, tight but flavorful with mixed tree fruits and more exotic notes of quince and kiwi. Not as outgoing as the 2006, this will reward chilling and a little bit of breathing time, but it's a fair value and a good quaff.",US
2586,US,"Crisp acidity marks this dry Chardonnay, with forward flavors of pineapples, pears and papaya, grounded with a pleasant minerality and enriched with vanilla oak. It's a wine to drink now.",US
2587,US,"Very oaky right off the bat, with unintegrated aromas of fresh-cut wood. The green apple flavors are tart and highly acidic, while the oak integration has barely begun. It's big, acidic, clean and oaky, but offers little in the way of depth or pleasure.",US
2588,US,"Clean and fresh, this value-priced southern Oregon Chardonnay offers balanced, elegant flavors of flower and fruit. Notes of apple and pear are front and center, with hints of white peach and cinnamon.",US
2589,US,"An extraordinary Chardonnay whose complicated richness is balanced with tight acidity and a firm grounding of stony minerals. Brings to mind a great Chablis, with its zesty tang followed by elaborate layers of tropical fruits and pears. Utterly delicious, wildly appealing, a wine that will develop bottle interest over the next six years. Only 97 cases were produced.",US
2590,US,"Chardonnay doesn't get much riper or richer than this. Dazzles with pear jam, pineapple custard, crème brûlée, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors, and a firm grounding of minerals. Calls for the richest possible foods, like lobster. Drink now.",US
2591,US,"The best thing about this Chardonnay is the acidity. It's brisk and clean, and gives a zesty finish to the extraordinarily rich pineapple, papaya, lime and Meyer lemon flavors that are almost sweet, but aren't. A firm scour of minerals adds the necessary grounding to this complex wine. Drink now–2013, but not too cold.",US
2592,US,"Silhouette is Merryvale's small-production best of barrels blend from the winery's various vineyards. The '08 is a success, showing brisk acidity and new oak and yeast flavors and a creamy texture framing ripe pineapple, pear and mineral flavors. It's an elegant wine that shouldn't be served too cold.",US
2593,US,"This is the estate bottling, barrel-fermented in French oak and put through full malolactic. Spice and toast frame perfectly ripened tree fruit flavors of apple, pear and orange peel. The concentration and length suggest that this Chardonnay can be cellared for up to a decade.",US
2594,US,"Though not at all unsung (in fact, mailing list is closed), Abeja wines offer exceptional quality for the price across the entire lineup. Case in point: this super-long, ultradelicious Chardonnay, a generous wine with green apple, lime and white peach; add in notes of butter, brioche and baking spices. The length and balance, along with the pure pleasure, far exceed the price.",US
2595,US,"Quite a good wine, but the powerful oak is a bit intrusive at this time. It swamps the mouth with caramel and crème brûlée. Below all that seems to be a fine, pineapple-flavored Chardonnay. Everything may knit together in a year or so.",US
2596,US,"The high acidity on this Chard makes your mouth water. It's not a lush, opulent wine, but it is complex, with green apple, lime zest and mineral flavors enriched with oak and lees. Elegant and well-structured. Drink now.",US
2597,US,"A very rich Chardonnay, explosive in lemon custard, grilled pineapple and the ripest peaches imaginable. At the same time, there's a firm, tangy minerality. Some will find, however, that the oak dominates it all with a blast of buttered toast and caramel.",US
2598,US,"Simple and honey sweet, with pineapple and buttered toast flavors. Gets the job done.",US
2599,US,"A good, rich Chardonnay that satisfies fans of oaky, ripe bottlings. Brims with pineapple, peach, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors, brightened with crisp acidity.",US

2601,US,"Oaky and fruity, with simple, direct flavors of pineapple juice, butterscotch, caramel candy and cinnamon.",US
2602,US,"New oak accounts for 30% of the barrels used, yet it really dominates, with a buttered toast aroma and flavor. The malolactic fermentation brings notes of buttered popcorn, while the underlying notes of pineapples, Meyer lemons and limes are rich and ripe.",US
2603,US,"Gainey's basic Santa Rita Chardonnay is a fine wine, dry, crisp and minerally, and this is a good price for it. It shows a nice mélange of oak influences with peach, pear and pineapple fruit flavors.",US
2604,US,"A few years in the bottle are beginning to age this charming Chardonnay, although its brisk acidity and minerality remain. The pear, guava, nectarine and tangerine flavors are just starting to pick up a dried fruit character. Complex and savory, it's a very fine wine to drink now.",US
2605,US,"A beautiful Chardonnay, notable for its elegant structure. Perfect acidity and just a hint of tannins, much of it from oak barrels, provide the framework for the pineapple and kiwi fruit flavors, enriched with notes of cream and buttered toast.",US
2606,US,"A brilliant Chardonnay showing how well this region can ripen fruit while retaining brisk acidity. Oak barrels add an exotic touch of clove to the underlying pineapple fruit flavors. Feels rich and creamy, and aging on the lees provides a complex touch of sourdough. Drink now.",US
2607,US,"A number of different fermentation regimens puts these grapes through their paces, and leads to skillful blending. The result is a wine of exceptional complexity, depth and texture. Lively citrus, Meyer lemon, tangerine, peach and caramel flavors abound.",US
2608,US,"It's easy for a California Chardonnay to be rich, but few can rise to the level of balanced complexity as this gorgeous bottling. The wine is enormous in apricot, orange, nectarine, pear and Meyer lemon fruit, with the vanilla and buttered toast of French oak. The acidity is just about perfect.",US
2609,US,"This is a classic Russian River and Williams Selyem Chardonnay, so bright in acidity and rich in fruit, you hardly notice the oak. Papayas, tangerines, peaches, pears, Meyer lemons and minerals mingle perfectly with vanilla, buttered toast and acidity, producing a wine of elegance and creamy flair. Drink it now, but not too cold.",US
2610,US,"Sweet in jammy apricot and tangerine fruit, with lots of sweet caramel, honey and buttered toast flavors from oak, this Chardonnay is a good example of the modern style of ripeness.",US
2611,US,"Rich and extracted, with pineapple tart filling, butterscotch, caramel and smoky flavors. Feels a bit soft, and the oak sticks out.",US
2612,US,"Here's a bone-dry, crisp, minerally Chardonnay that will be great with shellfish. It has subtle flavors of limes, Meyer lemons and figs. Very clean and refreshing.",US
2613,US,"A bit heavy-handed in the high alcohol that gives a touch of heat, which in turn accentuates the oak. Soft, too. The tropical fruit flavors are opulent, but the wine needs greater structural balance.",US
2614,US,"A clean aroma of apple that's detailed with light notes of fresh herb and barrel toast introduce this well-structured Chardonnay. It's a solid effort, buoyed by good natural acidity.",US

2616,US,"Flowery and sweet, with apricot, buttercup and banana flavors in a soft texture.",US
2617,US,"The best Alexander Valley Chardonnays, such as this, show flamboyant tropical flavors.

The oak appliqué is just about perfect.",US
2618,US,"A rich Chardonnay made in the popular style. It's almost sweet in pineapple jam, crème brûlée, buttered toast, honey and cinnamon spice flavors, while that bright Carneros acidity keeps it clean and lively.",US
2619,US,"This fancy, opulent Chardonnay is made in a certain Santa Rita style of high alcohol, which makes it enormously rich. It oozes pineapple, pear and lime jam fruit, while new oak adds buttered toast flavors and the glycerine from 15.5% alcohol makes the wine even creamier and sweeter. This is an inaugural vintage from the winery.",US
2620,US,"A very nice Chardonnay at a friendly price. It shows familiar peaches-and-cream and buttered toast flavors, with a dry, clean finish. Easy to find, with 3,500 cases produced.",US
2621,US,"Unique and distinctive, this unusual effort mixes ripe, lightly peachy fruit with aggressively smoky barrel notes. It's a difficult wine to score ; although this is not a technically perfect bottle, it delivers a lot of flavor—if you really like smoke.",US
2622,US,"Ripe and juicy, this bears orange, lime and tropical fruit flavors. It's dry, but so fruity that it almost seems sweet. The acidity is strong and the alcohol is refreshingly modest.",US

2625,US,"Complex and well-crafted, especially at this price point. Two thirds was barrel fermented, one third in tank; there is also about one quarter new oak and one quarter put through malolactic. The result is an affordable Chardonnay with real style and complexity. Tropical fruit, some toast and texture, good persistence and the right balancing acid.",US
2626,US,"Many wineries have dipped into this Petaluma Gap-grown vineyard for grapes, and now MacPhail does. The wine shows the cool-climate crispness of the region, with zesty acidity. It's bone dry and minerally, a Chablis-style Chardonnay with tangerine fruit and some new oak sweetness.",US
2627,US,"Just when this Chard seems simple and sweet, the fruit is overtaken by acidity and minerality, taking the tangerine, lime and mango flavors to the next level and making the wine complex and fascinating. Shows how exceptional winemaking can result in exceptional wine.",France
2628,US,"Some Chardonnays with this much oak and lees influence lose all sense of terroir, but not this one. Somehow, vintner Bill Cooper has allowed the fruit to express itself, showing up as minerals, papayas and apricots. It's balanced and compelling. The price makes it a bargain.",US
2629,US,A lighter-style Chardonnay with lemony zest and the minerality of a Sauvignon Blanc that's perfectly quaffable and a very fair price.,US
2630,US,"With pineapple, green apple and lime flavors brightened by crisp acidity, this Chardonnay is totally dry, although it picks up some sweetness from oak barrels. It's not very complex. But it is clean and elegant.",US

2640,US,"What's so nice about this Chardonnay is the way the dryness, acidity and minerality combine with tropical fruit to make for a splendid, Chablis-style California wine.

2642,US,"Sadly, it's the last vintage for this single-vineyard Chardonnay. It captures the subtle blend of yellow and green berries and apples, with superior length and detail.

2643,US,"Ripe, fruity and oaky, in the modern style, this Chard shows vanilla and butterscotch-tinged flavors of candied pineapples and honey.",US
2644,US,"Very ripe and oaky, what this wine may lack in subtlety it makes up for in sheer power. Bursts with ripe, candied pineapple and lemon honey flavors that finish sweet.",US
2645,US,"Much like the 2005 Hogue Reserve, this is a deep gold and fragrant with candied pineapple, buttered nuts and toast. It's big and rich and forward, but also a bit clunky and one dimensional, without the subtlety to offset the oak. Feels just a bit oxidized, as if aging rather quickly.",US
2646,US,"This full-bodied Chardonnay begins with aromas of vanilla toast, herbs and cream, followed by toasty spice and fruit flavors. The finish is lingering and curvy. Not terribly complex, but a good cohort to lobster, crab and creamy pasta dishes.",US

Cool coastal acidity provides a clean, tart balance. This is a delicious, upscale Chardonnay.",US
2651,US,"Stillwater and Conner Lee vineyard grapes go into this fresh and spicy Chardonnay, detailed with herb and spice and cucumber flavors. An interesting take on Washington Chardonnay, with unusual complexity and length. The spicy notes extend beautifully; though known primarily as a red wine producer, Mark Ryan has an especially good feel for white wines.",US
2652,US,"Concentrated with a mix of toasted almonds, pineapple and candied peach fruit flavors; a thoroughly delicious and deeply seductive wine. The finish just goes on and on, with flavors that are complex and layered, the crisp fruit, wet stone and citrus rind components beautifully defined and matched. This is what Washington Chardonnay should be, but rarely is.",US

2655,US,"This full-bodied blend of grapes from a wide assortment of top vineyards shows fine acidity, a good phenolic frame of citrus rind, and core flavors of lemon and grapefruit, green apple and white peach.

2656,US,"Sweet, smoky oak dominates this Chard, giving a caramelized, vanilla custard taste to the underlying pineapple fruit. Fans of this style will enjoy it.",US
2657,US,"Ceago's Reserve seems a little top-heavy in oak. The caramel and woodsap coating smothers the underlying wine, which is very fine, to judge by the winery's '07 unoaked Chard.",France
2658,US,"Tastes like Chardonnay with bubbles and yeast. With a slightly sweet finish, this bubbly has flavors of limes, green apples and lees.",US
2659,US,"This Chiles Valley producer, on the eastern edge of the Napa Valley, has made a big Chardonnay that doesn't exude much aromatically at first and veers sweet, but is otherwise balanced and could develop some interesting minerality over time.",US
2660,US,"Impressive, but too sweet for comfort, despite great streamlining acidity that keeps the finish clean. Tastes like sugared orange tea and pineapple jam, with the buttered toast and caramel of oak. Earns extra points for minerality and structure.",US
2661,US,"A little soft and direct, with jammy, pie-filling flavors of pineapples, tangerines, pears and apricots. Drink now.",US
2662,US,"Nice and crisp, with rich flavors of apricots, pineapples and pears, accented with smoky oak and a scour of coastal acidity. But finishes a little too sugary sweet.",US

2671,US,"Citrus and honeydew fruit flavors anchor this unoaked Chardonnay. It has a wonderful leesy texture that enlivens the palate, giving the impression of limestone, or at least lime pulp. Flavors linger, clean and utterly refreshing.",US
2672,US,"Marked by zesty acidity and dryness, this Chard shows long hangtime, ripe flavors of pineapples, lemons and sweet green apples. Minerality grounds the fruit, making the wine savory and clean. Gets better as it warms in the glass, a very good sign.",US

2676,US,"Now part of the Ascentia portfolio, Columbia seems to be righting itself. This fresh and creamy Chardonnay will do nicely with a wide variety of pastas and poultry dishes. The fruit is a lacy mix of stone fruits and light tropical; with a streak of vanilla running through the finish.",US
2677,US,"Chard freaks will love this California-style version of the variety. It's wonderfully fruity, with ripe pineapples, tangerines and papayas, and a rich, sweet taste, like bananas sautéed in butter and drizzled with honey. The acidity is perfect. Great job for the price, and easy to find, with production of 12,700 cases.",US
2678,US,"Oddly, the Genesis bottling seems flatter, duller and overall less focused than the winery's excellent Columbia Valley Chardonnay. It just doesn't hold together in the middle, and fades quickly into some cardboardy notes.",US
2679,US,"Lots of rich, ripe flavor in this sweet young Chardonnay. It's packed with citrus and tropical fruits, limes and pears. The influence of lees shows in a slight sourness throughout. Drink now.",US
2680,US,"Good and easy to like, but too oaky by half, with smoky char flavors dominating. Underneath that is a crisply dry, minerally Chardonnay, with fine orange and Meyer lemon flavors. It would be nice to try this as an unoaked wine.",US
2681,US,"A somewhat standard Chardonnay, ripe in green apples, tropical and citrus fruits and honey, with the requisite jacket of toasty oak. Shows a refreshing acidity.",US
2682,US,"Toasty and honeyed in scent, this has aromas of glazed apples and pears, butterscotch and an edge of Meyer lemon zest. Medium to full bodied, the palate is vibrant and expressive, with the lemon note carrying the finish.",US
2683,US,"A very nice Chardonnay that offers enough richness to justify the price, yet retains an elegant restraint that won't overpower food. Dry, creamy and brisk, it shows pineapple tart, ripe white peach, buttered toast and vanilla flavors, with a mouthwatering minerality. Production was 800 cases.",US
2684,US,"Oaky and strong in jammy fruit, this Chardonnay has potent pineapple, tropical fruit and buttered caramel popcorn flavors. It's also quite acidic. Would benefit from greater control and nuance.",US
2685,US,"There's a fruit juice quality to this Chard, like an apricot, peach and pineapple blend you buy in the supermarket. It has refreshing acidity and a clean finish.",US
2686,US,"This wine shows plenty of Chardonnay and oak character, with a creamy core of honey, peaches and toast. It will go with a wide variety of fare, from halibut and grilled tuna to broiled chicken and mushroom risotto.",US
2687,US,"Barrel-fermented and aged sur lie for 10 months, this elegant Chardonnay offers immaculate scents and flavors of lemon rind and pith, a dusting of spice, and a generous slice of ripe apple. It's full and luscious in the mouth, with appealing texture, barrel toast and just a pat of butter in the finish.",US
2688,US,"Up there in the Chalone hills they have a lot of limestone, and you can taste the flint and chalk in this wine even through the lavish tropical fruit and spice. It's a really interesting Chardonnay that's quite fancy and elegantly structured, and it will hold for a good six years.",US
2689,US,"Dry Creek Vineyard turns to the cooler Russian River Valley to source this deliciously crisp Chardonnay. It has spicy flavors of baked green apples, pineapple jam, butterscotch, vanilla and wonderfully exotic figs. Low alcohol gives it perfect balance.",US
2690,US,"A brilliant Chardonnay, easily deserving its Reserve status. Crisp and dry, it houses opulent flavors of ripe tropical fruits, butterscotch, roasted hazelnuts, crème brûlée and cinnamon spice.",US
2691,US,"A very pleasant Chardonnay that's lifted above the ordinary by a brisk, dry minerality. Orange, lemon and pear fruit stars, with a suggestion of toast and complicated notes of anise, vanilla and cream.",US
2692,US,"A good, rich Chardonnay, showing fine acidity and plenty of ripe pineapple, Asian pear, lime and green apple flavors, with a rich coating of sweet, caramelized oak.",US
2693,US,"Here's a big, rich, ripe and oaky Chardonnay that will appeal to fans of sheer power. It's potent in pineapple jam and vanilla caramel flavors, with bright acidity. Impressive, but could use greater subtlety and complexity.",US
2694,US,"A disappointment from this esteemed vineyard, but consistent with Falcor's past record. The wine is thinly flavored and overly oaked, leaving an impression of woody, spicy citrus fruits.",US
2695,US,"A bit soft and dull, with oak-infused flavors of citrus fruits and peaches that show some bitterness on the finish.",US
2696,US,"A little too sugary sweet, but balanced with crisp acidity. The flavors are of jammy pineapples, tangerines and vanilla custard.",US
2697,US,"Very pale and spritzy, this unoaked Chardonnay brings lightweight melon and green pineapple fruit flavors, but not much else. The bubbles can't compensate for the weightless midpalate.",US
2698,US,"A nice Chardonnay to drink now, with rich tropical fruit, apple and pear flavors, enhanced with vanilla and smoky oak. One of the more successful Silverado Chardonnays of recent years.",US
2699,US,"Sweet and extracted in pineapple, tangerine, lime and vanilla flavors, this Chardonnay also is generously oaked, which gives it even richer vanilla and buttered toast notes. It's flashy, yet would benefit from greater dryness and restraint. Size isn't everything.",US
2700,US,"The oak barrel influence comes across quite strong in this Chardonnay. The wine itself, made from fruit sourced from this mountain appellation in the central part of Sonoma County, is rich in tropical fruit and pear flavors, with zesty acidity.",US
2701,US,"The expressive nose on this full-bodied white evokes pear and apple, while flavors of butter, vanilla and apple unfold on the palate. Good for fans of rounder Chardonnays. Pair with crab, lobster or poultry dishes with cream sauces.",US
2702,US,"Smells and tastes a bit funky, with a sweaty note to the buttered toast, grilled pineapple and cinnamon flavors. Feels kind of soft and flabby. Decant before serving.",US
2703,US,"Passes muster for its tropical fruit and vanilla cream flavors. Turns a little cloying and sweet on the finish, though.",US
2704,US,"This comes from a one-acre block of Dijon 75 clone Chardonnay; whole-cluster pressed and barrel fermented. Succulent is the word that keeps cropping up as it rollicks across the palate; it's juicy and loaded with a mix of apple, pear and light tropical fruit, especially pineapple. Bright and tangy, this nicely spiced wine continues the consistent quality streak for this winery's Chardonnays, and finishes with a lingering kiss of toast and cinnamon.",US
2705,US,"This is the kind of Chardonnay that divides wine lovers into enemy camps. Old World purists will criticize the candied richness. New World fans will love the toasted marshmallow, caramel corn and buttered toast flavors that rest on a solid foundation of pineapple and green apple fruit.",US
2706,US,"Marked by big, sharp acidity, like biting into a lime, and clean, linear flavors of limes, green apples and pineapples, this bone-dry Chardonnay badly needs food to balance it out. Think of bacon-wrapped grilled shrimp, or a spicy Ahi tuna tartare dish.",US
2707,US,"Rich and oaky, with brisk acidity framing delicious flavors of pineapple custard, buttered toast and crème brûlée. Elegant and impressive for drinking now.",US
2708,US,"A clean, crisp Chardonnay, rich in pineapple, green apple, peach and mineral flavors. Shows some real elegance, with its acidity and dry, Chablis-style finish.",US
2709,US,"Bright, brisk acidity saves the day with this Chardonnay, giving it a zesty crunch and making the pineapple, orange and oak flavors, which are pretty sweet, taste drier than they really are. An easy-drinking Chard at a fair price.",US
2710,US,"Oaky, ripe and sweet, this Chard has candied flavors of pineapples, vanilla and honey.",US
2711,US,"Way too oaky. Compromised by the clumsy, heavy application of wood. The caramel and roasted butterscotch aromas and flavors completely swamp whatever wine lies beneath.",US
2712,US,"This shows jelly-like flavors of orange and pear, with some earthy tones. The mouthfeel is soft and there's a bounty of oak in the form of buttered toast and caramel notes.",US
2713,US,"A Chardonnay of heightened acidity, this is fresh, light and banced, with tastes of lemon and pear.",US
2714,US,"Simple and direct, this tastes like blend of apricots, pears and mangos, with a gentle oak touch. It has pleasant acidity and nice warmth from the alcohol. Drink now.",US
2715,US,"The oak is a bit heavy-handed in its buttered toast and caramel flavors. Underneath that veneer is a perfectly nice Chardonnay that has clean, tart citrus, pear and green apple flavors.",US
2716,US,"A good everyday Chardonnay, with sweet, jammy flavors of pineapples, apricots, tangerines, vanilla and cinnamon. Finishes creamy and dry.",US
2717,US,"Oaky, with butterscotch, vanilla cream and caramel flavors that swamp the underlying pineapple and pear fruit. If you're a fan of super-oaked Chardonnays, it's for you.",US
2718,US,"Although there's a lot of oak on this wine, it's not heavy or fat in the excessive California style, because the underlying wine is so crisp and elegant. Call it Chablisian. It shows mineral, Meyer lemon and lime flavors, with brilliant acidity. Really quite a fine Carneros Chardonnay.",US
2719,US,"Simple, sweet and cloying, with sugary flavors of pineapples, peaches and pears.",US
2720,US,"Tart and slender, this is deceptive; at first it seems a little thin, but as it opens in the glass into a succulent, well-defined, racy wine with citrus and peach, mineral and herb. It's not delicate, but its muscularity is concealed behind elegant styling.",US
2721,US,"Believe me, you won't miss the oak barrel influence on this wine. It's so good all by itself. Brightened with crisp Monterey acidity and totally dry, it's rich in pineapple, tangerine, Meyer lemon, lime, mineral and vanilla flavors that will satisfy your Chardonnay tooth.",US
2722,US,"With no oak added, this wine offers only itself. It's ripe and fruity in pineapples, limes and tangerines, with crisp Edna Valley acidity. Likeable for its clean, brisk profile.",US
2723,US,"With brisk Edna Valley acidity and intensely pure Chardonnay fruit flavors of tangerines, limes and sweet Meyer lemon sour candy, this is a pleasant sipper with roasted or grilled salmon, or a barbecue chicken or pork skewer with pineapples, green peppers and onions.",US
2724,US,"The winery's reserve Chard has consistently been the best among their five Chards. The '05 is a dramatic wine, although oak-o-phobes might find it toothpicky. It is smoky and buttery and caramelly, but a year or so should knit that together with the ripe tropical fruits and make the wine seamlessly complex.",US
2725,US,"A step up from Jefferson's regular bottling, this offers medium-intense aromas of white orchard fruit, wet wool and mineral, plus a subtle nuttiness. Light to medium bodied, it has a zesty midpalate, with flavors that mirror the nose.",US
2726,US,"Creamy and buttery, this Chardonnay provides satisfying vanilla and tropical fruit flavors that finish on a honeyed note.",US
2727,US,"Shows the weight, complexity and sheer deliciousness that this bottling almost always displays. Chardonnay fans will love the oaky, creamy flavors of pineapple tart, pear and lemon jam and buttered toast. The winemaker recommends pairing with black cod, and if you have a Chinese restaurant that makes a good version of this honey and soy inspired dish, it will be heaven.",US
2728,US,"This is a lovely Chardonnay, a super restaurant wine list bottle. Dry and creamy, it offers pleasantly rich pineapple, lime pie, green apple, exotic spice and buttered toast flavors, accented with crisp, clean acidity.",US
2729,US,"Good price, but a little too soft and sweet for a dry table wine. Shows sugary, pie-filling flavors of pineapples, with lots of vanilla-oak influence.",US
2730,US,"This is a solid, everyday Chard. It's very dry and crisp, with earthy, fruity citrus flavors. The acidity may be a little too high for some people.",US
2731,US,"This is a fancy Chardonnay. It impresses for the ripe tropical fruit and citrus flavors that are generously oaked, and for the crisp coastal acidity that provides balance. The overall impression is of pineapple-infused crème brûlée. Drink now.",US
2732,US,"Searing acidity marks this wine, which tastes like it has a lot of Edna Valley fruit in the blend. It also shows bright, strong, long hangtime flavors of limes and pineapples. It's actually quite a fine Chardonnay, dry and low in alcohol. A great value at this price.",US
2733,US,"This is a very rich Chardonnay, almost too elaborated and overworked. It's tremendous in oak-infused fruit, with dominating buttered toast, crème brûlée and pineapple pie flavors. Very crisp coastal acidity provides a pleasant balance of tartness. Drink now.",US
2734,US,"Opening scents of cracker and Asian pear roll into a concentrated, sophisticated effort that was half barrel-fermented. Tart citrus, apple and pear fruit is touched lightly with pretty spice.",US
2735,US,"This mid-level Chardonnay from Columbia Crest has a broad fan base, and is a popular by-the-glass pour. It is soft and plush, the fruit seems to float on a bed of puffy toast. Buttered apples, pastry and a finishing smack of green apple acidity leave you wanting the next sip.",US
2736,US,"Delicious scents of nuts, toast and honey-kissed apples, pears and lemon waft from this lovely Chardonnay from Sherwood House. Dry and full bodied, it balances an intensely fruity palate with an elegant minerality and some brisk pineapple acidity.",US
2737,US,"Rich doesn't begin to describe this Chard. It's humongous in pie-filling and grilled peaches, pears, pineapples and papayas, while 50% new oak adds all sorts of buttercream, crème brûlée and smoked butter layers. Yet the wine shows a minerality that grounds and balances it. Very fancy stuff, and should age for up to six years.",US
2738,US,"This is weighty, creamy and medium to full in body. It has plenty of lime and pear flavors, plus slight brown sugar and vanilla notes.",US
2739,US,"One dimensional and clean, this has brisk acidity and a creamy mouthfeel, with pineapple, orange, lime and mineral flavors.",US
2740,US,"Flavors of ripe tropical fruit, orange and smoky, sweet oak influence this slightly sweet Chardonnay. It's made in the popular style, with brisk Russian River acidity that provides mouthwatering balance.",US
2741,US,"This smells like a warm spiced-apple muffin. On the palate, the apple-like vibe continues, melding with a lemon accent. The acids are bright and keep the wine feeling lifted through the minerally finish.",US
2742,US,"Oak is the strongest element in this Chardonnay, providing dominant buttered toast, butterscotch and caramel aromas and flavors. The wine also has great acidity and ripe flavors of green apple, pear and kiwi.",US
2743,US,"Oaky but simple, with smoky, caramel flavors covering thin notes of pineapple sour candy.",US
2744,US,"Sweet in caramelized oak, this Chard also has jammy flavors of pears and apricots.",US
2745,US,"This valley in Santa Barbara County continues to prove its relevance to California Chardonnay, as proven once again by this dry, crisply elegant and decadently delicious wine. It bursts in the mouth with juicy pineapple, white peach and honeysuckle flavors, generously oaked, but is balanced in acidity and minerals.",US
2746,US,"Drier and more minerally than Foxen's other Chardonnays, because it is the least oaked. It's vibrant in grilled pineapple, mango, apricot and vanilla spice flavors, brightened by beautiful acidity. Alcohol is quite high, but the wine never tastes hot or unbalanced.",US
2747,US,"This impressive Chardonnay from a small Livermore Valley producer is on the austere side of Chardonnay, with notes of just-ripe pear, tiny hints of wet stone, a nice, nutty finish and enough body to go with a wealth of foods. Good balance too.",US
2748,US,"Horse & Plow sourced organic grapes to craft this excellent Chardonnay, giving it the luxe treatment—handpicked, whole-cluster pressed, French oak barrel fermentation and aging nine months sur lee—and it shows. The wine is pretty, with a tropical bouquet that gives way to just enough oak-driven vanilla. Will age nicely but is also ready to drink now.",US
2749,US,"This Chardonnay is so delicious in citrus, tropical fruit, peach and vanilla bean flavors, brightened with brisk acidity, that you hardly miss the absence of oak.",US
2750,US,"Classic Edna Valley Chardonnay, dry, minerally and crisp in acidity, with strong, upfront tangerine, pineapple and pear flavors. A clean, brisk and tasty Chardonnay for drinking now with salmon or ham.",US
2751,US,"A strong, oaky Chardonnay. Lacks subtlety and interest, but if you're looking for sheer power, it's for you. Shows pineapple jam, buttered toast and caramel flavors.",US
2752,US,"A captivating Chard that shows impeccable balance, and the price is very good for this level of quality. The fruit is brilliantly ripe in green apple, kiwi, Asian pear and lime flavors, with a deft touch of smoky oak. A firm minerality undergirds the structure.",US
2753,US,"An authoritative, distinguished Chard, from a producer with a good track record at this bottling. It's ripe and immediately appealing, in the California style, but despite 100% new oak, it doesn't taste oaky, and the citrus and tropical fruit flavors are balanced and complexed with wild herb and mineral notes. Should gain in interest over the next six years.",US
2754,US,"Morgan has been a real pioneer in the unoaked Chardonnay movement, and when the wine scores, it scores big. Consider this a run-scoring triple. It's totally dry, very acidic (officially, 7.13 g/L, for the statistically-minded) and austere, with a hard edge of minerals. What fruit there is suggests tart green apples and white nectarines. Believe me, you won't miss the oak.",US
2755,US,"If you prefer your California Chards on the minerally side instead of the flamboyant, superripe style, try this one. With its stony or metallic and citrus-inspired flavors and extreme dryness at low alcohol, it can be described as Chablisian. Hard to believe the oak is 100% new, as it doesn't taste oaky despite the streamlined profile.",US
2756,US,"This is an elegantly constructed wine. It's not especially rich, but subtle in citrus fruit, roasted nut, jasmine, vanilla and oak flavors, brightened with notable acidity. A note of green sage is distracting.",US
2757,US,"This Chardonnay has flavors of jammy tangerine, peach, tropical fruit and white sugar.",US
2758,US,"This delivers plenty of easy pineapple, orange and pear fruit flavors, with touches of vanilla and buttercream.",US
2759,US,"This has oak, green apple, lime and mineral flavors that finish dry and acidic. A sound wine that lacks richness.",US
2760,US,"Oak plays a prominent role in this Chard, giving it a wealth of sweet vanilla custard, butterscotch, toast and caramelized aromas and flavors. Under that coat is a ripe wine packed with pineapples and Meyer lemons. Drink this flamboyant wine now.",US
2761,US,"Tired of oaky fruit bomb Chards? This one's notable for structure. Crisp acidity and a firm streak of minerals undergird the grilled pineapple, cinnamon apple sauce and buttered toast flavors. Drink this elegant wine now.",US
2762,US,"Fresh tropical fruit, peach and apricot flavors star in this flashy young wine. Oak also plays a prominent role, giving buttered toast and caramel notes. And the texture is creamy and smooth. The overall impression is very rich and powerful, but the wine could have more finesse. Drink now.",US
2763,US,"Lincourt's grapes are so rich and well grown that they don't even need oak to make a delicious Chardonnay. The wine is dry and crisp, with appealing flavors of pineapples, tangerines and Meyer lemons. The savory creaminess seems to come from aging on the lees. What a great food wine.",US
2764,US,"Could finish drier, as there's a sugary sweetness throughout. But a lemony scour of acidity helps, and the flavors are extraordinarily rich, suggesting lemon meringue pie and pineapple marmalade.",US
2765,US,"Good price for a Chardonnay that's as good as many others costing far more. It's rich in pineapple, pear and oak flavors, brightened with zesty acidity.",US
2766,US,"Sometimes a reserve designation on a Chardonnay simply translates to excessive use of new oak; here it brings a rich abundance of fruit, along with a density and texture rarely found in domestic Chardonnays. This is a fruit salad of a wine, to be sure, running through a farmer's market's worth of peaches, apples, pears, apricots, bananas and more. But it also brings the butter, the butterscotch and the barrel toast, layered in and wrapped around the fruits so it has the richness of a banana split, and some of the creaminess as well.",US
2767,US,"This is a classy Chardonnay. Grown 1,200 feet above Calistoga and fairly well-oaked in new barrels, it's rich and complex, with flavors of grilled tropical fruits and toasted meringue. The structure is greatly improved by a crisp, minerally edge of acidity.",US
2768,US,"Structure, minerals and lees mark this elegant Chardonnay. You'll find ripe pear and tropical fruits that taste like they were baked into a pie, but ripe fruit is easy to achieve these days. It's the architectural integrity that makes this wine so fine.",US
2769,US,"A Chardonnay with noticeable barrel influence, this is creamy and thick, with a baked apple flavor. Pair it with chicken in cream sauce or lobster and butter.",US
2770,US,"Oaky and slightly sweet, this has vanilla, orange and oak flavors. It's a clean wine, but nothing beyond average.",US
2771,US,"Tasting on the sweet side, this has notes of brown sugar, honey and vanilla. It's clean and vibrant in acidity, with rich flavors of pineapple jam and ripe orange.",US
2772,US,"A subdued note of vanilla cake adds dimension to the broad, white-fruit-driven nose. Medium in body, this easygoing wine feels a bit loose on entrance, finishing with a subtle mineral hint.",US
2773,US,"This Harlequin has a faint scent of lemon liqueur that's offset by a white pepper note. The medium-weight palate offers a lemon blossom hint, and it finishes on the short side.",US
2774,US,"The winemaker aged this wine for 20 months in 100% new French oak, resulting in an oak-dominated product that bears notes of buttered toast, butterscotch and caramel. Green apple and pear flavors can be found, but they're basically swamped.",US
2775,US,"This is pure Chardonnay, from cool-climate sites, showing a lean, sculpted spine that both defines and expands the flavors. Exceptionally complex for Washington Chardonnay, with good natural acidity, a mix of peach, apple and pineapple fruit, and a finish that shows tight layering. There is a dense core that should unravel with bottle age; this is that rare Washington Chardonnay that will prosper with cellaring.",US
2776,US,"This is a sort of second tier wine from Talbott. It's a strongly flavored Chardonnay and extremely ripe, with pineapple jam, apricot-infused crème brûlée and sweet vanilla-butterscotch flavors. But for all the richness, it's crisp and bone dry. Easy to find, with 20,000 cases.",US
2777,US,"This is delicious, concentrated and showing a range of nuances; along with ripe apple and pear flavors come spicy hints of cinnamon and baking spices. Firm acids, good balance, and more texture and length than most domestic Chardonnays in this price range.",US
2778,US,"Aged 11 months in French oak, the roasty-toasty barrel notes are at the fore followed by peach and tropical fruit. What it lacks in subtlety it makes up for with a rich, creamy mouthfeel that draws out to a lingering finish.",US
2779,US,"Ripe apricot, mango and peach flavors mark this flashy Chardonnay. It's dry and oaky, with brisk acidity and a creamy mouthfeel. Don't drink it too cold.",US
2780,US,"An eccentric Chardonnay. It's certainly not shy, offering a blast of pineapple, Meyer lemon and Asian pear fruit flavors, brightened with good acidity and elaborated with oak. The trick with this kind of Chardonnay is to make it finish dry. This one doesn't.",US
2781,US,"Made in the Californian way of ripe fruit and sweet oak, this Chardonnay is dominated by flavors of buttered toast, buttered popcorn and pineapple jam. Will have plenty of fans of the popular style.",US
2782,US,"Very ripe and new oaky, but the acidity is so vibrant, it provides that much-needed balanced kick. Flavorwise, this Chard is a blast of orange Slurpee, pineapple tart, vanilla crème brûlée and cinnamon spice. It sure is an easy wine to drink.",US
2783,US,"Light in style and low in price and alcohol, this Chard is tropical and slightly sweet, perfect for your next-door neighbor or tippler aunt who doesn't often drink wine. For more experienced wine drinkers, the sweet doesn't overextend its welcome. Fine for weeknight roast chicken or pasta salad.",US
2784,US,"Made in the popular style, this Chardonnay has zesty acidity that gives brightness to the orange, pear, peach and tropical fruit flavors.",US
2785,US,"A Chardonnay to drink or serve at parties, this tastes slightly sweet, with orange, apricot and vanilla flavors. It also bears some creamy, oaky notes and lots of tangy acidity.",US
2786,US,"A simple, everyday Chardonnay that's refreshingly crisp, with sweet lime, orange, pear and vanilla flavors.",US
2787,US,"Acidity, dryness and steely minerality characterize this Chard. It has lemon and vanilla flavors that are brisk and clean. It's refreshing to get such an elegant alternative to today's ripe, fruity Chards. Gets better and better as it warms in the glass. Drink this brilliant wine with shellfish, sourdough bread and lots of butter.",US
2788,US,"A flashy wine. Shows sweet caramelized, buttered toast and vanilla custard notes from the oak, but the underlying fruit flavors, of golden mangoes and ripe pears, are strong enough to support the barrel influences.",US
2789,US,"This unoaked Chard has a fragrant floral nose, a lot of grapefruit and stone fruit flavor and slight sweetness with a mineral chaser on the finish.",US
2790,US,"A really nice, elegant Chardonnay at a good price. The wine is dry and lightly oaked, showing rich pineapple, peach, vanilla and buttered toast flavors enhanced with crisp acidity. Only 731 cases were produced of this lovely, food-friendly wine.",US
2791,US,"This is tight when first opened, with a hard-edged herbal character. Beneath that shell are richer, tropical fruit flavors of ripe banana, yellow apple and a hint of papaya; and with plenty of breathing time the wine softens and opens out. Roughly two thirds of the barrels were new French oak; and that is still being resolved into the fruit. This wine has a good 6–8 years of life ahead of it, but if you are drinking it now, decant it.",US
2792,US,"Direct and fruity, this Chardonnay is loaded with lemon.",US
2793,US,"Mild in fragrance, the nose offers hints of peanut shell, waxy melon and white peach, with a faint thread of orange zest. It feels soft and relaxed on entrance, but the acidity gains vitality across the palate, finishing zesty and light.",US
2794,US,"This is so oaky you can hardly taste anything but the butterscotch, caramel and brown sugar flavors. Way down deep is a note of pineapple jam.",US
2795,US,"Buttery, caramelized oak tones dominate the weak fruit flavors of orange and apricot. A simple and creamy Chardonnay.",US
2796,US,"Little aromatics can be discerned, but if pressed, there is a lightly vegetative note and a chalky, apple-like background. The light- to medium-bodied palate features a broad, tropical-fruit flavor, plus energized acids.",US
2797,US,"This has creamy flavors of vanilla, honey, lime and orange.",US
2798,US,"Soft and creamy and very elegant, this Chard has rich flavors of apricot tart, pineapple, Meyer lemon and chalky minerals. Really a well-structured, pulled-together wine of enormous appeal. Should improve through 2012.",US
2799,US,"Just what you want from a Sonoma Coast Chard. It's bone dry, crisp in cool-climate acidity, and elegant, with a minerally tang to the Meyer lemon fruit. Oak barrels bring richer notes of vanilla and buttered toast. Beautiful, and should hold through 2012.",US
2800,US,"Intricate and complex, with apricot, pineapple, golden currant, mineral and buttered toast flavors, balanced with fine acidity. Good now, and should evolve in interesting ways over the next six years",US
2801,US,"Made in a very ripe, very oaky manner, this Chardonnay is extraordinarily rich now, if not very subtle. It's all about power. Buttered toast, caramel cream, pineapple marmalade, lime, orange and spice flavors flood the mouth, snapping to an oaky finish.",US
2802,US,"A good Chardonnay, modestly oaked, with pleasant flavors of lemons, pineapples, buttered toast and cinnamon spice. Brisk acidity makes it finish bright and clean.",US
2803,US,"Made in the ripe, oaky style, this Chardonnay has buttered popcorn, caramel candy, pineapple marmalade and vanilla flavors. An appealing, direct wine to drink now.",US
2804,US,"This is a richly oaked young Chardonnay. It brims with ripe papaya, mango, pineapple and apple flavors, while the oak barrels add layers of buttered toast, honey and vanilla meringue.",US
2805,US,"Very dry and crisp and minerally. Shows a stony, steely edge to the pineapple, pear and Meyer lemon flavors, with 30% new French oak contributing vanilla, buttered toast and toffee complications. A bit rough now, and should soften and develop bottle complexity after 2010.",US
2806,US,"Young and tight, this was fermented almost entirely in stainless, with a small percentage in neutral oak. Acids are true and bright, and the fruit a mix of apple, pear and white peach. There's a little heat in the finish; an indication that this is a substantial wine that can stand up to spicier dishes—something like tandoori chicken might be just the ticket.",US
2807,US,"Oak barrels give this wine an edge of buttered toast and butterscotch, but it's not heavy, and the oak is perfectly in keeping with the underlying orange, mango and nectarine fruit. The finish is soft and honeyed, with a firm minerality that lends structure. It's yummy for drinking now.",US
2808,US,"Aged in a mixture of French oak (32% new) and stainless steel, it shows the best of both with fresh peach notes and barrel spices intermingling with crème fraîche. It's creamy in feel with the concentration winnowing slightly toward the finish.",US
2809,US,"They used wild yeasts to ferment this Chard, and there is something exotic and feral about the flavors, which go beyond nectarines and pears into fruits without names. It's missing some crispness, but shows richness and opulence.",France
2810,US,"Rich and tasty, this ripe Chard offers a blast of tropical fruit, smoke,   buttered toast and spice flavors that are wrapped into a creamy texture. Should hold for a year or two.",US
2811,US,"Simple and sweet, with orange marmalade and green mint jelly flavors. The oak tastes like vanilla pudding.",US
2812,US,"Sweet and simple, this Chard tastes like peach, pineapple and pear juice with a couple spoons of white sugar.",US
2813,US,"Frank rarely misses a mark and this wine is another example of the poised flavors one expects from this winery. The aromas are fresh but subtle, with a delicate spin of toasted oak. The wine offers a restrained and sophisticated profile that balances depth with a clean, measured use of oak.",US
2814,US,"Some will criticize this Chardonnay for being too oaky and sweet, but it sure is delicious. It just brims with pineapple, yellow apricot, crème brûlée, honey and buttered toast flavors that are balanced with crisp acidity. If you like that California style, you'll love this opulent wine.",US
2815,US,"Tasted in the Spring of 2009, this Chard was immature, marked by fresh fruit acidity and flavors, as well as unintegrated oak. But it's quite good, and just needs time to allow the grilled pineapple, crème brûlée and buttered toast flavors to come together with the alcohol. Best 2010–2013.",US
2816,US,"Crisply dry but very rich, even exotic, in fruit, this Chardonnay is a good value for the money. It's flamboyant in tropical pineapple jam, pears, vanilla custard and buttered toast, with a stony minerality.",US
2817,US,"Bright, fruity and spicy, this palate-lifting effort brings flavors of pineapple, pink grapefruit and melon. Lightly spicy, balanced and showing a little toast around the edges.",US
2818,US,"Very rich, ripe, oaky and delicious. Dazzles with waves of buttercream, buttered toast, buttered popcorn and butter-drizzled bananas, with plenty of underlying pineapple fruit and honey. Could be more subtle, though. It's all on the surface.",US
2819,US,"Generously oaked, with crème caramel and butterscotch from the barrels, this Chard also features very ripe underlying fruit flavors of golden mango and pineapple marmalade. It's fancy and generous, if a bit straightforward.",US
2820,US,"There's too much oak on this wine, and the underlying fruit isn't strong enough to support it. The result tastes like toothpicks, with modest flavors beneath of tangerines and pears.",US
2821,US,"An awkward Chard that tastes unnaturally oaky, with medicinal flavors of toasted, sweet vanilla bean. You'll find hints of pineapples and papayas, but that oaky thing is really strong.",US
2822,US,"An  everyday Chard, with superripe pear and apricot flavors and a thick coat of smoky oak.",US
2823,US,"Kind of weedy and green, with simple LifeSaver lemon candy flavors. The finish is dry and tart.",US
2824,US,"The wine is soft, simple and sweet, with flavors of canned peaches and pears.",US
2825,US,"A little soft and dull, but with enough Chard-like character to satisfy diehard fans who don't want to spend a lot. Has apple, peach and pear flavors with a candied taste of oak.",US
2826,US,"Clumsy, with a vegetal edge to the syrupy pineapple flavors. Finishes sweet enough to suspect some residual sugar.",US
2827,US,"This is soft and almost weightless, with no aromas and a midpalate that drops into a black hole. It's not that there are any off flavors; just that the search for flavor is, to put it bluntly, fruitless. Rare to find a wine with such a gaping hole in the middle.",US
2828,US,"A very nice Chardonnay for this price. It's barrel fermented and aged on the lees in the classic style, which gives smoky, creamy notes to the underlying pineapple, green apple, Meyer lemon and orange flavors. Vibrant Carneros acidity makes for a clean finish. Easy to find, with 13,000 cases produced.",US
2829,US,"With this 2008, Taz brings to the table a wonderful Chardonnay at a great price. It's dry and crisply acidic, with bright, perky flavors of oranges, peaches, Meyer lemons and smoky vanilla. Really nice and clean, a lovely wine and a good restaurant by-the-glass selection. Production was 9,000 cases.",US
2830,US,"Wow—delicious, the best yet. Lots of pineapple from the 75% Celilo fruit, very crisp and lightly butterscotchy. Big but not heavy, with alcohol in the mid-13% range. The wine fills in the midpalate nicely, weaving together rock, metal, butter and tropical fruit flavors in equal proportions. Good length also.",US
2831,US,"This crisp and stylish Chardonnay could serve as a poster child for Washington, with its emphasis on the fruit, not the barrel, and modest ripeness that accents green apple and gooseberry flavors, with a little brioche in the finish. Scented with apple blossoms and lemon oil, this style brings out the intensity of the fruit, and enhances the capacity of the wine to cleanse your palate, leaving you refreshed and ready for food.",US
2832,US,"This is a typical Sonoma Coast Chard in the bright acidity that firms up the ripe, long hangtime flavors. Pineapples, pears, peaches, nectarines and subtle papaya notes are joined with buttercream and cinnamon spices. Drink now.",US
2833,US,"This is a strong, oaky Chardonnay. It's crisp in acidity and forward in pineapple jam, lemon custard and vanilla meringue flavors. If you like the ripe, California style, it's for you.",US
2834,US,"Tangy and pleasantly round upon entry, this mingles fresh apple and peach fruit with baking spice highlights. There is a full midpalate, fruit-driven and flavorful, that gracefully tails off into a tart and juicy finish.",US
2835,US,"A very detailed Chard showing flashy layers of ripe tropical fruits, tangerines, pastry crust, minerals and lees. The grapes are from the winery's estate vineyard in Carneros, and the wine's acidity is bright and zesty.",US
2836,US,"Sourced from three great Chardonnay vineyards (Stanly Ranch, Hyde and Silverado-Suscol), this Chard is enormously flavorful in fruit custard flavors and new oak. It's delicious, but a little obvious, especially on the oak side, and could have more complex nuances and angles. Drink now.",US
2837,US,"A fine Chard, richly oaked and ripely forward in tropical fruit, pear and green apple flavors wrapped into a spicy, buttercreamy mouthfeel. Really nails the California style.",US
2838,US,"Soft and sweet, this Chard has candied flavors of pineapples, peaches and vanilla. The sugary taste makes it finish like soda.",US
2839,US,"Not much to like in this semisweet, soft Chard. It tastes like the syrup from canned peaches and pears.",US
2840,US,"With an over-oaked taste and sugary flavors of peach, pineapple and apricot jam, this Chard is more like a dessert wine.",US
2841,US,"Nothing subtle about this big, ripe, oaky Chardonnay. It shows the tropical fruit richness of a fine Alexander Valley Chard, flamboyant in pineapple custard flavor, with a flinty minerality. The sweet overlay of smoky oak is perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume.",US
2842,US,"Exciting, fresh and full of spicy, toasted undertones, this wine immediately calls for a food pairing of a richer seafood (think oysters, crab) or poultry. The flavors are balanced and buoyed by crispness, but the wine still offers complexity and a lingering finish.",US
2843,US,"A racy, citric undertone and spicy toast beckon on this fun, fresh wine from New York. On the palate, there's an impressive roundness and a touch of butter on the tongue, but a very pretty wave of flowers, minerality and zip keep it light.",US
2844,US,"This estate-grown Chardonnay opens with lots of new oak aromas, excellent fruit material, with Meyer lemon, yellow apple, hints of white peach. The phenolics give the wine some excellent texture, and it has a long and smooth finish.",US
2845,US,"Huge, rich, white Burgundy style Chardonnay. Has a pie-filling fruity richness of pineapples, lemondrop, pears, kiwi fruit and exotic kumquats, balanced with fine, minerally acidity, and wrapped into a buttercream texture. The oak is flamboyant, but perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume. Dazzling and dramatic, from a vineyard that just keeps performing better and better.",US
2846,US,"Guaranteed to please the most discriminating Chardonnay fans for its dry crispness, great structure and endless opulence. Massively complex, offering waves of grilled pineapple, pear, buttered toast and smoky vanilla. The grapes came mainly from Bien Nacido Vineyard, with the balance from Sierra Madre. Only 338 cases produced.",US
2847,US,"Bob Cabral's Chardonnays sometimes get lost in the brilliant glare of his Pinot Noirs, but he has spent years exploring the rich, flamboyant side of the variety, with great success. This bottling represents William Selyem Chardonnay at its best. It's ultra-decadent in apricot and pear flavors, with a strong oak influence, and yet an underlying minerality and fine acidity balance it so that it doesn't tire as you drink. In fact, you want more.",US
2848,US,"Massively rich, with pronounced, sweet, smoky oak flavors and a rich vein of tart, creamy lees highlighting the underlying fruity ripeness. Shows flavors of grilled pineapples, tropical mangoes and pears, balanced with crisp acids. Tremendously delicious and compelling.",US
2849,US,"Amazingly rich, one of the most opulent Chardonnays you can drink now. Just wows the mouth with pineapple, pear, exotic tropical fruit, crème brûlée, vanilla custard, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors that go on and on through the finish. Also shows fine, tart acidity, which provides needed balance. Yes, it's superripe, but this is what California Chardonnay does at its best.",US
2850,US,"Massive, opulent, oozing in pineapple créme brulée, honey, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors. Totally decadent, and fortunately set off with brisk, citrusy acidity. Calling all lobsters, and don't forget the drawn butter. Sheer hedonism in a glass, at a fantastic price.",US
2851,US,"Massively fruity and oaky, this is an atom bomb of a Chardonnay. You either love this style or you hate it. The pineapple tart, apricot, pear, peach, crème brûlée, buttered toast, vanilla cream and cinnamon spice flavors go on and on. Beyond the utter richness is firm acidity and a bracing minerality. Defines California-style decadence, but drink now, as the wine will quickly go downhill.",US
2852,US,"Superrich, ripe and flamboyant, if not particularly subtle. Dazzles for its tsunami of grilled pineapple custard, pear tart, golden mango and Key lime pie richness, accented with sweetly, caramelized oak, and brightened with brisk acidity. A racy, decadent crowd pleaser.",US
2853,US,"Offering pleasant, approachable flavors of apple and Asian pear, along with streaks of vanilla and butterscotch, this wine is drinking well and may best be enjoyed while it's fresh and young.",US
2854,US,"On the Washington side of the Columbia Gorge, the Celilo Vineyard is an exceptional site for Chardonnay. This was sourced from the 1983 planting, and the relatively old vines and cool vintage deliver a wine with excellent minerality, lift, drive and focus. The fruit is tangy and yellow/green, but perfectly ripe; the acid underpinning is fresh and lively. This has every chance of cellaring until 2024 or later.",France
2855,US,"Good price for a Chardonnay this dry and acidic, yet rich. The upfront impression is all about tartness and minerality, yet there are ripe apricot, papaya and lime fruit flavors. Don't drink it too cold, as it gains traction and interest as it warms in the glass.",US
2856,US,"Chateau St. Jean continues to teach Chard wannabes how the game is played. This is a huge wine, but one of extraordinary finesse and interest. One reason is winemaker Margo van Staaveren's instinct for controlled tension. Another is the winery's access to fruit from throughout the county. Rich and opulent and powerful, this Chardonnay is, in a word, great.",France
2857,US,"This one's a prime example of how fat overripeness is yielding to a leaner balance and elegance. Not that there's anything austere about this luscious Chard, with its white apricot, citron, guava and mineral flavors. It's a terrific wine and showcases Hartford Court at its best.",France
2858,US,"Bone dry, high in acidity, minerally and stony like granite, with the essence of Meyer lemon and green pears, and a leesy, Champagne-like doughiness. There's toasty oak in the background. Elegant and complex now, and should ride out the next decade.",US
2859,US,"Earthy, like some Napa Chards, with a sage and thyme edge to the pear and peach fruit. The wine also is a little soft. But there's an interesting minerality. Could develop bottle complexity over the next few years.",US
2860,US,"A round, full character with ample layers of creamy spice and balanced acid recommend this elegant, more traditional Chardonnay from the Finger Lakes. The mouthfeel is full but poised, and the finish long.",US
2861,US,"This is a bit fat and forward, with flavors of tropical fruit and banana, and a light dusting of cocoa, cinnamon and butterscotch. It's a tasty wine to drink up as soon as possible.",US
2862,US,"Simple, sweet and oaky, this Chard has ripe flavors of tropical fruits, pears, lemon tarts and vanilla. It's fine for big parties where Chard is in demand.",US
2863,US,"Oaky and direct in ripe tropical fruit, with a gooseberry taste more akin to Sauvignon Blanc, this Chard is unripe and simple.",US
2864,US,"Starts with an opulent, inviting aroma of smoky honey, vanilla, tangerines, Meyer lemons, yellow apricots, green apples and minerals. In the mouth, the flavors are very similar—an explosion of fruits, spices and toast. Just a tremendous wine, but for all the volume and complexity, it's completely balanced.",US
2865,US,"Available only in magnums, this Chard consists of a single barrel from the estate vineyard, which is in the Petaluma area, a very cool region. The wine is very fine. It's equal parts ripe green pears, Meyer lemons and smoky oak, with a firm, steely underpinning of minerals. Should age well for a Chardonnay, especially in the big bottle.",US
2866,US,"This is a very low-production, best-of-barrels selection by the winemaker. It's an extremely tight young wine, austere and almost searing in acidity, with a yeasty taste from sur lies aging. If you're looking for opulent, immediately accessible Chardonnay, this isn't for you. But the wine has tantalizing hints of grilled pineapples and nectarines, and the powerful structure suggests cellaring. Stash this away for a couple of years.",US
2867,US,"Rich and oaky, with crisp acidity framing flavors of pineapple crème brûlée, yellow apricot jam, buttered toast and meringue. Flamboyant, but controlled and elegant. Drink now.",US
2868,US,"A beautiful, lush Chardonnay, made in the ripe California style. Rich and creamy, marked with brisk acidity, it shows wonderful flavors of pineapples, roasted marshmallows, buttered toast and vanilla, with a tart, spicy scour of lime. Brilliant and complex. The vineyards were a combination of Sierra Madre and Bien Nacido.",US
2869,US,"Shows amazingly ripe fruit, offering a blast of pineapple jam, apricot, tangerine, papaya and lime flavors. The acidity is crisp and tart, and the oak is rich and flamboyant, yet in keeping with the size of the underling wine. Super-rich and decadent, this Chardonnay is at its best soon.",US
2870,US,"Lots of exotic flavors in this barrel-fermented Chardonnay. Its deep in gold color, indicating richness and oak, and follows through with pineapples, mangos, tangerine sorbet, buttered toast, buttercotch, vanilla cream and cinnamon spice. Great price for a Chard this good.",US
2871,US,"Williams Selyem is now playing the unoaked game, and with their fruit sources, wow. Most winemakers would kill to put oak onto these grapes. The wine is tremendous in pineapples, pears, papayas and kiwi fruit. It's so rich, you won't even notice the absence of caramel and all those oaky influences.",US
2872,US,"It's common to complain that American oak isn't as good as French oak, but this wine disproves that. The wood shows up as rich in caramel, buttered toast and vanilla spice notes that provide a lovely counterpoint to the wine's grilled pineapple and lime fruit. This is a beautiful, interesting Chardonnay.",US
2873,US,"An enormously rich Chard brimming with Mandarin orange, tangerine, pineapple, butterscotch and toasty oak flavors. Cool-climate acidity provides a brisk sense of balance to this charming, affordable wine.",US
2874,US,"Columbia Crest winemaker Ray Einberger makes four different Chardonnays, this H3 being the newest in the lineup. It has more clean definition, more cut and precision, by far. Yes, there are light tropical fruit flavors and plenty of butter, but it's set up nicely against a firmer, peppery base.",US
2875,US,"Rich as can be, but oak dominates, giving the wine buttered toast and caramelized vanilla flavors, and you'll even find notes of buttered popcorn. Although there's lovely pineapple and citron fruit and fine Carneros acidity, this Chardonnay tastes overly manipulated.",US
2876,US,"Packs plenty of punch into an inexpensive, everyday Chardonnay. With brisk, tangy acidity, it offers rich, appealing flavors of pineapples, green apples, vanilla and sweet, creamy butter.",US
2877,US,"Showing ripe peach, pineapple and honeysuckle flavors, this Chard, from the cooler southern part of the valley, is balanced with crisp acidity. Oak plays a prominent role, offering spicy crème brûlée complexities.",US
2878,US,"Seascape is perhaps the winery's coldest vineyard, right in the path of the wind blast coming in off Bodega Bay. You can taste the Pacific chill in the high acidity that makes the fruit so pure and intense. The flavors, of Meyer lemons, lime zest and stony minerals, are bracing, and the finish is absolutely, thoroughly dry. This is a sommelier's dream of a Chardonnay.",France
2879,US,"Rich, creamy and lush, this is right up to the very high standard set by the rest of Novelty Hill's white wines. It's rare to taste an American Chardonnay with this mix of exotically ripe fruit, baking spices and crisp natural acids. It just hits every base square on, and takes its time rounding third and heading for a home plate finish. A very impressive effort.",US
2880,US,"This is a good example of what Finger Lakes Chards can offer: assertive, full-flavored Chardonnay flavors and layers of spice edged by a clean minerality. Balanced and offering a supple mouthfeel, the wine is both food friendly and elegant.",US
2881,US,"Luscious fruit and toast aromas are the beginning of this fun wine from Fox Run. On the palate, it offers good Chardonnay flavors and a round, supple mouthfeel. It's not terribly complex but is flavorful and has dimension.",US
2882,US,"With a generous bite of acidity, this fine Chardonnay is extremely flavorful. Traditionally one of the winery's top Chards, it's explosive in pineapple, Asian pear, crème brûlée and roasted marshmallow flavors. Finishes in a swirl of creamy, buttery spices.",US
2883,US,"This is the winery's best Chardonnay blend. It comes mainly from Sanford & Benedict Vineyard, and shows the fine structure associated with the appellation. Juicy acidity firms up the oak-inspired Meyer lemon, crushed pineapple and tangy mineral flavors. Should soften and become more complex over the next six years.",US
2884,US,"This is a terrific wine, extremely powerful in fruity flavors. It impresses for its sheer volume. Waves of apricots, nectarines, pears, green apples, butterscotch, buttered toast and smoky, vanilla-tinged oak surf the palate, carried along on a wave of crisp acidity.",US
2885,US,"This cold-climate vineyard is source to some of the most powerful Chardonnays in California. The '05 shows the massive tropical mango, guava, nectarine, apricot and pineapple flavors the vineyard effortlessly delivers. Almost over the top, it's saved by very crisp acidity.",US
2886,US,"Comes down on the dry, acidic, minerally side of the Chardonnay street. Fans of opulence will find it lacking, but it's so clean and subtle in pineapple tart, tangerine and buttered toast flavors, it recommends itself as one of the more elegant and food-friendly Chards out there.",US
2887,US,"Lives up to its reserve status, being the creamiest and most densely packed of Roche's several new Chardonnays. With brisk, bright acidity and ripe flavors of pineapples, Key lime pie and vanilla cream, its buttered toast and char flavors provide the perfect counterpoint from oak barrel aging.",US
2888,US,"Fragrant and lush with floral/citrus aromas, this stainless-fermented Chardonnay is inviting and seductive. Brilliant, bright fruit anchors a wine that is tense and dense and vividly thrilling. The acids are natural and flavors seamlessly run from lemon/lime to pineapple to orange, and keep on keeping on, with fresh, water-washed rock in the finish.",US
2889,US,"Lots of razzle-dazzle in this rich, opulent Chardonnay. Shows buttery, oak-inspired pear and pineapple flavors, with a leesy, creamy mouthfeel, and fine acidity to brighten and balance all that richness. Drink this decadent wine with lobster, scallops, crab or shrimp, or a great ahi tuna tartare with potato chips.",US
2890,US,"As is the custom, the blend includes 5% Viognier, adding some floral scents that lift the aromas. The 2007 is saturated with a candy/caramel flavor, not unpleasant, but quite prominent. It is not, however, flabby or over-ripe; the buttery flavors work smoothly with the pristine apple, pear and melon-flavored fruit, and the wine has a seamless proportionality that lingers into the finish.",US
2891,US,"Made in a dry, lean style, this Chard has plenty of elegance. It has citrus, pear and mineral flavors, with a touch of oak and bright, brisk, coastal acidity.",US
2892,US,"Some new French oak brings a rich, buttery smokiness to this Chardonnay, but mostly it's about the fruit. It's rich in tangerine, apricot and papaya flavors that are drinking well now.",US
2893,US,"From a vineyard in the Green Valley, it has ripe flavors of apricots, tangerines, peaches, pears and Meyer lemons, with lots of smoky, honeyed notes of new French oak. Not very subtle, it will appeal to fans of oaky, ripe Chardonnay.",US
2894,US,"That terrific Santa Rita acidity is there, and the oak regimen tastes very expensive, but the fruit doesn't seem up to the task. It's a pretty good wine, with pineapples, dates, crème brûlée and spices, but there should be greater richness and complexity from this esteemed vineyard.",US
2895,US,"Pronounced minerality and fresh, bright fruit are balanced nicely in this stylish wine. A touch of spice adds dimension. Pair with poultry dishes.",US
2896,US,"It's all upfront in this direct Chard, with ripe pineapple, yellow apricot and passionfruit flavors that have been generously oaked. Will satisfy fans of big, lush California Chards. Drink now.",US
2897,US,"Frog's Leap's Chards always have a softly herbal earthiness, even though there's plenty of pineapple, green apple, apricot and vanilla oaky flavor. That herbaceousness keeps the wine from soaring.",US
2898,US,"An acidic, bone-dry Chardonnay, brilliant in fruit, that doesn't seem to have been touched by oak. It's so pure in zesty Meyer lemon, lime and kiwi flavors, with a mouthwateringy clean finish.",US
2899,US,"Pessagno has a perfect track record with this cool-climate vineyard, consisently producing Chards of this caliber. The wine is tight in acids and flinty minerals, even showing new oaky tannins. But the exotic nuances of roasted peaches and grilled pineapples suggest cellarability. Best after 2008.",US
2900,US,"This is Baileyana's top Chardonnay, and the '06 defines what makes Edna Valley such a special place to grow it. Acidity and ripeness are the stars, with bright, explosive flavors of pineapples, pears, Meyer lemons, limes and kiwi fruits. The smoky, spicy oak is perfectly integrated into this delightful wine.",US
2901,US,"Iron Horse's estate Chard is a remarkably consistent wine. Never overoaked, superripe or heavy, it always has an elegant minerality. The '06, from a coolish vintage, is flavored with green apples, Meyer lemons and Bosc pears.",US
2902,US,"There's something tight and minerally and acidic about this Chardonnay that will appeal to connoisseurs of austere wines. Even though the oak is nearly one-half new, the wine has a lean, lemony taste, with nuances of crème brûlée and roasted hazelnuts. Defines food-friendly elegance, and could develop bottle complexity over the next 5 years.",US
2903,US,"Richly oaked, fantastically ripe in long hangtime fruit, this Chard has exotic flavors of golden mangoes, nectarines, passionfruit, pineapple jam and kiwis. Oak adds extra layers of buttered toast, crème brûlée and smoky vanilla. For all the honeyed sweetness, it's totally dry, a tour de force that's at its best now.",US
2904,US,"This is a bigger and riper bottle all around than any other Columbia Crest Chardonnays. You get more power—big tropical fruit flavors and even more of the buttered popcorn character than defines the entire lineup—but the tradeoff is that there is less detail, more alcohol, and an over-riding simplicity that risks becoming boring. Grab the H3 if you want complexity; this bottle is for those who want the power.",US
2905,US,"Here's an oaky, ripe Chardonnay for those who like these strong, direct hits. It's powerful in tropical fruit, citrus, pear and green apple flavors, with a creamy overlay of buttery oak. Drink now.",US
2906,US,"Rich and opulent, in the California coastal style. The grapes come from some respected Carneros vineyards, including Hyde and Stanly Ranch, and the pedigree shows in the balance of ripeness and acidity. With pineapple, mango, green apple, crème brûlée and buttered toast flavors, it's just delicious. Great with Dungeness crab and sourdough bread and butter.",US
2907,US,"Offering none of the oaky, fruity richness of popular Chardonnays, this bottle needs to be figured out in a different way. It's super-dry, acidic and minerally, with citrus fruit flavors that seem barely touched by oak. It's a wine of structural integrity, made in the style of a great Chablis. One of the rare Chardonnays that should age.",US
2908,US,"This is Martin Ray's best non-reserve Chard in years. In fact, it's as good as some of their reserves. It shows real richness, with fancy oak and lees influences and complex the peach and pear fruit flavors.",US
2909,US,"Almost a repeat of the ‘05, in which the oak dominated everything else. Those waves of caramel and buttered toast taste good, and together with the pineapples and pears, give the wine an exotic taste of some creamy, spicy, honey-rich mashed fruit pudding.",US
2910,US,"The winery turned to Edna Valley for this '07 Chard, which shows all the fine qualities of that Central Coast region. The wine is high in acidity, dry and ultra-clean, with powerful flavors of golden kiwi fruit, limes and vanilla honey.",US
2911,US,"Barrel fermented and aged on the lees for almost a year, this is a nutty, slightly oily wine that shows the influence of the barrel, but lacks the fruit density to match it. The 14% alcohol hits the palate with some heat. High-toned and a bit harsh.",US
2912,US,"A very appealing nose of earthy spice starts this successful Chard, and leads into a full, rounded blanket of toasted oak and fruit. There's complexity here without heaviness, and the wine finishes big but pretty. Pair with richer seafood—like crab—or creamy poultry dishes.",US
2913,US,"This is rich and fruity and direct. It appeals for its acid-laced lime, kiwi, passionfruit and pineapple flavors and rich, smoky coat of oak.",US
2914,US,"Like Iron Horse's other '05 Chards, this is a hard, minerally wine. The color is green-tinged, the aroma like lime juice drizzled onto a steel-bladed knife. With lime-grapefruit flavors and high acidity, it's an elegantly-structured wine that may surprise with development over the years.",France
2915,US,"Very pleasant, relatively light, showing a pretty mix of citrus and tropical fruit, fresh cream, light toast and a hint of cinnamon. The alcohol rests at 14.1% but feels a bit lighter, and the wine has a pleasing ripeness without becoming fat or heavy.",US
2916,US,"Sweetly ripe and oaky, with pineapple marmalade, lemon custard, vanilla and smoky meringue flavors. The alcohol is a refreshingly low 13.9%.",US
2917,US,"Shows the dramatic structure of a fine coastal Chardonnay, with crisp acidity and a bracing minerality framing ripe, lush flavors of pineapples, tangerines, pears and sweet, caramelized oak. Very rich and fine, deserving of the best shellfish, salmon, ahi tuna.",US
2918,US,"This is a big, ripe, rich and oaky Chardonnay, the kind that will seduce lots of people with sheer dazzle, although only 135 cases were produced so it's likely to be hard to find. Dry and crisp, it's concentrated in pineapple tart and peach marmalade flavors, accented with plenty of sweet, smoky oak, and brightened with crisp Monterey acidity.",US
2919,US,"Has great weight and texture, with an unctuous, oily mouthfeel, and is crisp and dry. Almost like a great Chablis, with a tang of steel and minerals undergirding the limes, pineapples and wildflowers. The grapes are from the well-regarded Sierra Madre Vineyard.",US
2920,US,"A rich, brisk and complex Chardonnay that shows cool-climate structure and the ripe fruit that comes from a good vintage and great viticulture, in a difficult growing region. The pineapple, pear and golden mango flavors are enriched with lots of smoky, buttery oak, and offset with crisp acidity. Decadent and delicious.",US
2921,US,"At this reasonable price, this wine is a great success. It's dry, crisp in acidity and creamy in texture, with pleasant orange, pineapple and apricot flavors. What a nice restaurant wine, and easy to find, with 17,500 cases produced.",US
2922,US,"Fresh apple and pear aromas are lifted with hints of white flowers and honeydew on this full-bodied, elegantly balanced wine. The palate is slick with a drizzle of cream adding richness to flavors of apple and lemon, but balanced with bright acidity and a brisk saline finish.",US
2923,US,"The winery has been doing a great job with their Chard lately. It's a mountain wine and shows typical concentration, with very pure, ripe flavors of peaches, pears and pineapples. It's right up there at the threshold of too oaky and sweet, though it stops just short.",US
2924,US,"A rich, direct Chard that leaves little to the imagination. It offers a sunburst of oak-inspired tropical fruit flavors that are very ripe and jammy, in the modern California style.",US
2925,US,"A light floral and toasty nose leads into this clean, slightly racy Chardonnay from New York. There's a touch of sweetness to the wine but it's balanced by good oak and an earthiness to the finish.",US
2926,US,"For lovers of the big California Chardonnays, this wine delivers. Bold aromas of buttery spice lead into full flavors of cream, butter and spice. The wine offers complexity and unfolds nicely on the palate. A white that can handle rich dishes and can age.",US
2927,US,"Here's a likeable Chard, with peach, pear and fig flavors that have a distinctly herbal edge, like dried sage. Turns buttery and vanilla-y on the finish.",US
2928,US,"A little too ripe and oaky for elegance, this is almost dessert-like, in the sweet vanilla, crème brûlée and pineapple jam flavors. Crisp acidity helps to balance.",US
2929,US,"Fresh toast, wooded spice  on the nose is friendly and appealing. On the palate, it works too, with its playful balance of layered spice oak and fresh acidity. The wine will appeal to fans of both oaked and unoaked Chardonnay, and will make a nice addition to the table.",France
2930,US,"Hints of tropical fresh fuit and flowers lends an exotic touch to this pretty wine, and on the palate, it offers balanced elements of crisp fruit and spicy oak. Not terribly complex but a friendly food wine.",US
2931,US,"Layers of round, appealing Chardonnay aromas lead into this nicely balanced offering from New York. Earthy spice and good acidity give the wine both complexity and elegance, and the finish is lengthy. A good wine for solo sips or pairing with poultry and fish.",US
2932,US,"Polished and sophisticated Chard, easy to like for its dry crispness, and the way the bright acidity perks up the tropical fruit and mineral flavors. It's 100% barrel-fermented, but the oak feels very natural and seamless. Finishes with real class and elegance.",US
2933,US,"There's a succulent richness to this Burgundian-inspired Chard that makes it delicious. It's bright in acids, the main ingredient needed to balance the opulent pineapple, peach, yellow apricot vanilla custard and smoky oak flavors. Creamy and dry, it provides pleasure all the way through.",US
2934,US,"This bottling has been remarkably consistent over the last several vintages. Always exotic in lemondrop-candy fruit that's been well-oaked, it has nuances of flower petals, white peaches, minerals and honey. The '06 may be a little softer than past vintages.",France
2935,US,"Reminiscent of the 2000, this wine has a crisp, linear character that emphasizes minerals rather than the overt tropical fruits the vineyard shows in warmer vintages. It's a fine, dry, acidic Chardonnay whose oak-infused lemon and lime flavors will complement sourdough bread and cracked crab.",US
2936,US,"From the Evergreen Vineyard, in the Ancient Lakes region north of the Wahluke Slope, this is surprisingly high-powered, at 13.9% alcohol, with a big smack of oak in the nose. That oak is wrapped around green banana and green apple fruit, with a little vanilla on the side. As young as it is, it seems likely to knit together and improve over the next year or two.",US
2937,US,"Sweet oak and lightly tropical fruit flavors characterize this young, tight, full-bodied Chardonnay. With another year or two in bottle, the fruit should emerge from behind the new oak flavors and enhance the overall balance. In the meanwhile, decanting is a good idea.",US
2938,US,"Superrich in vanilla cream, buttered toast, pineapple jam and tangerine sorbet flavors, with a honeyed finish. Is it dry or sweet? Seems both at the same time, accented with bright, Central Coast acidity. Drink now.",US
2939,US,"One hundred percent new French oak is the dominant theme here. It floods the mouth with the flavors of buttered toast and vanilla. The oak influence is strong, but the underlying wine has some equally strong pineapple, mango and apple fruit. It's made in a rich California style you either love or hate.",US
2940,US,"Oak overpowers this wine, dominating with buttered toast and caramel flavors. Underneath is pineapple and peach fruit and zesty acidity. It would be nice to have the winemaker back off on the barrels and emphasize the underlying wine.",US
2941,US,"A big, lush Chardonnay from the Wente family's Ernest Wente Vineyard, this is barrel fermented and aged on lees for a long 18 months in new American and French oak. A successful layering of ripe apples, a tinge of pineapple and hearty bread with tons of texture and length made in an opulent California style.",US
2942,US,"Good price for a dry, crisp and flavor Chardonnay with some real fancy character. Flatters the palate with opulent pineapple jam, pear, lemon and orange fruit flavors, finished with rich oak.",US
2943,US,"Drink this with very rich foods, such as shellfish in a buttery cream sauce. It's a big, oaky, caramelly wine, with ripe pineapples beneath the oak. A little soft, but smooth and silky. An elegant Chardonnay for drinking now.",US
2944,US,"A good, rich, oaky Chardonnay that will satisfy your sweet tooth. It's bursting in ripe pineapple jam, lime, pear and buttered toast flavors, with clean, zesty acidity for balance.",US
2945,US,"This has 5% Sauvignon Blanc in the blend. It's done in all stainless steel; the Chardonnay is tight and spicy, with melon and apple flavors. There's a vitamin pill streak that comes up also, and then it leads into some almond flavors in the finish. It's almost like a northern Italian style, with almond and pepper and relatively high acid. Good food wine.",US
2946,US,"At first pass, this feels a little tired, with a somewhat feeble nose and flavors that could tend toward bitter. But in the mouth, the wine impresses—the fruit is pretty and round, the mouthfeel smooth. Spice and fruit come together nicely and chase away any austerity that may be lurking. The finish is good and layered.",US
2947,US,"From giant Brown-Forman, it's a lip-smackingly fruity Chard, bigtime in pineapple, vanilla and smoky caramel flavors, with a sweet, honeyed finish.",US
2948,US,"With this wine's slightly rustic character, it makes it a slightly harder Chardonnay to love, but interesting notes of spice add interest. The wine lacks some dimension but overall, offers pretty flavors and a food-friendly minerality.",US
2949,US,"Lots going on in this complex young Chard. It shows crisp, zippy acidity and a firm, steely minerality that marries well with the oak and lees to produce a coconut cream pie, macaroon richness. That's on top of the tropical fruit. Delicious now, and should hang in there for four years or so.",US
2950,US,"Showing Talley's distinctive elegance and brilliant structure, this Chard is a blend of the Rincon and Rosemary's vineyards. The wine's architecture really makes it special, with acidity and dusty tannins providing the bare bones to the lemon, lime, pineapple and mango fruit. A great wine to have with food.",US
2951,US,"Creamy smooth and enlivened with brisk acidity, this Chard shows forward, tart green apple, lime and pineapple flavors. Oak barrels add even richer notes of buttered toast and butterscotch to this elegant sipper.",US
2952,US,"Oak sticks out in the form of buttered toast and caramel, while the pineapple, golden mango and honey flavors are very strong. The wine also is marked by notable acidity. Seems like all the parts need a little time to meld into harmony. Give it until mid-2011.",US
2953,US,"This is a decadently rich Chardonnay, although it depends for its appeal mainly on oak and ripe fruit, rather than nuance. Explodes with pineapple jam, golden mango, crème brûlée, buttered toast, honey and cinnamon spice flavors. Ready now.",US
2954,US,"Offers a tremendous burst of ripe green apples, bosc pears and Meyer lemons, brightened with the crisp acidity of cool Green Valley. Also, tinges of vanilla and cream, despite being unoaked.",US
2955,US,"Oaky, with butterscotch and smoky caramel-honey flavors standing out over the underlying pineapples, oranges and minerals. Finishes dry and crisp. Drink now.",US
2956,US,"Released unusually at the age of nearly five years, this Chardonnay is losing its primary fruit. It's developing a toasted cashew and hazelnut character, and the pineapples are transmogrifying to chewy dried fruits and even Christmas fruitcake. Meanwhile the sweet, caramelized oak is fully integrated. Bravo to the winery for holding this back and letting us see what an older Sonoma Coast Chardonay does.",US
2957,US,"A very interesting Chardonnay, and easily worth the price. It was fermented in 50% new French oak, which gives it a creamy, smoky richness, while the underlying fruit flavors are ripe and rewarding, suggesting pineapples, Asian pears, green apples and Meyer lemons. A beautiful, complex and balanced wine.",US
2958,US,"A little obvious in its appeal to our liking for oak and ripe fruit. Who can criticize the pineapples, citrons, tangerines and green apples, with their overlay of caramel and buttered toast? Rich as it is, you find yourself wishing it were more subtle and nuanced. Drink now.",US
2959,US,"The fruit is front and center on this oak-free Chardonnay. It's enormously rich in apricots, tangerines, pineapples, pears and lemons, with brisk acidity and a tang of minerals.",US
2960,US,"Oak dominates this wine. The idea seems to have been Chablis, to judge by the dryness and citrusy minerality. But the char and toast are very strong and the underlying richness isn't there for balance.",France
2961,US,"Previous vintages tasted more balanced than this super-oaky one. The wood erupts from the glass, suggestive of caramel, buttered popcorn, vanilla cream pie and charcoal, overwhelming what seems to be a perfectly nice wine. Some folks will love it. Others will find it the poster child of overoaked California Chard.",US
2962,US,"The new oak stands out and dominates this Chard, and while the toasty vanilla, caramel and charred woodsap flavors are pleasant, they overpower the modest pineapple and apple fruit.",US
2963,US,"A clean, classic minerality leads on this unique and food-friendly Chardonnay. On the palate, fresh fruit flavors mingle with a touch of oak, and the finish offers both length and character.",US
2964,US,"A soft, feminine nose of toasted oak and round fruit on the nose, and a flavor profile of balanced fruit and acid on the palate, make this a good white for both cold weather, serious meals and just sipping on the patio in warmer months. The mouthfeel is a touch light and the wine could use some weight, but overall, a good choice for numerous dishes.",US
2965,US,"New oak seems to dominate this Chard, swamping the actual flavor of the wine. The grapes provide lovely apricots and pineapples, balanced with fine acidity, but the oak swamps with smoke and vanilla and sappy wood cream.",US
2966,US,"A little thin and herbal, but shows enough Chard character to accompany good shellfish or a chicken or veal dish. Modestly oaked, the wine has peach, tangerine, buttercream and smoky flavors.",US
2967,US,"Here's an everyday, country-style Chardonnay with good enough flavors of tropical fruits and smoky vanilla oak, and a nicely creamy texture, to satisfy.",US
2968,US,"Creamy fresh white fruit and toast on the nose hint at a fullness that the wine does not quite deliver on the palate, but overall the fruit is good. This tends toward tart and needs the balance of more oak to cut the edge.",US
2969,US,"The oak is sweet and upfront but well-proportioned to the size of the fruit in this luscious Chardonnay, which comes from a cooler part of Napa Valley. There's Carneros-like acidity and very ripe, forward pear, peach, pineapple and date nut bread flavors.",US
2970,US,"A very interesting wine that clearly shows its cool-climate origins, with a great big burst of brisk acidity that gets the tastebuds whistling. Underneath are pure flavors of green apples and ripe kiwis. The oak is sizable, but perfect for this formula, adding delicious honey, butterscotch and vanilla flavors. This is the best J. Lynne Chard I've had.",US
2971,US,"Very tight now, with minerally, yeasty flavors of lees and unintegrated smoky new oak. High acidity adds to the impression of austerity. Difficult to appreciate in its infancy, but this elegant, layered, complex Chard should begin to blossom after 2008 and hold for several years.",US
2972,US,"This is all Birch Creek vineyard fruit, barrel fermented and put through full malolactic. It's soft, fleshy and buttery, with good ripe light tropical fruit, lots of barrel flavor, and enough acid to support it all. Both Rulo Chardonnays are perfect expressions of their style—one oaked, one unoaked—each in fine balance and proportion.",US
2973,US,"Shows the slight tug of herbaceousness that often marks Carneros/Napa Chardonnays. But it's very dry and crisp, and there's a minerality that helps this lemon- and lime-flavored wine pair cleanly with shellfish, salmon or just a good roast chicken.",US
2974,US,"A very nice Chardonnay that's dry and crisp and elegant. Shows tart, leesy flavors of citrus fruits, apricots and pears, with a steely minerality that may come from those famous Livermore rocks. Great price for a Chardonnay of this quality.",US
2975,US,"Talbott's style is always exotic and eccentric, with the grapes tasting so ripe, they have an almost botrytised, apricotty flavor. So it is with this '06, which also brims with grilled pineapple and sweet smoky oak. Best now.",US
2976,US,"If you like lots of smoky vanilla and buttercream on a big, California-ripe Chardonnay that's stuffed with pineapples and mangoes, then this is the wine for you. It's direct and dry and crisp, at a fair price.",US
2977,US,"While subtle on the nose with hints of chamomile and pressed apple aroma, this ripe, full-bodied Chardonnay is concentrated with apple and lemon flavors. It's round in mouthfeel but marked with bright acidity that lends steely precision to the finish.",US
2978,US,"The scent of apple blossoms perfume this round, richly structured wine, accentuating flavors of apple and pear on the palate. Touches of vanilla and cream add weight and mouthfeel, but the wine finishes crisp with lemony acidity and saline minerality.",US
2979,US,A directly appealing wine with little obvious new oak influence to get in the way of the clean pear and pineapple flavors that are stitched together by just a touch of sweetness.,US
2980,US,"Crisp and spicy, with oak and lees influences, yet lacking a bit in fruity concentration. With one-fifth Pinot Gris, the wine shows modest citrus, apple and floral flavors.",US
2981,US,"Shows rich flavors and a creamy texture, with pineapple-infused crème brûlée, buttered cinnamon bun and honey. Could be more focused and crisper in structure.",US
2982,US,"A rush of zippy, fresh fruit and spice aromas recommends this white from New York, offering the kind of clean fruit flavors and minerality that makes this region unique. The wine lacks real complexity and tends toward the austere but the beguiling spice saves the day.",US
2983,US,"A deep golden color and classic Chardonnay fruit and spice aromas, albeit with a touch of sweetness, begin this wine. On the palate, the fruit is fresh and good but lacks the layering and grounding that oak should offer. Overall it's a good everyday wine that just needs a touch of class to round out the rough edges; food may be the key.",US
2984,US,"This Chardonnay is creamy and scented with vanilla, ripe apple and pineapple. The fruit has a slightly overripe quality, a suggestion of funk on the finish, and the vanilla seems artificial. It says unoaked, but that's a lot of vanilla nonetheless.",US
2985,US,"A subtle nose of butter and spice leads this wine whose flavors are varietally correct but not terribly inspired. The fruit is balanced and round but the finish slightly watery. Not a bad everyday sip, but needs complexity.",US
2986,US,"The dryness and minerality of this wine, combined with its clean, brisk elegance, make it a very nice partner for shellfish. The flavors are lemons, limes, and ripe, crisp white peaches.",US
2987,US,"This is a big wine, and not really showing its best now. It's raw-boned. The oak is all smoky and spicy and dominant; the fruit is massive in pears, crunchy apples and pineapples; the acidity on the finish is tart. It needs a year or so to knit together.",US
2988,US,"Minerals, acidity and sweet green argula give a tangy tinge to the underlying citrus fruit in this dry, structured wine. Fans of big, fat Chards will find it austere, but those valuing elegance will call it Chablisian.",US
2989,US,"This immature Chard needs some time in the bottle for the rich acids and forward oak to knit together with the tremendous wealth of tropical fruit. Give it until 2008, by which time it should provide opulent pleasure.",US
2990,US,"Absolutely beautiful, one of the best unoaked Chardonnays on the market. Brims with bright, clean flavors of pineapples, limes and kiwis, along with vanilla and a touch of cinnamon spice. With its brisk scour of acidity, it's a super-drinkable wine.",US
2991,US,"A nice, lush Chardonnay. It lacks a bit of exciting structure, and depends too much on sheer dazzle. But it sure is rich in toasty oak-inspired pineapples, peaches, pears and limes. Good now with grilled shrimp.",US
2992,US,"Shows lots of dryness and austerity, with acidity, minerals and herbs accompanying the citrus and oak flavors. Not a flamboyant Chardonnay, but a controlled one that offers complexity. A good companion to fresh crab, with buttery garlic bread.",US
2993,US,"Sweet in smoky oak, with sweet cream flavors, this pleasant Chardonnay is rich in pineapples. Yet it's dry, with a minerally tang and fine acidity. Drink now.",US
2994,US,"Rich and creamy, with fruit-forward flavors of pineapple jam, oranges, ripe peaches, vanilla and buttered toast. Crisp acidity gives balance and clean liveliness.",US
2995,US,"This Chard is so rich in tropical fruit, green apple, lime, nectarine, orange, honey and vanilla flavors that it simply doesn't need any oak. With a fine burst of acidity, it provides plenty of drinking pleasure.",US
2996,US,"Fresh and herbaceous, but concentrated with youthful apple and pear flavors, this elegantly balanced, full-bodied wine offers wide appeal. Refreshing and quaffable, it finishes briskly with a stream of lemony acidity.",US
2997,US,"A whiff of floral potpourri that persists from start to finish adds elegance to this full-bodied wine. The palate is expansive and rich, but finishes refreshingly tart with flavors of crisp green apple and lemon.",US
2998,US,"Extend aging in Russian oak lends a smoky, earthy intensity to fresh apple and pear notes on this medium-bodied wine. The palate is unabashedly oaky, but appealing with a rich, creamy tone reminiscent of salted caramels. Soft acidity lends balance, along with a hint of astringency that pulls the finish together.",US
2999,US,"A nose of clean citrus and spice leads on this simple but likeable Chardonnay. On the palate, it offers more of the fresh flavors and the finish is crisp. A nice wine with seafood and salad, and a good choice for fans of lively whites.",US
3000,US,"A fresh, fruity nose with hints of spice lend an alluring start to this Chardonnay, but on the palate, flavors run a little thin.  That said, an appealing toasted oak spice character adds dimension.",US
3001,US,"Soft, subtle flavors of classic Chardonnay mingle with warming spice in this friendly but simple white. Pair with salad or seafood.",US
3002,US,"This friendly, likeable wine offers approachable, slightly sweet flavors—fruity and fresh—that are not complex but will pair well with food.",US
3003,US,"Simple and superoaky, with strong flavors of vanilla and char dominating an otherwise average Chard. Under all that smoky wood you'll find a wine of modest peach, pineapple and apricot flavors.",US
3004,US,"Dry, oaky and tart in citrus and tropical fruits, this Chard teeters on the edge of everyday drinkability and white tablecloth sophistication. The layers of buttercream, crème brûlée and vanilla custard tilt the balance toward elegance.",US
3005,US,"This is quite consistent with the 2004 in terms of style, showing lots of vanilla-laced bourbon barrel, spice and buttered nuts in a tight, stylish frame. The alcohol is just over 14%; the wine is ripe, full, with a mix of citrus and green apple flavors, fresh, crisp and penetrating. It could age for another 5–6 years, as per a good village Burgundy.",US
3006,US,"A nice Chardonnay that shows ripe pineapple, green apple and pear flavors, with added smoky richness from oak, and the finish is dry and crisp. A good price for a wine of this quality.",US
3007,US,"A bit overt in oak, with vanilla and buttered toast aromas and flavors dominating. But you'll also find rich, flamboyant notes of pineapples, kiwi fruit and limes. Fancy and elegant, with broad restaurant appeal.",US
3008,US,"This is from 30-year-old Wente clone vines, a crisply elegant, almost all stainless-fermented Chardonnay with a tight structure, underlying minerality and a zesty, lime-inflected flavor.",France
3009,US,"The fruit stars in this tasty Chardonnay. Pineapples, pears, mangoes, green apples and Key lime pie dance on the palate. A touch of oak adds vanilla cream and buttered toast. Drink now.",US
3010,US,"There's an earthiness to this Chard, reminiscent of sweet fresh sage, along with savory flavors of oranges, pineapples and vanilla. It's a nice, easy wine for drinking now.",US
3011,US,"Way too oaky, with buttered toast, honey and caramel flavors dominating. The underlying wine, which is crisp in acidity and suggests limes, peaches and apricots, just isn't strong enough to handle all that oak.",US
3012,US,"Ripe, fresh peach and apple flavors are lifted with a spray of white-floral perfume on this pretty, easy-going wine. It's brisk on the palate with revitalizing lemon acidity and a hint of salinity on the finish.",US
3013,US,"Soft and simple, with canned apple and pear flavors and a heavy dose of sweet, charry oak.",US
3014,US,"Sweet in oak and simple, with jammy apricot, pineapple and gingerbread flavors.",US
3015,US,"This is a very ripe, fruity Chardonnay, and also a very oaky one. It tastes like apricot brûlée. It will satisfy fans of this California style, but is really fairly simple.",US
3016,US,"There's a lot of crunchy acidity and stony minerality in this Chablis-style Chardonnay. It's got plenty of fruit along the lines of green apples, limes, melons and dates, and is interesting for its sleek architecture.",France
3017,US,"Shows the bright acidity of Carneros, which seems even brighter this cool vintage. That accentuates the lush flavors of puréed pineapples, guavas, nectarines, butterscotch and honey, leading to a long, spicy, rewarding finish. Easy to find, with more than 16,000 cases produced.",US
3018,US,"Dry and crisp, this Chard, which was 100% barrel fermented, has complex flavors of flowers, minerals and citrus fruits, with a rich vein of toasty oak. It's quite elegant and a great food wine. Easy to find, with 19,000 cases produced.",US
3019,US,"A light, subtle nose is followed by simple but elegant Chardonnay flavors and a successful play of oak and acid. The mouthfeel is equally appealing, round and supple. The wine could use more complexity but overall, is enjoyable and will be good with a variety of richer poultry and seafood dishes.",US
3020,US,Nice bright fruit aromas and a lively play of minerality and good fresh fruit make this a definite everyday choice for fans of cleaner whites. The wine is not terribly deep but it's playful and flavorful.,US
3021,US,"This is a wine that takes some time to warm up to—on first sniff there's a somewhat sulfuric, rustic aroma to it. On the palate, a viscous mouthfeel feels a bit heavy, but then there's the fruit, which exhibits good classic Chardonnay flavors and is balanced by elegant oak. A good choice for casual sipping.",US
3022,US,"A rustic but likeable Chardonnay, this offers subtle flavors of oak and fruit in a balanced but somewhat innocuous package. Not much beyond the initial wave of flavors; it wants more complexity and weight.",US
3023,US,"A spicy, tingling nose leads. followed by reserved balance elements of acid, classic Chardonnay fruit and a slatey minerality. Not terribly complex but likeable, and food friendly.",US
3024,US,"Pineapple and spice on the nose are followed by like flavors on the palate. An interplay of acid adds quality to the wine but overall, it lacks dimension and the kind of layering that typifies good Chardonnay.",US
3025,US,"Though found in some Chardonnays, there's a heaviness to this wine, with its orange Muscat nose and syrupy flavors, that seems out of sync here. The wine seems to flop onto the palate and sit there, without much progression. Needs more acid and a lighter touch.",US
3026,US,"Fresh, crisp minerality—a quality that can take a good wine to great heights in the right proportion—seems to hinder this wine. The lack of fruit and oak balance feels tart and thin.",US
3027,US,"Earthy aromas of Chardonnay fruit and toast lead on this wine with a   somewhat prickly character. Lean and simple, it wants more spice and a softer mouthfeel to make it work.",US
3028,US,"Tastes sugared, and the fruit is thin, making the alcohol taste hot.",US
3029,US,"A somewhat candied nose leads, and on the palate, a clumsy sweetness creates a flabbiness over simple fruit that seems unnecessary. Lacks poise but will pair well with cheeses and seafood.",US
3030,US,"This is a creative if not entirely successful wine; its intense, lavish aromas are followed by a surprisingly rustic wave of fruit that has a spin of austerity to it. One-dimensional and rough around the edges.",US
3031,US,"There's an appealing earthiness on the nose and palate, but the overall character is a bit discordant. It has some complexity but not the balance one wants from a Chardonnay.",US
3032,US,"Even people who like lots of buttered toast and smoky vanilla in their Chards might find this one a little over the top. It's a good, rich wine, with lots of bright tropical fruit, but it would score higher if it were just a little less oaky.",US
3033,US,"A lean, steely and slightly herbaceous Chardonnay, whose brisk elegance makes up for the absence of richness. This Chablis-style wine is marked by minerals and suggestions of lemons and limes, as well as strong acidity. Calls for fresh crab in the shell, with plenty of drawn butter for dipping.",US
3034,US,"Stainless steel fermented, this pure varietal is bursting with a tasty fruit bowl mix of apple, pineapple, and Meyer lemon. A hint of mint sneaks in, and the acidity brings bracing minerality to the finish.",US
3035,US,"Made without oak, although the wine has a tart leanness that would have benefited from a little barrel exposure. Nonetheless, it's dry and crisp and minerally, with modest pineapple, Meyer lemon and flower flavors.",US
3036,US,"A creamy texture houses vivid flavors of pineapple jam, lemon pie, vanilla custard and buttered toast in this rich wine. It's an opulent Chardonnay made for elegant fare.",US
3037,US,"This Chard is soft and sweet, very ripe in jammy white and yellow fruit flavors, and has a smoky-oak coating. It's made in a style meant to appeal to consumers.",France
3038,US,"Sweet new oak and jammy tropical fruit co-star in this Chard, offering immediate gratification but little complexity or follow-through. Needs a defter, more sensitive hand, especially at this price.",US
3039,US,"Shows the tangy minerality this cool appellation is known for. The pear, green apple, lime and kiwi fruit has a cold metal, almost chalky edge that lends this wine a Chablisian complexity. Bone dry and elegant, it should develop over the next five years.",US
3040,US,"This is forward, fruity and quite ripe and round, with flavors of peach, pear and apricot. The acid is retained, but this is unusually ripe for the vineyard. The peach flavors dominate, nicely accented with hints of cinnamon and toast. Great fruit, good structure, much less new oak. Still quite young and needing time to add nuance, but plenty of power.",US
3041,US,"A full-bodied, richly textured Chardonnay, with toasty, nutty notes accenting melon and pear flavors. Despite about 70% malolactic fermentation, this avoids buttery excess, instead coming across as toasted hazelnuts and whole grain.",US
3042,US,"Inviting, fresh, racy scents mix pineapple, citrus and light tropical fruits. There is an interesting mouthfeel not unlike Sémillon, though none is indicated in the blend. The wine has substantial length and unusual highlights of spice, clove and mint, along with plenty of rich, ripe fruit to hold down the center palate. Not shy at 14.8% alcohol, this is a fine effort from consulting winemaker Charlie Hoppes.",US
3043,US,"Good price for an upscale Chardonnay this rich and interesting. It's oaky, with vanilla and buttered toast flavors, but the underlying pineapple and Meyer lemon fruit easily supports the wood, while brisk, refreshing acidity provides balance.",US
3044,US,"A flamboyant Chardonnay. Shows flashy scents of vanilla and buttered toast from oak, riding high over pineapple, pear, golden mango and nectarine fruit. Crisp acidity provides needed balance to the richness. Good price for the quality.",US
3045,US,"A dry, streamlined wine, for those who don't like super-fruity, oaky ones. With a streak of minerals, it shows an elegant structure framing citrus, melon and peach flavors.",US
3046,US,"This wine is rich in tropical fruit, pear, green apple and lemon-lime flavors, but dry, with a touch of butterscotchy oak. Shows a deftly clean mouthfeel with fine, coastal acidity.",US
3047,US,"They put all the bells and whistles into this wine, from new oak to sur lie aging. It shows in the creamy depth, yet the wine has an herbaceous, green peppercorn edge. It wants to be fruitier and richer than it is.",US
3048,US,"Pretty good everyday Chard, with a lemon twist and datenut bread edge to the peaches and cream flavors. Finishes with a touch of honeyed sweetness.",US
3049,US,There's something sharp and vegetal to this wine despite a generous helping of sweet oak.,US
3050,US,Nothing going on in this deficient wine except alcohol. Not a trace of fruit.,US
3051,US,"Made mainly from vineyards in Green Valley, the wine was barrel fermented and underwent complete malolactic fermentation. The French oak barrels were 50% new. This level of intervention was appropriate to the underlying wine, which is massive in tropical fruit, pear, fig and melon flavors. The result is complex and lush.",US
3052,US,"Actually a Blanc de Blancs, since it's 100% Chardonnay, this is a wine of great purity, maybe because of the organic grapes. The bread dough, vanilla and subtle peach flavors have a very rich, creamy texture, without the jaggedness of ordinary bubblies. This is an important new addition to California's sparkling wine portfolio.",US
3053,US,"Ripe and oaky, with powerful tropical fruit, candied pear, peach, apricot jam and pineapple custard flavors. Nice acidity balances the earthiness and makes the finish clean and lively.",US
3054,US,"Against a background of dusty earth and herbs, there's bright peach, pear and pineapple flavors and a rich tangerine streak that meshes with the sweet new oak. It's all on the surface, but what a deliciously polished surface it is.",US
3055,US,"Shows brisk acidity for this warmish appellation, with upfront, pineapple custard, peach tart and apricot cobbler flavors wrapped in a honeyed mouthfeel. Just when you think it's a simple Chard, it reveals all kinds of layers.",US
3056,US,"Made from three different appellations, this Chardonnay's cool-climate origins show in the citrusy acidity and rich, tropical fruit flavors that suggest guava and mango. There's also some toasty oak in this tasty wine.",US
3057,US,"The only criticism I have is excessive new oak. In this case, it's 100%, and the sweet char, smoky vanilla and brûléed butterscotch flavors completely dominate. Good as Beringer's top Chards are, they're not Montrachet, and the wine simply cannot shoulder that burden of wood. Having said that, it's still an elegant wine, and oak devotees will love it.",US
3058,US,"Dry on the finish, but lush in smoky oak and pineapple meringue and custard flavors, this is a rich, flamboyant Chardonnay to drink now.",US
3059,US,"Lemony, light-bodied, bone dry and acidically crisp, its citrus and mineral flavors are easy and elegant, and will play well against shrimp scampi.",US
3060,US,"This isn't the most sophisticated wine out there, but at this price, it's not bad. Semidry and smooth in texture, it has modest peach and smoky oak flavors that will satisfy Chard fans.",US
3061,US,"There's an ashy, burnt aspect of this wine that's probably from overly toasted wood, and it dominates the aroma and taste. It's not a bad wine, and has no technical defects, but it's like drinking toothpicks.",France
3062,US,"Not much going on fruit-wise in this lean, but clean, brisk wine. Oak stars, with charry caramel and vanilla overpowering the modest peach and apricot flavors.",US
3063,US,"A controversial wine with our panel. Some loved it for its idiosyncratic aromas and thick, unctuous mouthfeel, while others penalized it for the same characteristics. One reviewer's complex, hard-to-describe aroma was canceled out by another's earthy, mulchy scents. There is a solid core of peach and pineapple fruit, so on balance, our rating is positive.",US
3064,US,"Chardonnay rarely rises above the mundane, but when it does, you wonder why doesn't everyone make it like this? Big and voluptuous, this gorgeous bottling retains enough acid and balance to deliver the big-time goods with finesse. Silky, ripe, lush yet sculpted, it plays out deliciously through an extremely long and richly fruity palate.",France
3065,US,"Immediately likeable for its direct, ripe flavors of candied peaches, kiwis, limes and pineapples. It has just the right acidity and a creamy texture.",US
3066,US,"This wine in a box is made using a faucet technology just like your sink, which feels weird, but it's easy to use and keeps the wine sound. The wine itself is serviceable, with sweet, candied flavors of pineapple and lemon Lifesavers.",US
3067,US,"This is a tightly wound Chardonnay, crisp and steely. It's also oaky. The underlying flavors are of citrus and tropical fruits, buttered toast and vanilla, with a touch of metallic stone. Calls to mind the 2006. Give it a breath of air before serving to soften it, and don't drink it too cold.",US
3068,US,"If there's any oak on this wine, it doesn't show. Instead, it brims with ripe, pure flavors of pineapples, kiwi fruit, limes and cinnamon spice. Crisp and bright.",US
3069,US,"With too much oak and too sweet fruit, the result is an unbalanced Chardonnay. It tastes like LifeSaver lemon candies cooked into a baked Alaska dessert.",US
3070,US,"A sweet edge of sugar lines the fruit on this Chard, making the tangerine, peach, pineapple and oak flavors taste more like a dessert wine than of a dry table wine. In its favor, the wine is crisp and clean.",US
3071,US,"Not a real success for this often good bottling, spoiled by a taste of burnt wood. The oak doesn't taste quite natural; like something synthetic, almost medicinal.",US
3072,US,"A well-behaved Chard with a streak of minerality that uplifts the apple and peach flavors, as well as lees and oak. Finishes a bit rough and earthy, with tobacco leaf acidity.",US
3073,US,"I tasted this alongside a Chard costing more than twice as much, and it held its own. The fruit, acids, oak, spice and creamy texture come together in an appealingly balanced package. Finishes dry, long and complex, but just a tad thin.",US
3074,US,"You want pure Monterey Chardonnay? Go here. It's all about peaches, apricots, pineapples, limes and kiwis, not to mention fresh crisp acidity. Where all that cream came from is a mystery, given that the wine is unoaked. Good wine, good price.",US
3075,US,"Napa Cabs can suffer from a soft earthiness, but El Molino has succeeded in producing a wine of real substance and style. It shows fine pear, apple and nut bread flavors, along with a figgy, raisiny quality, and has good enough acidity for balance. The finish is very dry. This complex wine should age well over the next five years.",US
3076,US,"Wonderfully leesy and complex, the second vintage of the top-of-the-line Ethos Chardonnay has intriguing streaks of orange peel and citrus zest, along with buttered nuts, toast and hazelnut flavors. All the different elements are threaded through the palate and continue into the long, silky finish. The only off notes, perhaps due to the youth of the wine, are some high-toned volatile scents and a bit of alcoholic heat in the back of the palate.",US
3077,US,"I love this Chard for its bright, brisk acidity that fires up the palate, only to reward it with ripe, delicious flavors of Key lime pie, kiwi and pineapple. Oak adds notes of buttered toast and vanilla. The result is rich, refined and complex, a Chardonnay to linger over. Easy to find, with 17,000 cases produced.",US
3078,US,"The combination of brisk acidity and perfectly ripened kiwi, tangerine and papaya fruit makes for one beautiful Chardonnay. Oak adds smoky, vanilla and buttered toast notes. The result is a captivating wine, rich and elegantly tailored.",US
3079,US,"All of this is barrel-fermented, 45% in new French oak, and it shows in the toasty, nutty scents. Buttery and creamy on the palate, with a plump mouthfeel and layered flavors of ripe pears and dried spices. Long and pineapple-y on the finish.",US
3080,US,"This cool Central Coast wine has tropical fruit and lemondrop  flavors as well as zesty acidity. Veteran winemaker Chuck Ortman has added a substantial amount of toasted oak. The result is a clean, flavorful wine.",US
3081,US,"The honeyed richness just oozes out from this dry wine. You can almost picture the freshly crushed grapes in their steel fermenters, it's that fresh and keen in pineapple, tangerine, kiwi, guava and other spicy, acid-rich tropical fruits. Absolutely luscious, a complex, fruit-driven wine of great sophistication and elegance.",US
3082,US,"Great price for a Chardonnay of this quality. The grapes come from cool coastal areas, and the wine brims with crisp, long hangtime ripeness, accented with toasty oak. Feels rich and creamy, with pineapple, tropical fruit and vanilla flavors.",US
3083,US,"Crisp in acidity, with ripe flavors of pineapple jam, apricots and sweet spicy oak.",US
3084,US,"Made in the softly ripe, oaky style, this Chard shows flavors of pineapple cream, lemon zest, vanilla custard and cinnamon spice. It's a crowd pleaser.",US
3085,US,"Massive, complex, with amazing depth, an opulent, voluptuous wine of tremendous power and authority. It's so beautiful now, you almost hesitate to cellar it, but these Hanzell Chards are built for the long haul. Positively volcanic in tropical fruit and toasty new oak, with a honeyed, caramel finish. Absolutely stunning.",US
3086,US,"This is a dramatically structured Chardonnay, a finely balanced wine from Alexander Valley, which produces lush, exotic Chards. The warmth of the vintage has softened the acidity, and while it's not an ager, it's enormously complex. Papaya, mango, crystalized ginger candy and cinnamon spice flavors are long and deep, while extensive new oak adds luscious butterscotch and caramel notes.",US
3087,US,"Spectacularly ripe, showing an explosion of near-perfect fruit and smoky oak, balanced by crisply elegant acidity. Among the top ranks of Carneros Chards, the wine comes from manicured, low-yielding vines that, in this warm vintage, offer pineapple custard, lemon meringue, kiwi, crème brûlée and vanilla spice flavors. There's something keenly firm and stony in the finish.",US
3088,US,"Silhouette typically is held back a little longer than most Chards, which seems to soften it slightly. Still, the '03 is as fresh and pure in fruit as a young wine. It brims with ripe green apple butter, pineapple custard, butterscotch and spicy rum flavors that are well-oaked, and has none of the herbaceousness that often marks Napa Valley Chardonnay. Drink now–2009.",US
3089,US,"Tasted alongside Ramey's Hudson bottling, this one's distinctly different, a softer, creamier, fleshier wine, but no less compelling. From the Napa side of the appellation, the wine is fat and oily in peach custard, butter-and-Cognac-sautéed pineapple and vanilla bean flavors, and while the charred oak is notable, it's fully in keeping with the wine's power.",US
3090,US,"I like this smooth, dry wine, although it's rather overworked. The oak and lees are a bit obvious, yet the papaya and peach fruit flavors, and the acidity, are powerful enough to make it all work.",US
3091,US,"Compared to the winery's Starr Ridge Chard from the same vintage, this is unassertive. It's thicker in the mouth, and softer, with a malted, custard texture framing peach flavors.",US
3092,US,"This isn't one of your tropical fruit and oak, acidic cool-climate monster Chards. It's soft and earthy, with a dried sage and oregano edge to the green apple and white peach flavors.",US
3093,US,"Nice peach and apple pie flavors, along with fresher honeydew define this friendly, soft, somewhat earthy wine. A bit of lees and oak and complexity.",US
3094,US,"There's a lot going on in this complex Chardonnay. The balance strikes you first, with crisp, zesty acidity cleansing the palate and preparing it for the onslaught of flavor. Then a tsunami of grilled pineapples, Meyer lemon pie filling, crème brûlée, butterscotch and vanilla hits. So devastatingly good, you can't keep your hands off it.",US
3095,US,"An exceptional value, this is buttery and round, loaded with peaches and creamy vanilla flavors. Solidly mainstream and quite delicious in a full-on, barrel-fermented, 100% malolactic style.",US
3096,US,"Very, very sweet in residual sugar, with powerful flavors of apricots, honey, oranges and vanilla. A bit soft, but the luscious sweetness is what makes it work.",US
3097,US,"This pleasant wine shows all the usual Chardonnay features of well-ripened tropical fruit and peach flavors, toasty oak, and a creamy, buttery mouthfeel. It's clean and brisk, with a long, fruity finish.",US
3098,US,"You'll find some tasty apricots, peach and vanilla-oak flavors in this soft, creamy wine. It's a nice California Chardonnay, slightly sweet in the finish, and a great accompaniment to salmon or pork.",US
3099,US,"This wine shows those crisp, bright, mouthwatering Central Coast acids. They perk up the lime and tropical fruit flavors enhanced with a touch of vanilla and smoke from barrels. Finishes spicy and dry.",US
3100,US,"There's a lot of Chard character here, in the flavors of peaches, pears, Asian spices, buttery toast and cream. A large proportion of the grapes came from Monterey, which also helps explain the crispness.",US
3101,US,". If you're familiar with the lush, complex Chards from Robert Young, this will ring a bell. It's layered in ripe mango, guava, nectarine, peach and smoky, caramelized oak flavors, with an exotic taste of butter-sautéed bananas. All that flavor is nicely balanced by rich, lemony acidity.",US
3102,US,"Lime-peel acidity marks this bone-dry, tart wine. The other flavors include steely minerals, pineapple crème brûlée and buttered toast. Drink now.",US
3103,US,"Completely barrel-fermented, and it shows in the wine's lavish oak, ample weight and rich, oily texture. It's nutty and leesy, and much less overtly fruity than the winery's Russian River bottling, instead focusing more on weight and texture.",US
3104,US,"A round and pleasant wine with melon, toast and pear aromas and flavors, but a bit on the sweet side. Bright citrus and peach notes add interest, a touch of chalk keeps the sweetness in check, and the oak comes up dramatically on the back end.",US
3105,US,"Clean, minerally and streamlined, with citrus zest, lees, oak flavors and a very dry finish. This will go well with shellfish. It's made in Mondavi's restrained, elegant style.",US
3106,US,"Rich in apricot, peach and pineapple flavors that finish a little sweet and oaky. This is the kind of inexpensive Chardonnay that California so effortlessly produces, all to the benefit of consumers.",US
3107,US,"Clean, dry and tart in acids, this is a minerally Chard with citrus and kiwi flavors. It has some oak that adds richness, but it's not really a rich wine. It's more of a streamlined, sleek sipper.",US
3108,US,"Nice and crisp in acidity, with ripe peach, apple and pineapple flavors. There's a bite of green sharpness on the finish, but it's still a good Chard.",US
3109,US,"Another unoaked Chard hits the market, and with good results at a good price. Nothing but juicy peach, pear and pineapple flavors and crisp acidity. Oak probably would have brought it down.",US
3110,US,"Grown in the warmest part of the appellation, this Chard is soft and without the acidity you find closer to the ocean. But it's a very tasty wine brimming with tropical fruit, honeysuckle, buttered toast and vanilla flavors.",US
3111,US,"Here's a nice everyday sort of Chard, forward in bright lime, kiwi and nectarine flavors. Tastes like it comes from a far cooler climate than Paso Robles. A bit more concentration would send the score through the roof.",US
3112,US,"Flamboyant tropical fruit flavors star in this polished, likeable wine. Pineapples, mangos, melons, peaches and spicy pears, with a dollop of vanilla and buttered toast, all in a creamy texture.",US
3113,US,"Joins very ripe, tropical fruits (like guavas and papayas) to vanilla-tinged, smoky oak to produce a likeable, flavorful Chard. Has a rich, almost thick, creamy texture that finishes with a swirl of spices.",US
3114,US,"Very dry and acidic, this elegant Chard has a tangy minerality that undergirds the lime, kiwi and mango flavors. It's a bone-dry wine, perfect for roasted salmon, chicken or pork with a tropical fruit, green onion and cilantro salsa topping.",US
3115,US,"Christophe Paubert brings a distinctly French palate to these grapes, and he knows how to bring out the elegance that is too often buried in buttery oak. Here the fruit stands out, crisply defined, clean and extremely fresh. Only 20% was put through malo, and fully 85% was fermented in stainless steel. This is a fine effort, and a terrific value.",US
3116,US,"Toastier and more buttery than the 2005, with a touch of warmth to its flavors. Grilled nuts accent melon and ripe peach flavors, showing a greater degree of ripeness than the more refined 2005. Finishes with notes of toasted oak and coffee.",US
3117,US,"Strongly minerally, with a cold metal, chalky tang to the buttery, tropical fruit flavors. With a crisp dose of acidity, this is a dry, elegant Chardonnay that will hold well for five years.",US
3118,US,"Over the years Mondavi's Reserve has taken a turn toward Chablis. Fans of lush, superripe Chards will find it tart, but it's really balanced and elegant. With a dry tang of minerals, it shows bright Meyer lemon, lime, pineapple and white peach flavors. One-third new oak adds creamy, smoky vanilla complexities. Should develop over the next six years.",US
3119,US,"All Milbrandt fruit has created a sappy, buttery and bright Washington Chardonnay. It bursts upon the palate with a beautiful mix of tropical fruits and caramel. Flavors are rich, persistent and lush. You want more long after the bottle has been drained.",US
3120,US,"Crisp and direct, showing bright, flamboyant pineapples, kiwis, figs, Meyer lemons and vanilla.",US
3121,US,"This Paso Robles-based winery has reached into cool-climate Edna Valley for their Chardonnay, with good results. The wine has good acidity and is dry and minerally, with citrus fruit flavors. Try with cracked crab and a well-buttered sourdough baguette.",US
3122,US,"Big, oaky and extremely bright, with refreshing acids and crisply defined fruit. As is usually the case with this spectacular vineyard, the flavors carry extra intensity; they seem to drill down into the heart of the palate. Though released young, this is a wine that could certainly benefit from another 6–12 months in the bottle.",US
3123,US,"Another interesting Chard from this Santa Lucia Highlands estate; why the Wagners don't put that appellation on the label is a mystery. The wine seems even higher in acidity than usual, with greater ageworthiness, and experience shows this is one for the cellar. The tropical fruit flavors are well oaked, and finish absolutely dry. Best after 2008.",US
3124,US,"This shows the ripe tropical fruit of a fine vintage, yet maintains the keen citrusy acidity that makes this vineyard's Chards so balanced and ageworthy. Beneath the pineapple marmalade, apricot and caramelly oak flavors is a rich, flinty minerality that cries out for lobster.",US
3125,US,"Here's a seriously good Chardonnay that fruit lovers will covet, but it's also enormously oaky. I like all that new French wood because the caramelly, smoky vanilla and buttered toast, which is boosted by total malolactic fermentation, works so well with the mangoes, papayas and pineapples. But I know people who would call this Chard toothpicky.",US
3126,US,"This Hommage upholds the tradition for its ripe fruit and firm, dry structure. Tropical fruits, nectarines, apricots, peaches and toasty oak lead to a long, spicy, complex finish.",US
3127,US,"Gainey's Limited Selection Chard has been a remarkably consistent wine, hanging onto its minerally rich Santa Rita character through vintage variations. The '04 retains the wine's sleek elegance, rich without being heavy, offering a wealth of tropical fruit, limestone and new oak flavors.",US
3128,US,"Partially barrel-fermented, this Chard is a blend of Bien Nacido and Solomon Hills. It's a heavyweight, so full-bodied, in fact, that it's one of the rare California Chardonnays that will benefit from bottle age. It has a candied, English dessert trifle flavor of apricots, peaches, citrons and green apples, baked into a custardy pudding, and the caramelized taste of charred oak. You'll even find a dusting of tannins. Best after 2007, and for another five to seven years.",US
3129,US,The understated pear and pineapple flavors of this medium- weight Chardonnay have pleasant spice accents. It finishes stylishly with slightly tart pineapple and citrus notes.,US
3130,US,"This wine's deep gold color is in line with its ripe-apple and butterscotch flavors. There's plenty of oak, and a round mouthfeel. Sophisticated palates may find this package just too obvious, but tangy oak over overtly sweet fruit is a bulls-eye if you're not seeking nuance.",US
3131,US,"Despite its relative youth, this Virgina-made sparkler is pungently toasty on the nose, then moves into green apple and lime flavors. It does show its dosage a little, but finishes with decent flourishes of smoke, toast and citrus.",US
3132,US,"Shows richness in the ripe peach, pear and apple flavors, although the wine, from Yountville and Oak Knoll, is a little soft and earthy compared to cool-climate Chards. Dry and clean.",US
3133,US,"Dry, bright in acids, and fruity, with kiwi and lime flavors that finish with a spicy flourish. This is a nicely elegant Chard that won't break the bank.",US
3134,US,"As tart in acids and zingy as cool-climate Chard comes, with bright, mouth-stimulating lime and kiwi flavors that finish dry and clean. There's a tiny bit of oak, but the fruit really stars in this tasty, affordable wine.",US
3135,US,"A lush Chardonnay marked by the integrated balance of all its parts, resulting in great harmony. It's very ripe in tropical fruits and quite oaky and leesy, but like the powerful gymnasts at Cirque du Soleil, all the performers work together as a troupe. Drink with rich, fancy fare, like lobster or scallops.",US
3136,US,"Strong in every sense, with ripe pineapple, lemon and peach flavors and strong oak. Lacks subtlety, but it's crisp in acidity and shows a nice streak of minerals. Ready now.",US
3137,US,"From the old vine planting, this is a thick, chunky, fruity style, with banana and light tropical fruit flavors. Firm acidity and grip give it a substantial mouthfeel.",US
3138,US,"This is a big, rich, showy Chardonnay. Barrel fermented and aged in 80% new French oak, it shows buttered toast and charry vanilla bean aromas and flavors. The fruit below is good, if a little heavy and ripe, suggesting apricots and pears. Best now in its youth.",US
3139,US,"Here's a good, rich and super-drinkable Chardonnay. It shows oak-inspired flavors of pineapples, peaches and green apples that taste like they were baked into a pie. Finishes clean and zesty in acidity.",US
3140,US,"Very rich, creamy and oaky, made in the ripe, California style of Chardonnay. Brims with buttered toast, vanilla cream, and caramelized wood aromas and flavors riding over underlying pineapples, pears and limes. Flamboyant, if a little top-heavy. Ready now.",US
3141,US,"This is a thoroughly modern style: 100% French oak, Dijon Clone 75, plenty of lees contact. The yeasty nose introduces a very rich, mouthcoating sensation of butterscotch. Those leesy, creamy, butterscotch flavors surround the palate; the green apple fruit carries a bit of crisp authority and keeps the structure firm. Long, smooth and very sensual without being too tiring.",US
3142,US,"The source of dependably rich Chards, Rosella's has given Bernardus the opportunity to craft a wonderfully complex wine. It's ripe in flavors ranging from lime tart and kiwi to papaya, nectarine and Anjou pear. Delicious, although it would benefit from higher acidity.",US
3143,US,"Yet another outstanding effort from Rulo, this  appealing Chardonnay marries pretty peach flavors to a mix of spices from 100% French oak barrel fermentation. Cinnamon and other Asian spices, along with barrel toast, provide a nice counterpoint to the ripe fruit.",US
3144,US,"Quite different from Spelletich's Spotted Owl release, this wine has spiced green-apple aromas. While it's as rich in flavor as the other offering, the acidity is lower, so the wine seems softer and creamier.",US
3145,US,"Cream and honey aromas highlight this juicy, fleshy wine. With its buttery texture and slightly sweet fruit flavors, it's about pleasure, not complexity, and it finishes long and spicy.",US
3146,US,"Subtle citrus and peach aromas mark this pretty wine, with light oak shadings. It's round and supple, with some nicely extracted citrus fruit and crisp acidity. It's light and elegant, but no blockbuster.",US
3147,US,"This Sonoma County Chardonnay is a mainstream success, with ripe, peachy fruit, leesy notes and not that much oak. It finishes dry, clean and crisp, with a slight bitter-almond note.",US
3148,US,"Nice and rich in toasty oak, framing mouthfilling flavors of pineapples, papaya, peach and cinnamon spice. Feels creamy-smooth, with a good tang of acidity.",US
3149,US,"Crisp and dry, a minerally wine with earthy, citrus flavors and a firm structure. For a little richness, there's a streak of peach on the finish.",US
3150,US,"This new vintage of Novelty Hill's estate Chardonnay shows more acid and spice than the slightly richer, creamier 2005, but offers the same superb winemaking. The fruit is a perfect mix of apple, pear, passion fruit and green banana, laced with cinnamon and sweet baking spices. This is that all-too-rare, affordably-priced domestic Chardonnay. It does not require food to “fill in” what's missing—nothing is missing!",US
3151,US,"A very tasty, fruity, slightly sweet style It's front-loaded and fruit-loaded, but good value and good taste.",US
3152,US,"A very nice cocktail wine for its dryness and crispness. Although it's Chardonnay, it's not a big, rich wine, but a sleek, bone-dry one, with citrus and mineral flavors and strong acidity. A dash of Viognier adds an exotic, flowery note.",US
3153,US,"Pretty oaky, with vanilla, buttered toast and charred wood aromas and tastes dominating. Under that are grilled pineapples and peaches, balanced with fine, tart acids. A little off around the edges, but a promising Chardonnay grown in this coastal L.A. climate.",US
3154,US,"Vanilla, ripe pear and dry citrus aromas and flavors highlight this featherbed of a wine. The palate's soft, almost sappy feel, round melon fruit and mild spices are easy to like. It's not cloying or tacky, just don't look for spine or structure.",US
3155,US,Lime and other citrus fruits predominate in this lean and tangy wine that's a refreshing relief to the multitude of oversugared and overoaked wines in this category. There's a faint spritz on the palate and the citrus profile makes up for slightly low acidity. Finishes mild and even.,France
3156,US,"The pineapple and Golden Delicious aromas are right on target, and are followed by apple and mildly oaky flavors. An easy texture and smooth finish with mild spice notes close this crowdpleaser.",US
3157,US,"This wine has a flinty, minerally personality, with a full  overlay of toasty oak. Don't look for fat, blockbuster fruit here—the flavors tend toward lime and tangerine. The oak adds caramel, vanilla and smoky notes. It's supple in the mouth but closes strangely flat.",US
3158,US,"Direct, with smoky oak-infused flavors of ultra-ripe pineapples, oranges, pears and honeysuckle. Very bright acidity makes it mouthwatering.",US
3159,US,"Missing the lushness of the Goodchild Chard, but still a clean, tasty wine showing pineapple and toasty oak flavors. Easy to savor with its zesty acidity.",US
3160,US,"Okay everyday Chard, with toned-down peach, pear and oak flavors and a creaminess to the texture. Finishes dry, crisp and short.",US
3161,US,"Clean and tasty, this crisp, dry Chard has modest peach, apple and tropical fruit flavors. It's a nice country wine at a fair price.",US
3162,US,"The vineyard is in inland Hopland, and the wine has that warm-climate fruitiness. It shows tremendous peach, apricot, pineapple and pear flavors, with a slightly rustic, sweet finish.",US
3163,US,"Ripe and juicy in mango, pineapple and pear flavors, with a generous dollop of toasty oak and a vanilla cream texture. Finishes a bit sharp in acidity, but refreshing and tasty.",US
3164,US,"Tight and lemony, with firm acids that make the tastebuds whistle. This is a dry Chard well suited to crab dishes.",US
3165,US,"The wine is still showing a lot of rich new oak flavors: toast, coconut and vanilla crème. Sur lie aging (in 100% French oak) adds plenty of texture and the impression of minerality. Behind the oak is a lush mix of fruits, from tangerine and pineapple through papaya and ripe banana.",US
3166,US,"Easily the best Chard from Stevenot I've tasted, for the quality of the structure. The wine is very dry and crisp, with mineral, lime, pink grapefruit and dried herb flavors. A great food wine.",France
3167,US,"Apple and pear, cracker and citrus, pineapple and a hint of residual sugar combine in a soundly made, all-purpose Chardonnay. The alcohol is just under 13%, and the wine was not put through malolactic fermentation, leaving it crisp and fresh.",US
3168,US,This lemony wine boasts modest citrus aromas and flavors coupled with sharp acidity. It has some pretty oak and spice notes.,US
3169,US,"Opens with aromas of peaches, butter cream, vanilla and caramel, then turns fruity and rich in the mouth. It's a bit awkward, as there's a blast of herbs or veggies in the middle palate that doesn't seem to belong.",US
3170,US,"Very ripe, forward fruit characterizes this slightly heavy, somewhat dense wine. It has a kiss of oak and a little sweetness, with good, crisp acidity.",US
3171,US,"Smells citrusy and oaky, with a distinct melon note. This is a simple, somewhat rough wine that expresses the most basic Chardonnay characteristics, but offers little beyond affordability.",US
3172,US,"Begins with aromas of peaches and citrus fruits and a vegetal, herbaceous note. Fruity and rough, with good acidity.",France
3173,US,"A good everyday Chardonnay that shows crisp acidity and the ultra-dryness and cleanliness of a well-made Central Coast Chard. Made for drinking now, with lime, white peach and mineral flavors.",US
3174,US,"This is a regional wine, but don't dismiss it because it doesn't have a vineyard designation. It shows the vibrant acidity of the Highlands, and the long, cool vintage has given exceptionally ripe flavors of pineapples, guavas and passionfruit. Your guests will love it.",US
3175,US,"Nice price, clean wine, and probably unoaked. However, the fruit is kind of thin and watery.",US
3176,US,"Soft and simple, with candied peach and pear flavors and some oaky, leesy influence that makes it a little fancier.",US
3177,US,"Very oaky, with a blast of char and caramel. Under that is light fruit suggesting pineapples and pears, in a creamy texture.",US
3178,US,"Clean, dry and oaky, with modest flavors of peaches and pears, and a good finish. A good value.",US
3179,US,"Simple and earthy, with peach, pear and sweet oak flavors, and a slightly rough mouthfeel. Finishes with an awkward sweetness.",US
3180,US,"Has real Monterey character in the ripe tropical fruits and zesty acidity, only the flavors are a bit thin. If you can find this wine for a few bucks less, it's a real value.",US
3181,US,"Another wine done in a fresh, spicy, bright style. Apple and light cinnamon, crisp and clean, make a wine perfect for summer sipping.",US
3182,US,"Made in the modern, ripe California stlyle, this Chardonnay offers immediately appealing flavors of pineapple jam, peach, lime, kiwi and vanilla oak. It's balanced with crisp acidity. Ready now for sheer richness.",US
3183,US,"With 9% residual sugar, this Chardonnay is distinctly sweet. It's also very Chard-like, with pear, peach and buttercream flavors. It's a bit simple, but very tasty.",US
3184,US,"A very nice, super-drinkable Chardonnay marked by brisk, cool-climate acidity and a bracing minerality. The pineapple, peach and apple flavors have the slight herbality you often find in Napa Chardonnay.",US
3185,US,"This is sensuous Chardonnay that provides plenty of texture and depth without being heavy. The bouquet is robust and complex, with pear, smoke, vanilla, cumin and an appealing oatmeal-graham cracker-like note. A full spectrum of similarly ripe fruit flavors coats the mouth, bolstered by good acidity, and you can almost sink your teeth into the full, chewy mouthfeel. This very impressive bottling finishes long and complex, with grainy pear, spice and buttery notes. Editors' Choice.",US
3186,US,"An intensely fragrant floral, ginger, peach, lemon-lime and orange-spice bouquet ushers in this smooth, well-structured wine. The palate shows intricately meshed orange, butterscotch and toasted nut flavors, offset by angular, racy mineral accents. Finishes long and crisp, with refined pineapple, citrus and stony flavors. Enjoyable now but still tight, this should offer even more in two years.",US
3187,US,"This Napa stalwart is beautifully integrated. Leesy and citrus notes accent the solid apple and toast profile on both the nose and in the mouth. It's big, but displays impeccable balance and a great mouthfeel. Lime and spice play against richer butterscotch, vanilla and toasty elements on the long, handsomely textured finish.",US
3188,US,"There's plenty of ripe fruit in this 1998. An intense nose of coconut, jasmine, sweet pineapple, toasted marshmallow and cloves opens this lush beauty. A lovely, positive tension prevails in the mouth between tropical fruit flavors, pear, apple and citrus elements, all accented by intriguing spice notes. Finishes long, again relying on a fine tension between sweet and tart notes to create a harmonious and sensuous close.",US
3189,US,"Taut and intensely structured, the compact smoke, lime, ginger and nut bouquet here hints at what's within. The mouth offers lime and chalk, vanilla and apples and a creamy yet firm mouthfeel—it's surprisingly full, with bright acidity. The dry, crisp finish with its spicy, toasty flavors has great length, again showing structure and refinement. Will be at its best in two-plus years. Cellar Selection.",US
3190,US,"The flagship of the Peter Michael Chardonnays is a stylish, sexy wine. Opens with a wonderful nose of peach, tropical fruit, nuts and orange tea; it shows great poise and a classic sense of proportion from bouquet to finish. The wine unfolds and expands in the glass, offering lovely orange, mineral and tarragon flavors. The engaging finish has great length and subtle aromas and flavors. Impressive for its restraint and attention to detail, this is delicious now but will also reward keeping. Cellar Selection.",US
3191,US,"One of seven wines we tasted from this renowned vineyard, and one of six from veteran Chard-meister Jed Steele. This one's a beauty—the top scoring wine from both the winemaker and the site. A floral, orange, vanilla custard and almost mustardy-spice nose opens to a full orange, mineral and vanilla-spice palate. It's rich and creamy yet spicy, and even shows some bright lemony elements. This multidimensional wine finishes long with tangy, toasty oak. Top Value.",US
3192,US,"This is everything a flagship wine should be, with its rich mouthfeel, palate-coating flavors and long finish. The flavors are on the apple side of the Chardonnay spectrum, with toasty oak galore, but would you expect otherwise? The long finish has lots of finesse and style despite its considerable heft.",US
3193,US,"This is a seductive pleasure-bomb, with a ripe core of tropical, citrus and banana fruit flavors wrapped in a toasty-oak and butterscotch cocoon. Lush and creamy, it hits all the right notes; as it pushes the ripeness and vanilla envelopes to the max, it does so with great style and balance. The long, toasty, crème brûlée finish has great appeal. Top Value.",US
3194,US,"Ripe orange and papaya, spice, graham cracker and smoke are a few of the adjectives tasters used to describe the nose of this delightful wine. Though rich and open on the palate, it never gets loose or sloppy. A great chalk element and spice accents nicely offset the rich fruit foundation. Buttered toast and nutty, leesy notes mingle with pineapple on the long, finely balanced back end.",US
3195,US,"Full and focused, the nose of orange, crème brûlée and vanilla opens to a handsomely balanced palate of lively citrus, Granny Smith apple and vanilla cream flavors. Moderately plump and pleasing, good underlying acidity here keeps it elegant and maintains fine flavor definition. Butterscotch, lemon and spicy oak flavors mingle on the long finish.Top Value.",US
3196,US,"One of the oldest wines submitted, a deliciously complex créme brûlèe, coconut, nutmeg, vanilla and smoke bouquet opens this classy contender. Full and creamy on the palate, it offers rich, finely nuanced pear and nectarine fruit flavors accented by clove, nutmeg and coconut. Still feels young, finishing long and bold with intriguing spice and tangy pineapple notes.",US
3197,US,"Deep pineapple and orange fruit is wrapped in a deep, toasty oak envelope in this Russian River classic. There are complex nutty, leesy, burnt sugar and even vaguely meaty notes on the nose. These open to a big-bodied but earthy and stony palate where bright, citrusy fruit and vanilla accents also vie for attention. Tightly wound, the burnt-toast and mineral finish is long and tasty, with more vanilla, smoke and apple accents. Top Value.",US
3198,US,"This Chardonnay reads on the nose and palate like key lime pie. Sweet and sour citrus notes are offset by graham cracker, vanilla and ginger snap. This is great juice with plenty of dimension—at once smooth and full, creamy and spicy. Don't drink it for dessert, though—try it with grilled chicken in a citrus and spice marinade. Top Value.",US
3199,US,"A winning nose offers aromas of créme brulée, smoked bacon, pears, peaches and toasty vanilla that just keep coming on in this stylish, full wine. The palate shows similar flavors. The big mouthfeel continues on the long, slightly sweet finish with its toasty, smoky oak. Strong already, but it should be even better in six months. From the maker of the fine affordable and widely available Katherine's Vineyard Chardonnay. Top Value.",US
3200,US,"This wine's fat, tropical fruit, banana and toast nose has a pungent, spicy Gewürztraminer quality. The palate is the payoff. It shows the aforementioned elements, plus cinnamon, clove and vanilla flavors. What you get is a ripe, unctuous wine—big, maybe even a bit overblown, but totally lovable. The long, spicy finish of this unique bottling is impressive.",US
3201,US,"A seductive nose of pineapple, pear, vanilla and buttered toast leads, followed by a nicely knit, well-fruited, but not-at-all sweet palate. Here, pear, melon, pineapple and tangerine is offset by light toast and vanilla accents. Balanced and smoothly textured, it shows graceful restraint that suggests it will improve over the next year or two.",US
3202,US,"Lots of spice along with a veritable fruit cocktail of complex flavors open this understated performer. From green apple and bosc pears to melon and mint, it has an elegant integration of fruit and spicy, vanillin oak. Tangy acidity keeps it lively, and the wine finishes crisp and dry. Still tight, this could use a year to knit itself together.",US
3203,US,"A winning combination of pear, apple, ripe melon and butterscotch flavors, spiked with spicy clove and tart citrus accents. Lavishly oaked for a mid-weight wine, there's sufficient depth of fruit here to support the wood, and the elements mesh and hold nicely. An easy, lush mouthfeel means it's best enjoyed over the next year or so—if you can keep it around that long.",US
3204,US,"This is a big, delicious mèlange of pineapple, pears, buttered popcorn and coconut vying with mineral and toasty oak elements. Fat and friendly, it's got the goods to hold the taster's interest. The “California Cuvée” designation means that it's made of fruit from many places—more proof that good bottles are not all vineyard designates or single AVA wines. Enjoy now and over the next two years.",US
3205,US,"An anise note adds dimension to an already attractive lime, toast, melon and buttery bouquet. With beautiful balance, subtle peach, nut and crème brûlée flavors come together in a very attractive palate. This is as lithe and balanced as a ballerina on pointe. This Rutherford treat has a long, warm and smoky-caramel flavored finish.",US
3206,US,"At 2,523 cases, this is fabled grower Rochioli's largest-production Chardonnay. The bouquet sings with complex roasted nut, pineapple, citrus, toast and banana aromas. Tart apple and anise flavors play off the sweet caramel and vanillin oak to create an elegant balance on the palate. Persistent fruit and smoky accents on the finish—it's hard to resist. Top Value.",US
3207,US,"It's said that Dick Arrowood personally checks every bottle that goes out—his attention to detail shows here. A complex and refined bouquet of toasted oat, coconut, orange and peach opens to a full palate of apple, yellow plum and caramel flavors. Rich and creamily textured, it is also high on spice and smoky oak. The complex finish is very long, leesy and elegantly nuanced.",US
3208,US,"A blend of half barrel-fermented wine with half tank-fermented, this is a ripe, fruit cocktail of a wine, blending tropical fruit with smoke, vanilla and citrus. Soft and easy to drink.",US
3209,US,"Colored a deep green/gold, this thick and viscous Chardonnay is packed with flavors of peach, apricot and tropical stone fruits. It seems Australian in its weight and fruit power, though the acids typical of Washington grapes give it some additional lift. There's just enough oak to provide a nice dusting of spice. Definitely a wine to drink young.",US
3210,US,"Simple, with earthy flavors and thinned-down peaches and apples. There's a little oak. Finishes dry and crisp.",US
3211,US,"Simple, with canned peach and apricot flavors and a slightly sweet finish.",France
3212,US,"Kind of soft and thin, but there's a nice, dry Chardonnay character and enough peaches and cream flavors smoky oak and creamy texture to satisfy.",US
3213,US,"Rough and ready, this is a dry, crisply tart wine with thinned-down citrusy flavors that will do in a pinch.",France
3214,US,"Ripe and juicy, with pineapple, pear, apricot, vanilla and buttered toast flavors. This is a nice everyday Chardonnay. From Talley.",US
3215,US,"The aroma suggests a ton of oak, and that impression carries over to the flavors. Butterscotch, buttered toast, caramel, crème brûlée, they're all tasty, but you don't want them to dominate, and here, they do. The underlying flavors of pineapples are swamped.",US
3216,US,"The underlying wine in Beringer's '05 Reserve is a rich blend of tropical fruit, peach, pear and apple flavors. But the wine is overoaked, with 75% new wood in the barrel fermentation. Anyone sensitive to the taste of new oak will instantly recognize the immense cosmetic of smoky char, sweet vanilla, buttered toast and spicy, sappy wood essence, which seems excessive and not really needed.",US
3217,US,"Very rich and ripe, showing pineapple tart and oak-infused vanilla, meringue and buttered toast aromas and flavors. A bit lacking in structure, though, with a soft, melted mouthfeel. Could be firmer and crisper to balance all that decadence.",US
3218,US,"Long known for their powerful, elegant Chardonnays, Chalk Hill's 1998 offering is impressive for its complex array of aromas and flavors. The toasty, leesy, popcorn elements adorn full, richly nuanced sweet pear, pineapple and peach flavors. A lovely, smooth mouthfeel with a slight granular quality adds texture and interest. This refined wine exudes finesse and refinement.",US
3219,US,"A winning wine that displays a vibrantly fragrant tangerine, citrus and herb-butter bouquet. It opens to a full, dense tropical-fruit palate and shows an almost seamless texture. Tangy oak plays off the lingering fruit nuances on this bottling's lengthy, luxurious finish.",US
3220,US,"One of a back-to-back pair of strong performances from Foley, this wine opens with well-defined herb, caramel and cream nose. Ripe apple and toasted oak flavors round out the rich, buttery palate. The citrus and peach finish goes on forever. Shows complexity, but with a straight-ahead style that make it a real pleaser. Great now.",US
3221,US,"Bob Lindquist's 1999 offering displays a lovely opening of tropical fruit and vanilla custard beneath a smoky veil. The palate's understated nectarine, pear, pineapple flavors are bolstered by firm but not sharp acidity. The mouthfeel is crisp; the wine's fine structure shows through the tangy, nut-pepper finish. Already impressive, but warrants cellaring for two or three years. Top Value.",US
3222,US,"An intoxicating bouquet of clove, ripe orange, peach and melon promises a lot, but this wine delivers. The similarly heady palate of creamy, ripe tropical fruit is almost romantic, the richly textured mouthfeel full and lush. Finishes long in the same sensuous manner. Drink now for its exuberant fruit and voluptuous feel. Like Paul, his wines exude style and character.",US
3223,US,"The ripe bouquet shows rich banana, butter and pineapple aromas. Full-bodied, yet bright with lively acidity, the palate displays bright citrus, butterscotch, pineapple, green plum and vanilla flavors. There's slight heat, but also nice vanilla and citrus notes on the long finish.",US
3224,US,"A seductive nose of pineapple, pear, vanilla and buttered toast leads, followed by a nicely knit, well-fruited, but not-at-all sweet palate. Here, pear, melon, pineapple and tangerine is offset by light toast and vanilla accents. Balanced and smoothly textured, it shows graceful restraint that suggests it will improve over the next year or two.",US
3225,US,"This is a full, round and juicy wine, with pronounced orange, tangerine and pineapple aromas and flavors. Wonderful hints of vanilla and spice accent the bright tangy core of citrus fruit. A wine that's big and packed with fine ripe fruit, but isn't over the top.",US
3226,US,"Bright pear, peach, pineapple, ginger snap and floral notes grace a fresh, fragrant nose. The palate's exotic tropical fruit, ginger and lychee nut flavors mingle beautifully in a medium-full, though perhaps slightly sweet, package. Elegant and appealingly fresh.",US
3227,US,"A very ripe tropical-fruit nose is complemented beautifully by an intense smoky-toasty element. Pineapple, mango and caramel flavors stand out on the full palate: The smoky note resurfaces later, riding out the persistent finish. This is a sleek, stylish, but very solidly built Chardonnay. It pushes all the right sensory buttons, with big body and great lines, like a '56 Buick.",US
3228,US,"Joseph Phelps's flagship Chardonnay is a study in sophisticated style. A fragrant peach, pineapple, smoke and floral bouquet might, in other wines, be overpowering, but here it is subtly seductive. Rich peach, tart orange and oat flavors ride the velvety palate, and the long, suave finish displays tangerine, peaches and cream aromas and flavors. There are layers of nuance to explore here—savor this one slowly.",US
3229,US,"From the orange, creamy buttermilk and earthy notes on the nose to the dry mineral, herb and Asian pear palate, there's much to savor here—such as the balance, proportion and long, citrus-mineral finish. This is a complex and reserved wine, not a conventional, in-your-face bottling. It's rather tight now, but if you give it two years (or more!), you'll be well rewarded.",US
3230,US,"The third vintage of the Beringer senior winemaker's namesake bottling is robust, yet approachable. This wine is lavishly—to some, overly oaked, but it's one of the best of this style. Apple, cinnamon bun, and smoke aromas give way to caramel, vanilla and spice flavors. Add a rich, round mouthfeel, and you've got a very seductive package. This wine is more about vigorous style, flavor and texture than subtlety. Only die-hard anti-oaksters will be able to resist its appeal.",US
3231,US,"Another elegant wine from Cambria. This one has a vanilla, smoke and grapefruit nose. Medium-weight, it is crisp in the mouth, though somewhat leaner than the Bench Break. This cuvée nicely melds green apple fruit with menthol and vanilla accents. The bouquet is a reprise of the long, sweet-tart, butterscotch and tangy oak finish.",US
3232,US,"Crème brûlée creaminess combines with tart citrus fruitiness in this wine, which displays great balance and richness. A nice oak frame holds it all together and provides a handsome framework for the lime-orange-tangerine citrus core. The palate has buttery caramel and wintergreen accents. Long, serene finish.",US
3233,US,"Full and fat with a delightful mix of tropical fruit and new oak spiciness. Both a creamy texture and good acid—a feat in itself—offset nicely the rich pineapple, peach, coconut, clove and exotic spice flavors. Has style, balance and length. Drink this Carneros champ now and over the next two years. Top Value.",US
3234,US,"Best known for their classic Cabernets, this producer has a confident and skilled hand with Chardonnay, too. This is a well-proportioned wine that displays complex apple, lime, vanilla and earthy mineral notes. There's a crisp tautness to the apple fruit and tart citrus acidity that carries on the long, spicy finish. A powerhouse that promises to open up over the next year. Top Value.",US
3235,US,"Taste this wine and you'll agree: It's big. Even fat. A fragrant, buttery apple-floral bouquet opens into a banana, orange and hay palate. The mouthfeel is creamy, round and lively—it's full-flavored without being too weighty. Pear and butterscotch linger on the finish.",US
3236,US,"Aromas of smoke, cream and herbs atop a ripe pineapple foundation. In the mouth, pineapple prevails again along with apple, toast and butterscotch notes. It's supple, and though quite fruit-driven, it's not at all sweet. The wine shows complexity and finishes long and light on its feet. Top Value.",US
3237,US,"Aromas of butter, cream and popcorn are so prevalent on the nose that you'll swear you're at the movies. Popcorn and butter show again on the palate, but here they're teamed up with ripe golden-apple and orange notes. Finishes with pineapple and butter in bold and appealing style. A daring, not gently nuanced, wine.",US
3238,US,"This plush Chardonnay's bouquet shows an ultraripe botrytis note in its vanilla, peach, clove and caramel aromas. Dried fruits, caramel and honey flavors massage the palate: the mouthfeel is full and viscous—even voluptuous. A must for lovers of larger-than-life Chards.",US
3239,US,"A tart pineapple-lemon nose with caramel and smoke accents ushers in a full palate. Apple and pear flavors add body, and a chalky note contributes complexity and texture to the palate. Slight creaminess provides a fat, full feel, but maybe just a bit more softness than some tasters preferred. Still, this is a solid wine with finesse and body. It displays both smoky toast and bright orange-lemon notes on the finish.",US
3240,US,"The graceful, subtle nose of pears, apples and hazelnuts don't prepare you for the richness of this old-guard Napa producer's 1999 offering. A full and intense palate of toast, honey, spice and pineapple comes on strong. The flavors are supported by bright acidity, and they linger on the long and lively finish.",US
3241,US,"Butter and vanilla wrap around tropical fruit and citrus flavors on the full nose. Baked apples, crème caramel and abundant new oak merge to provide this chard with a slightly viscous, buttery texture. Its rich butter and oak may be a bit too much for some. The tangy finish is long and tasty.",US
3242,US,"This appealing Chardonnay is the same wine that carried a reserve designation in prior vintages. It's lushly woven and has aromas and flavors of pear, pineapple and peach. The fruit is rich but not overly sweet, and sports accents of cinnamon and allspice. This balanced, medium-weight wine finishes long and easy with a nice nuttiness. Top Value.",US
3243,US,"A jazzy bouquet of sour pear, toasted nut and leesy notes opens this North Coast winner. An unusual mix of dry orange, papaya and cantaloupe flavors follow on the palate. The medium-full mouthfeel is butter-smooth, yet bright and crisp enough to not be mushy. Spice and lemon accents enliven the long, tangy finish. Top Value.",US
3244,US,"This Napa Valley aristocrat sheds its normally understated demeanor and shows lively, pear, apple and melon fruit plus a vanilla-custard richness. There's toasty oak and a lively acid backbone that will help it evolve over the next few years. It's well-balanced, with a toasty, poised finish that's long and has bright lime overtones.",US
3245,US,"In this fine offering from one of this tasting's most consistent performers, a nutty, pineapple-ginger nose opens to a lively mouth of citrus, hazelnut and spice. The feel is firm, elegant. This handsomely constructed wine finishes long with subtle white peach notes, with dashes of tangy spice and chalk.",US
3246,US,"Well made, with a good mix of green apple and butterscotch, but less weight and density than some of the bigger wines. There's a bit of pineapple fruit also, hints of citrus and judicious use of the oak. The juicy fruit opens into light tropical flavors through the finish.",US
3247,US,"Spicy and brisk, this is a pleasing mix of crisp pear, melon and apple. The barrel time adds flavors of butter, toast and cinnamon, nicely melded. Particularly fine, stylish Chardonnay for the price.",US
3248,US,"Can't recommend this wine because it's just too thin. It's pretty much watery alcohol, with a few drops of Chard essence.",US
3249,US,"Good everyday value in a Chardonnay. Shows a wealth of buttered toast, pineapple, lemondrop and cinnamon flavors, in a creamy texture.",US
3250,US,"Rich and oaky, this Chard has flavors of vanilla custard, caramel, butterscotch, pineapple jam, Meyer lemons and pear tart with the crust. It's a crowd-pleaser that will appeal to legions of Chardonnay lovers.",US
3251,US,"Shows proper Chard character in the peach flavors, oaky overtones and creamy texture. Could use more concentration, though, as it's rather weak on the finish.",US
3252,US,"This is Iron Horse's first foray into native yeast winemaking, and the wine does have a yeasty, leesy quality, in addition to the usual dryness and minerality. In fact, this Chard is a little austere. Try giving it some years in the cellar.",France
3253,US,"Shows classic Edna Valley acidity, upfront and zesty, that stimulates the palate and brightens the modest lime, kiwi and vanilla oak flavors. This is a pleasant, easy Chardonnay to drink now.",US
3254,US,"Ginger snap and graham cracker aromas share the field with golden apple, menthol and lemongrass on the nose. Winemaker Rob Hunter selects the best lots and crafts a tightly-meshed wine with persistence and a strong backbone. Pear, pineapple, vanilla and toasty oak linger on the palate. Has personality and closes with impressive length.",US
3255,US,"Another solid effort from Mondavi, the 1998 reserve shows fine structure and an attractive spectrum of citrus, peach, crème brulée and nut aromas and flavors that work in lovely harmony.  It's full but not heavy, and balances fruit and acidity, sweetness and tartness, and light and full elements. The positive fruit, style and restraint are notable.",US
3256,US,"This is a ripe pear-scented butterscotch-infused Chardonnay. The palate shows more ripe pear and melon flavors, along with lots of toasty new oak, which yields delicious hazelnut shadings. Soft and easy to enjoy, it closes long, and creamy-spicy.",US
3257,US,"This is a unique wine with an unusual and impressive bouquet of peach smoke, cocoa and hazelnut. Balanced but firm on the palate, it offers robust fruit and spice flavors and mint, toast and nut accents. There's even an intriguing kirsch-like cherry note in here. Full-bodied, it's a wine of real individual character that finishes dense, long and spicy.",US
3258,US,"The fragrant and flavorful nose's butter, lychee and banana aromas create an alluring opening. Pink grapefruit and tropical fruit flavors accent a sweetly spicy, baked-apple mouth that has medium weight and a nice texture. The wine finishes dry and nutty, with moderate length. Smoky and lush, it's ready to drink tonight.",US
3259,US,"A flamboyant bouquet of pineapple, ripe orange, floral, nuts and toasty oak opens to a full palate of orange, nectarine and pineapple flavors. Interesting accents including brown sugar, buttered popcorn and mineral notes provide great tension against the fruit. Round and full—if a touch soft—it closes with a long, refined spicy-nutty finish.",US
3260,US,"Apple and tropical fruit aromas accented by mint, grass and herbal notes open to an equally bright palate of pineapple, mango and citrus flavors. In this classy, medium-bodied Chardonnay, these lively elements meet buttery vanilla notes in the mouth and flow into a long caramel finish with brisk, pepper-oak accents.",US
3261,US,"Big and oaky, as Private Reserves always are, the '99 is a textbook toasty Chardonnay. Apple, peach and plum aromas and flavors are wrapped in a smooth, smoky cocoon. The rich and supple palate feel is a winner, the long finish still tight. Enjoyable already, but should be held for a few years.",US
3262,US,"Intriguing Asian spice, peanut brittle, pineapple and butter cream aromas comprise the bouquet of this round, well-integrated wine from Sonoma County's tiny Green Valley appellation. Everything flows smoothly into the lingering pineapple, butterscotch, pear and apple flavors in the finish. Top Value.",US
3263,US,"This Chardonnay, from a small vineyard block in Jess Jackson's Alexander Mountain estate, is grand yet graceful. Oozing pear, butterscotch, melon and menthol flavors, it shows good weight and a positive richness that's supported by firm structure. It's balanced, appealing, admirably not overoaked and finishes long with flavors of melon, spice and pear offset by toasty accents. Top Value.",US
3264,US,"This seductive, creamy Chard wraps smoky, spicy, vanilla-laden oak flavors around a core of lush tropical fruit. There's lively acidity and a lot to like here. The finish shows a slight edge that may smooth out in another three or four months.",US
3265,US,"One of two Byron bottlings from this source; this one should be less difficult to find in stores. The dry apple and pear fruit flavors are bolstered by crisp acidity, refreshing mineral accents and earthy elements. This is a chewy, mouthfilling wine with richly textured palate feel. The long finish is tangy with citrus, cinnamon and mineral components.",US
3266,US,"Jed Steele's wines turned in impressive performances in this tasting—as in this full-bodied, well-integrated and elegant wine from the respected Sangiacomo Vineyard in Carneros. Tropical fruit, butterscotch, lemon and hops flavors caress the nose and palate, supported nicely by an acid spine. Creamy yet firm, the mouthfeel is admirable. The wine sports a stylish, mildly spicy finish. Top Value.",US
3267,US,"Fine flavor definition and very good acidity. Citrus, apple and herb aromas sing on the nose. Round apple, anise and pineapple show on the velvety palate. The wine finishes with a pretty melding of pineapple and vanilla, like an elegant tropical creamsicle. Enticing, but still tight enough to warrant holding it for a year or two.",US
3268,US,"Like autumn in a bottle, the subdued smoke and pear bouquet is followed by a buttered apple, toast and vanilla palate. The flavors are more understated than they sound—this wine is all about subtlety and balance. It builds in layers, complex and butter-smooth. The standout finish shows butterscotch and mineral notes in a delightful tension.",US
3269,US,"A pale gold color belies the full, deep aromas and flavors this wine offers. The lively, multifaceted nose highlights orange, pear, ginger snaps, anise and caramel notes. It opens to a rich, even palate that shows similar flavors and a smooth, buttery feel. The pleasing finish displays plenty of toast, vanilla and spice, and an impressive dry, leesy aftertaste.",US
3270,US,"Four different clones are separately fermented and then blended to make this unique bottling. An expansive nose shows vibrant pineapple, peach, and orange fruit with lemondrop and butterscotch accents. It's rich and mouthfilling, like a bite of banana cream pie, and turns maybe a bit orangey-sweet. Shy on subtlety, it packs in a lot of juicy flavor.",US
3271,US,"Apple, pear, coconut and chalk mark the bouquet of this smooth yet crisp and brisk wine from the Napa microproducer. Lime, pineapple and apricot with oak and cinnamon shadings are in play on the rich, viscous palate and flow beautifully through to the finish. Though full, the wine never gets weighty. It closes light on its feet, long and tangy, with lemon, cream and oak accents.",US
3272,US,"If you like piña coladas and getting caught in the—oh…I mean…coladas and ripe banana, caramel and pear aromas and flavors, then this wine delivers. There's an undeniable coconut quality here, and nice acid zip that keeps the fruit in the mix. The oak tannins need a bit of time to smooth out—they're a little edgy on the back end.",US
3273,US,"Heavy clove and cinnamon-spice notes grace the nose of this very limited single-vineyard offering. Honey, stone and a nuttiness mark the nose. Ripe and lively pineapple, banana, lime and grapefruit flavors shine nicely in a medium-weight, well-balanced style. Finishes long and tart. A year or two in the bottle will bring out more complexity.",US
3274,US,"A pear, apple-orange and earth bouquet sets the stage for a palate chockful of pineapple, pear and lemon flavor. Toast notes offset and vibrant acidity uplifts the fruit nicely. The finish is long and tart-sweet with complex leesy, earthy notes. Medium-bodied and restrained, this complex wine shows depth. Give it six months to a year to unfold.",US
3275,US,"The rich bouquet shows buttery, creamy vanilla notes with hints of tarragon and sweet hay. Golden apple and pear wears sweet butterscotch on the medium-weight, soft palate. Shows a bit of alcoholic heat as well as good intensity and impressive weight, but a one taster found it too controlled by vanillin oak qualities at the expense of the fruit.",US
3276,US,"Fermented with native yeast, this estate wine from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir pioneer Josh Jensen is classy, earthy and firm. Apple and yellow plum flavors mingle with mineral elements on the palate. It finishes nutty and tart, with good length and a solid acid spine. One of the few California wines that are Burgundian in spirit, this is still tight. Although it was one of the oldest wines we tasted, it can still use a few years to fully unfold.",US
3277,US,"Helen Turley's Chardonnay shows nice complexity, particularly on the nose, where nuanced oriental spice, tobacco, nectarine, floral and yellow fruit aromas play with the senses. The palate is mild and balanced, with melon, stone fruit and nut flavors, and a smooth texture to boot. Just a touch of heat shows on the long, dry yet spicy finish.",US
3278,US,"With its 90% Napa and 10% Sonoma lineage, this wine serves up mild lime, butterscotch and green apple aromas and a nicely weighted palate with tropical fruit, peach and caramel flavors.

3280,US,"Pear, pineapple and citrus aromas with spearmint accents comprise the bouquet of this Russian River favorite. The wine is round and soft with tea, lemon, tropical fruit and buttercream flavors. It's light- to medium- weight, but with enough complexity to hold the taster's interest, and a persistent, tangy, sweet and sour back-end fade.",US
3281,US,"Complex leesy, smoky, nutty aromas adorn the nose of this racy wine. It displays a citrusy tartness and lime, green apple, vanilla and wintergreen accents that linger refreshingly. Finishes with unusual apple, nut and burnt sugar aromas and flavors. A Mendocino appellation wine from Jim Clendenon, the notorious ‘Mind Behind' Santa Barbara County's Au Bon Climat Winery.",US
3282,US,"This opens with a muted but very pleasing nose of orange, pineapple, clove, almond and baked apple aromas. The palate's tropical fruit is complemented by butterscotch, clove and allspice flavors. Soft but well-constructed, it's a medium-weight wine with balanced fruit and well-utilized oak on the finish.",US
3283,US,"Bigger, rounder, toastier yet stylistically of a piece with the winery's regular Chardonnay, this appealing bottling is extra soft and extra rich. The flavors are nicely balanced and creamy,  finishing with a sweet pBordeaux blend comes on with well-ripened fruit, pretty cherry flavors accented with barrel notes of kahlùa, espresso and smoke. Concentrated and smooth throughout, it is the star of this new winery's first lineup of wines.",US
3284,US,"Here's a steely, minerally, sleek Chardonnay. Call it Cali-Chablis, if you will. That doesn't mean it's lean. Quite the opposite, it's an enormously complicated wine, with oak, lees and underlying peach custard and spicy mango cream flavors that finish long and dry. And what great acidity. Makes your mouth water. Chalk Hill is simply doing an amazing job lately, especially with Chardonnay.",US
3285,US,"Don't look for fat, buttery stuff here. This wine is as streamlined as a steel girder. With high acidity and a firm minerality, it hits the palate clean and spicy. But once it warms up, wham! Exotic kiwis, limes and mangoes take over as well as the buttercream effects of barrel fermentation. Fantastic concentration, and probably good for a decade.",US
3286,US,"Too sweet, with jammy pineapple and oak flavors. Crisp acidity and some minerality help to restore balance, but  the sugary taste is off-putting.",US
3287,US,"There's a good wine in here, but it's buried under so much oak, it's hard to taste it. The flavors of caramel and butterscotch swamp the underlying pineapples. Oakophiles will love it.",US
3288,US,"Shows the bright, tart acidity of this fine coastal region, with signature flavors of pineapples, figs, dates, limes and vanilla. But finishes too sweet in white sugar to earn a higher score.",US
3289,US,"Juicy and crisp, with green apple, lime and cinnamon granola flavors. Finishes clean and spicy.",US
3290,US,"Very oaky and very ripe, offering a flood of pineapple jam, pear, vanilla and toasty oak flavors. Crisp acidity provides needed balance and a clean, brisk mouthfeel.",US
3291,US,"This is hefty, dry and structured Chardonnay. Offers a complex musky, creamy nose that ushers in a range of tart citrus, coconut, toasted nut and mineral flavors. The smoky finish also shows a crisp, almost hard-edged metallic note. Stylized and appealing, but still tight—should be better in a year or two.",US
3292,US,"Aromas of ripe cantaloupe, vanilla and tropical fruits plus creamy malolactic notes show on the nose of this limited-production Napa Chardonnay. This offering, a distinct label from the proprietors of Far Niente, has apple, pear and white peach flavors. Expect caramel and nut accents on a smoothly textured, buttery palate. The finish is long and dry—you'll see a reprise of the nutty elements plus a hint of lime.",US
3293,US,"Announces itself with an unusual and pleasant Gewürtztraminer-like tangerine, lychee and ginger nose. Its mild but decidedly unique character is clearer on the melon, butter-cinnamon and peach palate. Nice acidity and a tangy-spicy finish.",US
3294,US,"In good vintages, Trefethen reserves a special portion of their Chardonnay production for late release in their Library Selection series. This latest offering—one of the oldest wines tasted—shows good balance and creamy, yet still crisp, smoothness. The green apple fruit is still holding well, along with a chalky note and a refreshing lime, herb and flinty tartness reminiscent of Chablis.",US
3295,US,"Refined and inviting, the bouquet offers caramel, hazelnuts and toast. Dark apple, toast, spice and earth flavors fill the mouth. The mouthfeel is rich and dense, though a touch more fruit would really have it singing. Finishes with spice and faint lime notes, and a toasty oak flavor that really takes over. The former Deutz Champagne estate in San Luis Obispo County, Laetitia is now devoted to producing Chardonnay and Pinot Noir.",US
3296,US,"This Carneros Chardonnay shows solid mainstream style. Apple, caramel and mint aromas on the nose open to apple, coconut and menthol-oak flavors. The mouthfeel is full, though some tasters thought more big than full. Toasty new oak takes the lead, and a touch of heat shows on the back end.",US
3297,US,"Notes of smoke, toast, lime and herbs play against guava, pear and brown sugar scents in the bouquet. A chalk note accents zesty orange, grapefruit and guava flavors and a soft mouthfeel. Vanilla, clove and oak highlights mark the wine's creamy, medium-length finish.",US
3298,US,"This is an impressive bottling with complex caramel, toasted nut and tropical fruit aromas. It's big bodied and coats the mouth with rich butterscotch, banana, apple and toasty oak flavors. A touch short on acid, it could use bit more backbone, but it's still big on toasty style. Its long, satisfying finish is an oak lover's paradise.",US
3299,US,"This big, brawny Chardonnay's potent nose of smoke, hay, orange, banana and pungent lees is an attention-grabber. Baked apple, buttered popcorn, and vanilla flavors come on strong along with an edge of spicy oak that carries through the finish. The panel rendered a split decision on this wine from veteran winemaker David Ramey. It showed harmony, length and finesse to some, but appeared edgy, a bit disjointed and obvious to others.",US
3300,US,"This blend of 35% Sonoma, 33% Santa Barbara and 32% Monterey grapes shows the intensity and depth of flavor that careful grape selection and knowledgeable blending can achieve. The wine is full and forward, with mango, pear, pineapple, popcorn and very toasty oak boldly coating the palate. Just a touch unsubtle, it's still very delicious, and finishes with butterscotch and nutmeg.",US
3301,US,"Tastes like harvest in Hawaii. Toasted marshmallow, coconut and sunny tropical fruit notes hula on the opulent nose. A medium-weight palate of rich and warm, very comfortable flavors—apple cider, spice and earth—follows. A tangy, spicy finish makes you wish it were a touch longer.",US
3302,US,"Rich opening aromas of pineapple, pear and lime plus toast and leesy accents open to a round palate of sweet pear, apple, vanilla and pineapple flavors. This nicely balanced, medium-weight wine is smooth, but the new wood really dominates the lengthy close.",US
3303,US,"Thyme and lavender notes mingle with orange, tangerine and banana aromas and flavors in this exotic, stylized wine. An ample dose of spicy new oak brings dimension, but also adds a dry, slightly austere note to the long finish. Appealing now; may integrate better with short-term cellaring.",US
3304,US,"The green apple and menthol toast bouquet shows some unusual tobacco-like aromas that are usually associated with red wines. A sip reveals mint, apple and caramel flavors on a full, oaky frame. Nicely balanced and still tight, it ends with slightly subdued but persistent caramel and toast flavors. Previous vintages of this Santa Barbara classic have performed well—often better—after cellaring. Try in two years.",US
3305,US,"A presently reined-in wine with exotic elements, showing a ginger, saffron and green apple bouquet. It's well-balanced, with lively apple and citrus flavors. It has good acidity and a firm structure that should hold it together for three or four years. With aging, it may integrate and develop further.",US
3306,US,"The bouquet is like an aromatic walk in the woods—it has pine, earth and floral elements as well as the expected fruit aromas. Red apple and plum flavors are accented by lemon-lime the mouth, and a mineral note asserts itself. It has body but not weight, and closes with a clean citrus-chalk finish.",US
3307,US,"Very ripe tropical fruits and appealing pear, apple and spice notes show well in this nicely balanced wine. Good acidity plays a solid supporting role here. The toasty oak holds the almost overripe fruit in check—it's strong from the mid palate through the handsome butter-and-apple finish.",US
3308,US,"This barrel-fermented Chardonnay shows smoky new oak and telltale matchstick leesy aromas. Real spiciness comes through on the palate. The apple fruit wears strong clove, nutmeg and butterscotch notes. There's a firm acid backbone that's lively, but slightly jarring to some tasters. Give this one four to six months to knit itself together.",US
3309,US,"The complex smoke, earth, spice and mineral aromas that open this wine are followed by subdued tangerine and citrus flavors, dried spice and mineral accents on an oaky frame. Like the other Mt. Carmel Vineyard offerings, this is a bit tight now but has a promising, good balance. Not a fruit-driven wine, this finishes long with spice and mineral elements. Only 86 cases produced.",US
3310,US,"Opens with a lovely bouquet of lemon and tart pineapple fruit with anise, mineral and tobacco accents. The lemony note resurfaces on the pear, white peach and green apple palate. A chalk element adds interest and balances the overall zingy, bright tone in this tangy, high-alcohol wine.",US
3311,US,"Mint, fresh fruit and decidedly floral aromas led to yet another split-decision wine you may just have to taste yourself. Some tasters found elegance, white stone fruits, citrus and good acidity leading to a rich, silky finish with buttery and nutty notes. Others (same bottle!) found it soft, sweet and a bit cloying in a “your auntie's perfume” manner. Strange, but true…we can't make this stuff up.",US
3312,US,"This estate vineyard wine's complex nose melds mineral, spice and lime aromas with herb and floral notes. It handles the disparate elements gracefully, showing body but not weight, and has a soft, almost tender mouthfeel. There's a touch of floral sweetness in the mouth—as on the nose—offset by earthy, mineral flavors on a lithe frame. This wine shows real subtlety, but leaves us wishing for more depth. Finishes light, dry and flinty.",US
3313,US,"A lively citrus tang balances the rounder fig, melon, toast and dried spice flavors that predominate here. Finishes evenly with medium length. It seems to be at its peak, so drink this round and well-integrated Chardonnay up now.",US
3314,US,"Smooth and creamy from start to finish, this wine is a dead-on mainstream pleaser. Begins with a nutty and toasty nose that also shows traces of apple and lemon. The palate, buttressed by a healthy dose of oak, also offers a lot of fruit flavor, including pear and lemon, without being overly sweet. The bouquet's creamy and nutty notes reappear on the supple back end.",US
3315,US,"A touch of mint graces the tropical fruit-laden nose of this respected Monterey bottling. Fruit driven yet taut, the orange, pineapple, apple and herbal notes here show an earth-and-mineral complexity without the common overt oakiness. If you are fan of less-overtly oaked wines, this is a medium-weight, stylish offering with personality and fine balance.",US
3316,US,"For decades Hanzell has been making one of California's most (and only) ageworthy Chards. The '03 is one for the cellar, but it comes at the price of being hard in youth. Starts out flinty and tannic, although as it airs, new oak and pineapple emerge. This seems like a very good Hanzell. Best 2009–2015.",US
3317,US,"Simple and direct, with oaky flavors of pineapples, apricots and tropical fruits. Finishes slightly sweet.",US
3318,US,"A fresh, clean wine with lively acidity. This Chardonnay has lifted tangerine and pineapple flavors, plus a rich coat of oak that adds vanilla and buttered toast flavors. Drink now.",US
3319,US,"Big, bright and round, with a buttery, oaky mix of tropical fruits and plenty of sweet, toasty oak. Very well made in a rich, round, approachable style.",US
3320,US,"Whoa! 400,000 cases of this wine are being released, an enormous production for a Washington wine. Better yet, it's good. Smooth, plump and quite fruity, just soft enough (from partial malolactic fermentation), not too buttery, but just a hint of butterscotch. In short, it tastes like real wine, not microwave popcorn, and has some lasting power.",US
3321,US,"Taste more like a white Rhône wine than Chard, so loses a point or two for lack of typicity, but it's a flavorful sipper. With rich flavors of honeysuckle and tropical fruit, the mouthfeel is soft and barrel-creamy.",US
3322,US,"Clean and flinty-minerally, this is a light-bodied, delicate Chard whose appeal is in its elegance. Oak accents modest pineapple, pear and peach fruit.",US
3323,US,"Very rich, ripe and oaky, but something of a fruit-oak bomb. Blasts the palate with pineapple jam, toasty meringue, caramel and buttered toast aromas and flavors. Lacks subtlety.",US
3324,US,"Attractive pear, citrus, melon and mild spice aromas open this lean and elegant wine. The mouthfeel is light, but not insubstantial and slightly tense (in a good way), showing good acid spine, crisp citrus flavors and taut mineral accents. A slight creaminess keeps it from getting too sharp, and it closes with a nice chalky note. Has the stuff to keep and may well merit a higher score with a few years of aging.",US
3325,US,"Susie Selby's homage to her late father has some sulfur and earthy notes on the nose, but there's good fruit behind. This full-bodied, nicely textured Chardonnay has nutty, smoky and spicy flavors melding with tangy tropical fruit to create a tasty, fairly lush wine that's easy to enjoy. Finishes soft, with a faint whiff of petrol—in the Alsace manner—and is drinking well now.",US
3326,US,"Aromas of movie popcorn, hops and Asian pear open this rather over-the-top wine. It's a decidedly candy-sweet combination of butterscotch, peach and nut flavors with a soft, round mouthfeel. The light orange finish is easy. If you have good friends who just don't like dry wines, this is a great one to serve them.",US
3327,US,"Citrus, pineapple, white stone fruits and green apple are among the aromas and flavors in this clean, medium-weight offering. The wine has a nice butterscotch streak, but some tasters found it light to the point of insubstantial, while others praised its balance and elegance.",US
3328,US,"Smoky, heavy toasted oak complements mild tropical fruit, nuts and coconut on the nose. The toasty flavor and a decidedly earthy note reads big against the pineapple, citrus and rich vanilla notes showing in the palate of this even, medium-weight wine. Finishes dry, brisk and slightly tart.",US
3329,US,"The bouquet offers dazzling aromas, including pineapple, banana, cinnamon, nutmeg, roasted nuts and butter. On the palate, the wine becomes more focused: taut pear, citrus and golden apple flavors closely wrapped in a tasty butterscotch and toast cocoon. Finishes long and even; could still use six months to a year to unwind.",US
3330,US,"The historic estate's 1998 is characteristically lean, angular and fairly closed. The bouquet of apple cider, anise, and fragrant jasmine-like notes opens to a trim palate of green apple and toast flavors, and a taut mouthfeel. Tart apple and oak, plus a flinty, mineral element play on the finish. Notoriously tight when young, this wine often opens incredibly with cellaring.",US
3331,US,"Tasters pegged apples, anise, crème brûlée and cinnamon in the lively nose of this rich wine—one that also sparked some controversy. The straight-ahead flavor profile is appealing, with solid apple, clove and butterscotch offset by the attractive anise streak. But is it native yeast or heavy malolactic fermentation that's responsible for the mixed feelings some panelists expressed? Concerns were noted about a dairy-like note on the nose and also a slick, yet gummy texture. Nevertheless, the winning aromas and flavors kept the overall take positive.",US
3332,US,"Another one of Jed Steele's many single-vineyard offerings this wine from Santa Barbara is big and perfumey. Pineapple, banana and caramel flavors are cloaked in sweetness that may be a bit heavy for some.",US
3333,US,"Restraint and elegance are not what you usually find in a Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay, but this one offers tart apple, citrus, and peach flavors along with a dose of toasty new oak. Clean and understated style.",US
3334,US,"We enjoyed the vanilla, pear, butter and toasty flavors on this classy Chard, but the high alcohol it contains almost does it in. The nice acid backbone holds it together though and leaves a good overall impression. Enjoy it with grilled seafood.",US
3335,US,"Lavishly oaked from the first whiff on the nose and palate, dense toasty notes envelope the pineapple and tropical fruit. Plenty of vanilla and both a tangy nuttiness and a creaminess from the oak, provide a nice mouthfeel tension. Panelists had two schools of thought about this wine: The oak totally dominates—certainly now—and how you feel about that determines your take on the wine. Lacking fruit? Or just tight and needing a year or two to open? Only time will tell.",US
3336,US,"This sunny, medium-gold wine opens with caramel and apple aromas. More candy apple-like flavors appear in the mouth, accompanied by tropical fruit and toasty accents with a rich caramel tone. It verges on too-sweet, but it's nonetheless pleasing in an uncomplicated way.",US
3337,US,"This light and elegant wine opens with orange and mild tropical fruit aromas. Easy peach and pear flavors bear dry vanilla and toasty oak accents. Even and soft on the palate, the nutty-leesy-chalky finish brings the wine to a pleasing close.",US
3338,US,"Pear, pineapple and herb aromas intrigued some tasters, but others found an odd note in this wine's nose. Vanilla, pear, apple and sweet spices mark the medium-weight and round palate. The back end of this wine has tangy wood and a slight chalkiness.",US
3339,US,"This Chard displays a slightly unusual but appealing sweet and sour streak. The bouquet shows tart green apples, grapefruit, stewed fruit and sweet herbs, plus tangy green oak shadings. The palate delivers more of the same, with zingy citrus and crisp apple flavors, but also dry, leesy notes. There's both cream and pepper on the back end of this likeable, split-personality wine.",US
3340,US,"The bouquet of Farrell's wine is a mixed bag of buttered popcorn, minerals, herbs, citrus fruit, pineapple and melon stuffed in an oak envelope. Similarly attractive flavors mark the palate, which is fairly full and has an almost rustic quality. Has all the body and length you could want, if not quite all the balance and finesse.",US
3341,US,"Some very appealing apple, asian pear, mint, smoke and toast notes mark the nose of this even, medium-weight wine. It has fine fruit-to-acid balance and offers apple-peach flavors with a mild but evident butterscotch element. The tangy oak that's present from the start shows most prominently on the spicy finish.",US
3342,US,"A full and creamy bouquet announces a palate laden with ripe golden delicious apple, vanilla, and melon flavors, with chalk, mineral and earth elements. The dry finish carries some length and builds in intensity. A straightforward wine that's ready to drink right now.",US
3343,US,"This Napa Valley mainstay's offering shows a firm acid backbone and crisp, bright green apple flavors with lemony accents. Overall a bit on the lean side, but it shows just a hint of butteriness and some tangy new oak spice on the long, tart finish.",US
3344,US,"The full fresh-bread aromas of yeast, honey, oats promise much body, but the palate delivers a dry citrus-mineral mouthful of flavors. Mouthfeel is dry and briskly acid—but with a nice chalky note, too. Chalk shows again on the finish, where it somewhat checks the sharp lemony-metallic notes.",US
3345,US,"Big and easy with caramel and creamy notes to spare, this has good apple, spice and toast elements and an appealing nutty-leesy aspect. Still, it seems already quite mature, like it needs to be drunk now. Enjoy it soon for its full mouthfeel and ripe baked apple flavors.",US
3346,US,"From the smoky, spicy nose through the spicy apple notes in the mouth, this bottling has an intriguing earth and mineral streak from start to finish. Medium-bodied, the wine offers some lemon and mineral tang and a lot of smoky oak on the finish.",US
3347,US,"This very rare, single-vineyard Chardonnay has distinct vanilla, golden delicious apple, banana and peach flavors—a nice mix of sweet and sour, but some tasters found searing acidity and a sharp metallic note. Finishes tart, dry and long with a bracing edge capable of cutting right through your fried calamari and spicy sauce. Only 132 cases produced.",US
3348,US,"A big nose of toasty oak, vanilla and butterscotch opens this offering. There are hints of pear and apple fruit, but the palate has a dominating oakiness and a custardy fatness. It's slightly hot, with dominant butterscotch and vanillin oaky flavors.",US
3349,US,"Respected vineyard source and established record of the winemaker notwithstanding, the dense gunpowder/matchstick quality here isn't easy to take—or even read. It is stylized, and big (we can sense suppressed tropical fruit and earthy, mineral notes below the veneer). Hidden treasure…or just rough stuff?",US
3350,US,"There's real consistency to Hendry's array of block-designated Chardonnays. This one shares those qualities of earthy, herbal, even tobaccoey notes along with apple and peach flavors. It shares also the dryness and softness. These are very distinct wines, and they have their place in the menu of California Chardonnay.",US
3351,US,"Named after the scenic highway that runs along the coastal mountains, this unoaked Chard is bone dry, crisp in acids, and lean. The flavors are of grapefruits and limes. A very elegant wine that appeals for its clean balance and zest.",US
3352,US,"The pleasant nose of nuts, green apples and caramel also shows an odd whiff that mattered more to some tasters than others. Light apple fruit, spice, earth and butterscotch notes play on the full, but vaguely sour milk-tinged palate. Finishes tart and dry with slight mineral notes, in the manner of some white Burgundies. We've been big fans of Foxen's wines in the past, but this one left us scratching our heads.",US
3353,US,"This wine cuts a racy Chablis-like profile. Green apple and lemon-lime fruit, mild spices and a dry earthiness are all in play here. They ride on brisk acidity through a tart and minerally finish. A thoroughbred wine that, to some, “lacks stuffing.”",US
3354,US,"Some panelists praised this Chardonnay's balance and zingy citrus flavors; others were put off by its potent, even overwhelming, oak and green woody aspects. It's full-bodied, and there are pleasant pear, lime and butterscotch notes fighting for space on the palate. Give it a year or two and judge for yourself.",US
3355,US,"The nose here shows clean pine and citrus notes, with accents of herb and tropical fruit. Straightforward apple, pear and nut flavors show on the palate. In some ways, including the nutty finish, the wine is good—in other ways, it's just there.",US
3356,US,"Slightly odd-scented nose with hints of pipe tobacco, grapefruit, green apple and herbs. Better on the palate with green pear, faint apple, pineapple and herbal notes in a tart, lean framework. Pleasant hints of oak show up on the finish.",US
3357,US,"The nutty, smoky notes on the nose are overshadowed by taut, high-octane alcohol-mineral scents. The stony, mineral-laden palate also shows earthy, apple-oatmeal flavors. The mouthfeel is full, yet tight (we could say ripe, but it's not fruit-driven wine). This unusual offering fades long but closed, with hints of spice and coffee. Previous tastings of Mt. Carmel have proved it a tough read when young. Hold and taste in three years.",US
3358,US,"The nose here delivers a hefty dose of meaty, smoky, nutty notes paired with mild pear and apple. The palate doesn't show complexity—a pronounced toasted oak rides hard on apple and pineapple fruit. It's balanced and finishes dry, but comes up wanting the desired texture and nuance.",US
3359,US,"Lean and tautly balanced, this wine has an outdoorsy, mineral-and-hay bouquet and sweet herbal accents. Green apple flavors take over the palate, though hints of lemon and minerals also show up. Tasters didn't find anything terribly wrong here, just a lack of element that would make it more right. Finishes with lingering oaky notes.",US
3360,US,"Crème brûlée and baked apple aromas on the nose open to a smooth palate of mild apple, pineapple and spice flavors with citrus accents.The flavors aren't vibrant, though, and the intensity of the oak rendered the faint fruit nearly invisible.",US
3361,US,"There's still a good and pleasant dose of pineapple and apple fruit accented by vanilla spice in this wine, but a mature and overly soft palate-feel suggests that it's best consumed near-term. Finishes smooth and light, with medium length. Drink up this year.",US
3362,US,"Opens with a nice nose of roasted nuts, banana, caramel and a hint of smoke. The palate's pear, baked apple and apricot flavors wear interesting coconut accents, but all these are unfortunately overrun by a scotch notes peek out from behind an edgy acidity.",US
3363,US,"The deep gold color here suggests age, as do the soft, vaguely oxidized flavors. Still, it shows some nice vanilla and baked apple notes, as well as slight chalk accents, on its toasty oak frame. Drink now.",US
3364,US,"Asian pear, but also dairy-like notes of cheese, sour cream and show on the nose. The mouthfeel is a bit heavy. Apple and woody flavors show on the palate; dry wood and spice mark the back end. A good wine, but now reading ponderously—perhaps past its prime.",US
3365,US,"Offers an attractive nose of white peach, pear, lime and anise, but fails to come through with much substance on the palate. Simple and buttery-slick in the mouth, it shows some spicy notes but not much else, and turns a bit hot on the finish.",US
3366,US,"A good Chardonnay, if a little unbalanced, showing some green, minty notes to the citrus and oak. Despite the rich creaminess, feels somewhat unripe. Drink now.",US
3367,US,"Very ripe and forward in pineapples and honey, with brisk acidity. Good and rich, but seems overwrought, lacking complexity and nuance, like a fruit juice drink.",US
3368,US,"Crisp and fine in coastal acidity, with bright flavors of pineapples, ripe pears and green apples, this would be a good Chardonnay, except for one thing. It's too sweet.",US
3369,US,"Pale and watery, with bare hints of lemon, pineapple and unripe melon. There's not much here except lemony water.",US
3370,US,"A little dark, heavy and sweet, not to mention prematurely old. The pineapple fruit is aging already, and there's a vegetal edge.",US
3371,US,"Soft and oaky, this is a simple Chardonnay with more than its share of buttery oak. Flavors are cracker, toast, buttered nuts; there is little impact from the fruit.",US
3372,US,"This is a lovely Chardonnay, delicately structured, elegantly silky, crisp and authoritative. It doesn't whack you with fruit, but presents subtle peach custard, buttercream and citrus flavors girded with a hard minerality. Quite a bit of new oak adds complexity. This is a good Chard for foodies who shy away from the fruit bombs.",US
3373,US,"Super-ripe in tropical papaya, pineapple and white peach flavors, with a charry, caramel sweetness that seems to come from oak. Sweet clove and anise on the finish.",US
3374,US,"From certified organic grapes comes this clean, fruity Chard. There's little, if any oak; the fruit stars here, a burst of green apples, pears and spices, brightened with good acids.",US
3375,US,"There is nothing especially wrong here, but it is such a predictable, monolithic, corporate wine that it's hard to get very excited. Clean fruit and soft, buttery flavors, along with vanilla and banana, seem calculated rather than crafted. Safe and solid.",US
3376,US,"Comprised of 100% estate-grown grapes and barrel fermented in new French oak, this is Woodward Canyon's premier Chardonnay. The richness of the oak almost overpowers the nose, but when one thinks of premier cru Burgundy it's hard to tell the difference. In the mouth, the fruit more than holds its own, with firm acids and plenty of ripe peach and apricot flavors. Additional time in bottle is needed to soften the hard edges. Just 143 cases made.",US
3377,US,"Lots of oak on this wine, which shows rich vanilla custard, buttered toast and caramel flavors. However, the underlying fruit isn't able to support it. There's some pineapple and nectarine, but the wine ultimately collapses under all the wood.",US
3378,US,"This is a clean, oaky and fairly simple Chardonnay. It satisfies the basic varietal requirements, with pineapple tart, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors. From Testarossa.",US
3379,US,"So much richer than the '03, and a really nice example of Edna Valley terroir. The wine is brilliant in acidity, giving it an uplifted, bright mouthfeel. The flavors of kiwi, tangerine and smoky oak are delicious.",US
3380,US,"Super-rich, a fat, opulent Chard that tastes almost as sweet as a dessert, except it's dry. Shows massive flavors of Meyer lemon custard, minerals, pear tart, buttered toast, butterscotch, smoky pie crust and honey, with a sprinkle of cinnamon and nutmeg. Lush and gorgeous.",US
3381,US,"A spectacular Chardonnay grown in Failla's estate vineyard, high in the mountains above the Sonoma Coast, and open to the Pacific's cool winds. The pineapple custard, tangerine, lemon tart and mineral flavors are compellingly delicious, while crisp coastal acidity adds a refreshingly clean tang. This is a grand cru wine.",US
3382,US,"A big, bold, exuberantly rich wine, classic Williams Selyem Chard. The underlying wine is all pineapples, peaches, pears and exotic tropical fruits, while oak adds elaborate layers of buttered toast, caramel, nougat and vanilla. Acidity is high, which will help the wine age through 2013.",US
3383,US,"Morgan has hit its stride with this unoaked Chardonnay. Nothing comes between the intense citrus, pineapple, white peach, apple and spice flavors and your palate. Cleansing acidity boosts it all and makes the wine star-bright. Morgan leads the pack of California unoaked Chards.",US
3384,US,"Very crisp in zesty acidity, bone dry, and with exotic flavors. This stony, minerally Chardonnay impresses for its firm structure. Flavorwise, it's explosive in lemons, limes, crunchy pears, Asian spices and buttery vanilla, even though it's unoaked. Showcases its terroir in a fine way.",US
3385,US,"Intense aromas of apples and pears start things off, and in the mouth the wine strikes just the right balance between intensity, crispness and full-flavored opulence. Good fruit, good acids, a pleasing creaminess, and an extended finish that lingers cleanly through flavors of toast and butter. Best Buy.",US
3386,US,"This top-of-the-line Chardonnay from Columbia Crest gets extra time in barrel and bottle, and comes from the much-heralded 1998 vintage. It's a rich, creamy style, with less obvious buttery oak than the Grand Estates, but more complexity and a thicker, more complex feel to it. Flavors mix fruit, wood, spice and herb evenly. It has a comforting feeling of weight to it; it's not just up-front, aggressive flavors. Editors' Choice.",US
3387,US,"Simple and fruity, this is a pleasant, easy-drinking table wine. The Barrel Select designation does not mean oaky.",US
3388,US,"Shows the ripe pineapple fruit, acidity, minerality and above all sweet, smoky oak that mark a rich California Chardonnay. But there's something off. Hard to say exactly what, but it's in the taste. Like a smattering of mold or shriveled grapes that's off-putting.",US
3389,US,"Another success from this vineyard, which supplies Chardonnay to some of the best producers in the state. Perfect structure, matching acid and mineral to citrus fruit, juice and rind. Fragrant, textural and deep.",US
3390,US,"This isn't one of those rich, gooey Chardonnays that dazzle some people. But it's a crisp, minerally wine that shows great elegance and Chablis-like sophistication. Dry and crisp, it shows complex flavors of tart green apples and pears, with subtle influences of smoky oak.",US
3391,US,"Ultrarich and oaky, with vanilla, buttered toast, caramel and smoky flavors accenting the underlying pineapple, guava, nectarine and pear fruits. This opulent wine will meld and become mellow in another 2–3 years.",US
3392,US,"For the first time the fruit was sourced from Conner Lee vineyard old vines. It's a glorious wine, a near-perfect mix of citrus and stone, kissed with honey and dust, lightly buttery. Fermented mostly with native yeast, this is one of the best Washington Chardonnays of a very good vintage.",US
3393,US,"Complex, with tiers of tropical fruit, mineral, and oak flavors that unfold in waves. The wine is dry and opulent in spiced papayas and macaroons, leading to a caramel-like finish.",US
3394,US,"A pretty good, everyday Chardonnay that gives consumers the buttered toast and vanilla notes that come from oak, on top of a friendly, pineapple-flavored Chardonnay. A little one-dimensional, but will satisfy lots of wine drinkers.",US
3395,US,"This is a fine companion wine to Hogue's less-expensive “regular” Chardonnay. It shows the same luscious, tropical/citrus fruit flavors, the added layers of caramel and vanilla, the spicy finish. Just a bit more punch and power to it, and along with all that, a certain youthful tightness that suggests another half-year of cellar time is in order.",US
3396,US,"Mature and full bodied, with caramel and crème-brûlée aromas. The even, rich mouthfeel has a creamy texture. Tropical fruit, spice and caramel flavors on the palate extend into the finish, where a dry, chalky note and the underlying acidity come up. Lovely now.",US
3397,US,"The vineyard is in the northeastern Salinas Valley, in the Gavilan foothills, which makes it a cool climate. The wine has adequate acidity and oak, with flavors of peaches and cream and a rich, honeyed finish. Could have more depth and complexity, though, especially at this price.",US
3398,US,"As with the reserve, the house style is to make a soft, lightly buttery, very approachable wine. Nice light tropical fruit flavors are a blend of mango, pineapple and banana. There is nothing heavy-handed about the oak, it's nicely layered into the background.",US
3399,US,"Shows a welcome return to form after the '06. This time, the butterscotchy oak plays a supporting role, allowing the pineapple, pear, guava and mineral flavors to shine. Beautiful and elegant.",US
3400,US,"The vineyard is the source of fantastic Pinot Noirs and Chardonnays for several wineries, and Barnett scores big points with this lush, rich but balanced wine. It's tremendous in pineapple, pear, green apple and oaky vanilla flavors, but beautifully balanced with firm acidity. Represents an impressive step forward for this bottling.",US
3401,US,"A beautiful Chardonnay with so much class and elegance, it's a bargain at this price. Shows lush flavors of pineapple crème brûlée, Meyer lemon custard and vanilla sorbet, balanced with crisp acidity and a fine touch of smoky oak. Perfect with shellfish.",US
3402,US,"A lovely Chardonnay, dry, elegant and minerally. Displays real control, with the pineapple, lemondrop candy, apricot and oak flavors balanced by crisp acidity. Easily as good as Chards costing far more, which makes it a value.",US
3403,US,"Oaky and direct, this is the kind of Chard that will appeal to lots of people for its spicy, pineapple and papaya fruit flavors and creamy texture.",US
3404,US,"So oaky, it tastes like a toothpick; this is all caramel, butterscotch and toast.",US
3405,US,"The grapes come from Atlas Peak, and while the wine is dry, it's very soft, which gives the ultraripe apricots and peaches a syrupy taste. The caramelly oak adds to the feeling of heaviness.",US
3406,US,"A simple, everyday Chardonnay, with ripe pineapple, apricot and tropical fruit and caramelized oak flavors.",US
3407,US,"The Grand Estates is CC's midpriced offering, and the Chardonnay sees plenty of oak and sur-lie aging. Rich, toasted-nut aromas underscore firm apple and pear fruit. The custardy texture is a treat. Best Buy.",US
3408,US,"Hogue makes a full line of Chardonnays and calls this least expensive bottling their “fruit forward” version. Although that's true, there's more to this wine than simple fruit. There's fruit aplenty, to be sure, but other layers of flavor interest as well: vanilla cream, caramel and cinnamon spice. Best Buy.",US
3409,US,"This excellent Chardonnay is both crisp and smooth, with ripe, lemony green apples augmented with hints of custard and vanilla. It has both weight and balance, and should cellar well for the near term. But why not enjoy it now?",US
3410,US,"Here again is fine, rich, ripe fruit, mostly pears and peaches and bananas, layered and textured. The flavors build through a full, delicious middle, with some nice creaminess from barrel fermentation. What's missing is the pleasing toast of new oak, which would etch the fruit into a bit more focus. A hint of residual sweetness rounds out the finish. Best Buy.",US
3411,US,"Rich and oaky, with lavish flavors of vanilla custard, smoky meringue and créme brulée. The fruit consists of ripe pineapples and Meyer lemons.",US
3412,US,"This is all Sundance vineyard, beautifully executed. It's got a ton of character, intensity, and brilliant, bright fruit. The acids are natural and flavors run through the citrus spectrum, from lime to pineapple, with great persistence.",US
3413,US,"Big and bold, a ripe, oaky Chardonnay that needs some time in the cellar to come together. Offers tiers of apricot, pear, peach and nectarine flavors, with a stony minerality and crisp acidity that makes the mouth water. Bone dry and complex, this Chablisian Chardonnay will blossom some time in 2010.",US
3414,US,"A lush expression of buttered brioche, Key lime, toasted nuts and light tropical fruit, nicely woven together. It gains fullness as it breathes and opens up right in the mouth. The finish extends and details beautifully, without relying on superripe fruit or excessive oak.",US
3415,US,"Doesn't have the richness or polish of the Reserve, and in fact is pretty ordinary. Shows a creamy mouthfeel and fruity, oaky flavors, with a candied apricot finish.",US
3416,US,"Thin to the point of watery. It has extremely modest fruit, but a lot of toasted, sweet oak.",US
3417,US,"Wineglass Cellars is a boutique producer whose focus has been on red wines; this, notes winemaker David Lowe, is their first Chardonnay that's “serious.” It takes the crisp structure of Washington fruit and adds a healthy dose of new oak, giving it plenty of toast, spice and vanilla. It's a winning combination, and sure to please. Just 277 cases made. Best Buy.",US
3418,US,"The apple, earth and mild tropical fruit aromas, good mouthfeel and apple-pear and caramel flavors are all right on target. Lockwood's largest volume bottling, this hits all the right notes. Toasty, spicy oak mingles with apple, spice and butterscotch on the close. Drink now.",US
3419,US,"Smooth apple-pear and buttery, toasty aromas open to like flavors. That fruit core is offset by mild mango accents and lots of spicy oak, which continue through the long finish. For fans of rich, oaky full-bodied Chardonnay.",US
3420,US,"This is a well-made, balanced effort with green apple fruit enhanced with hints of honey and allspice. Still quite young and tight, it is just beginning to soften up and show some nice toasted, roasted nuts in the finish. It isn't quite as intense as the Barrel Fermented Chardonnay from CSM; this is a slightly softer, more approachable wine.",US
3421,US,"A clean, high acid style, showing pineapple/citrus fruit flavors and light touches of fresh green herb.",US
3422,US,"Made in a softly flamboyant style, with massive flavors of citrus and tropical fruits, buttered toast, cinnamon and crème brûlée, firmed with stony minerals. Tons of stuffing in this opulent Chardonnay, which was aged in 50% new oak.",US
3423,US,"There's a lot of oak on this Chard, sourced from multiple vineyards, and the barrel influences currently dominate, with the vanilla, butterscotch and caramel flavors many people confuse with the taste of Chardonnay itself. In this case, the underlying pineapple, pear and green apple fruit is ample enough to support all that weight.",US
3424,US,"Ripe, lush and immediately attractive, this Chard offers rich tiers of pineapple custard, pear marmalade, vanilla, buttered toast, toasted coconut and Asian spice flavors. It's a strong, flamboyant wine that calls for equally strong foods, like lobster.",US
3425,US,"Only 20% new oak on this wine, but it sure does stand out, dominating the modest fruit with a smoky, charry taste. Hard to like this toothpicky Chard.",US
3426,US,"The name honors one of the founders of the original winery, and the wine generally mixes buttery fruit with a blast of oak flavor. It's burly, bold and aggressive; subtlety is not its strong suit. But in this price range, for the oak-lover in the crowd, it's a great choice, ready to drink right now.",US
3427,US,"Columbia Crest makes three Chardonnays, of which this is the least expensive. It boasts assertive, somewhat herbaceous aromas of peach and spice; the fruit is clean, forward and zesty. It displays a lot of character in a vivid style that showcases Washington's  intense fruit and lip-smacking acids.",US
3428,US,"Something went south on this wine. It has a stubbornly vegetal or moldy note throughout, to the detriment of the fruit, which seems to be rich, and the oak, which certainly is. Tasted in a flight of its price peers, it was a big last place.",US
3429,US,"Tight, taut and lemony, a Chablis-like Chardonnay of extreme dryness and minerality. Shows mouthwatering flavors of flint, Meyer lemons and limes, with a touch of smoky oak. Very fine and elegant, a beautiful Chardonnay that will support, not overwhelm, food.",US
3430,US,"The mountain vineyard somehow manages not only to beautifully ripen the grapes to a great expression of fruit, but also preserves vital acidity and lends a firm layer of minerality. The result is a big, powerful wine that easily absorbs its lavish coat of new oak. The flavors are of candied pineapple tart, Meyer lemon mousse and vanilla custard, with a finish of sweet, crushed Asian spices. Perfect now, and just beginning to gather momentum. Drink through 2011, at least, with proper cellaring.",US
3431,US,"Absolutely delicious, first-rate Chard from this veteran producer. Shows the prettiest balance of all its parts, and just about as good as California Chard gets. Ripely opulent in tropical fruit, apricot and tangerine flavors and crisp in limey acids, the wine's 50% new oak adds luscious notes of buttercream, toast, smoke and vanilla.",US
3432,US,"Dobles lías means double lees. Extended lees contact has given this Chard great creaminess in the mouth, a smooth impression that is heightened by malolatic fermentation. Beyond that, the wine is fully dry, balanced in alcohol, and lush in flavor. Pineapple custard and charred meringue take center stage, but there's a complex cast of Key lime pie, peach preserves, butterscotch, cinnamon and vanilla. Compelling and authoritative.",US
3433,US,"This is a good, oaky Chardonnay for those who like their Chards bright in acidity and fruit. The flavors veer toward ripe pears, buttered toast and sweet herbs, but have an earthy undercurrent.",US
3434,US,"A solid Chardonnay, although it finishes a bit sweet. Shows ripe flavors of pineapples, pears and oranges, with a flourish of smoky oak.",US
3435,US,"So fruity it's almost sweet. Made in the popular style, it's candied in vanilla, pineapple, buttered toast and caramel flavors.",US
3436,US,"Creamy and crisp, this Chard is ultrarich in fruit, with lemondrop, pineapple tart filling, crème brûlée and buttered toast flavors. Really delicious and complicated, it's from a vineyard on mountainous slopes in the heart of the Silicon Valley suburb of Los Gatos.",US
3437,US,"Here's a young, powerful wine that captures the essence of cool-climate Chardonnay. The vineyard is where Russian River Valley meets Sonoma Coast, south and west of Rochioli, and the wine is similar, in both tart green apples and acidity, with richer notes of tangerine, peach and papaya. Buttered toast, butterscotch and smoky vanilla are oak's contributions, in this brilliant, suave Chard.",US
3438,US,"Tastes vegetal and tired. The wine is losing its pineapple and pear fruit, and there's not much to replace it except alcohol and oak.",US
3439,US,"A pleasant, nondescript wine. There's 10% Sauvignon Blanc in the blend, which gives it a little spicy lift, but the mainstay Chardonnay core seems generically lemony and falls away in the finish.",US
3440,US,"A terrific Chardonnay. You won't miss the oak at all. Offers a wealth of pineapple pie, Meyer lemon sorbet, green apple jam and vanilla flavors, brightened by clean, crisp coastal acidity. Sommeliers, buy this one in quantity. Easy to find, with 45,000 cases produced.",US
3441,US,"This is a big, oaky, creamy Chardonnay, but it retains the crisp acidity and overall control to be balanced and even elegant despite its size. Shows potent flavors of pineapple-infused crème brûlée, butterscotch and vanilla custard. Drink now.",US
3442,US,"Bright and zesty, with flavors of limes, kiwi fruit, green apples and pineapples, accompanied by crisp acidity. Could almost be an Edna Valley Chardonnay. Oak plays only a supporting role.",US
3443,US,"Really classic Russian River Chard, so elegantly structured and sleek, yet so flavorful. A wonderful structure of bright acidity and fine, toasty oak frames succulent flavors of pineapples, tangerines, green apples pears and minerals, leading to a long, richly spicy finish.",US
3444,US,"The underlying fruit smacks of lemon curd, peach pie and kumquats, with a keen, cold minerality. Well-charred oak and lees contribute the richest notes of butterscotch, vanilla and toast. Dry, crisp and elegant, this is one of the best Dry Creek Valley Chards I've ever tasted, but it's still not in the league of the best cool-climate bottlings.",US
3445,US,"There's a minerality to this Chard that makes it bracing, although it also shows the opulence of Fogarty's other '04s. A tang of gunmetal undergirds the tropical fruit and vanilla custard flavors that are wrapped into a creamy texture. Almost begs for shrimp, lobster, crab, the more richly prepared, the better.",US
3446,US,"Vine Ciff has become one of the most successful producers of Chardonnay in Napa Valley. The reason why, besides sourcing great grapes, is balance. Everything works in this wine, which is a mélange of rich tropical fruit, crisp acidity, a creamy texture, and sweet wood tannins.",US
3447,US,"Here's a wonderfully balanced Chardonnay. It's rich, ripe and oaky, with crisp cool-climate acidity boosting the pineapple and papaya fruit, but there's also a mineral, diesel note throughout that adds complexing interest and firmness. Should hold for five years.",US
3448,US,"From a venerable Burgundian producer comes this earthy, spicy wine, with a body and texture that are unctuous and creamy. There's a whole fruit basket here, with everything from green apples to peaches to tropical fruit. What's harder to express is the wine's power to satisfy. Rich and lush, it swings for the bleachers and just misses, but it's a solid triple. Editors' Choice.",US
3449,US,"Ripe and racy, this single-vineyard wine has lots of sweet lime, white peach and kiwi aromas and flavors on top of a steely framework of crisp acidity. Oak adds buttery, creamy notes. A rich, complex combination.",US
3450,US,"Yummy. Exotically rich, ripe fruit marks this expressive, polished wine. Apple, peach, pear, vanilla, and toast highlight the aroma, and it drinks extravagantly rich without being over the top. The finish is complex and harmonious.",US
3451,US,"Made with fully ripened grapes, this is a lush, complex, thoroughly enjoyable wine. It's fairly dry by California standards, but offers up masses of sweet fruit and oak extract. The balance is especially nice; all parts are in harmony. Editors' Choice.",US
3452,US,"Sharp, tart and thin, with biting green apple fruit flavors. From a high-acid year in Washington, this definitely shows it.",US
3453,US,"Acidity marks this Chardonnay. It gives a tart, mouth-cleansing citrusy scour to the lemon and lime and pineapple flavors that finish so dry. It's a minimalist wine, with a minerally frame, and quite good with shellfish.",US
3454,US,"Nice and dry, with crisp, citrusy acidity and a touch of creamy oak. Shows savory flavors of Meyer lemons, limes and tingly Asian spices, with a touch of green apple butter. Clean and food-friendly.",US
3455,US,"Really nice, fragrant and floral with lovely clover and peach highlights. It's dusty and elegant, a truly stylish and very affordable Chardonnay. There's just a bit of sharpness in the finish, gently fading into toast.",US
3456,US,Tired and over the hill. It's an old Chardonnay losing its fruit and turning vegetal.,US
3457,US,"The vineyard is on the cooler western edge of Paso Robles, and this bottling has been getting better over the years. The '07 is the best yet, a dry, crisp wine of richness and polish. Shows pineapple, nectarine and guava flavors, with a subtle minerality, creamy mouthfeel, and a fine coating of smoky oak.",US
3458,US,"Fancy, with racy acidity and rich oak framing ripe natural flavors of pineapple brûlée, pear concentrate and Meyer lemon essence. Rich, but balanced and elegant.",US
3459,US,"Nicely dry, crisp in acidity, and with apple flavors streaked with a stony minerality, this Chard offers clean, everyday pleasure.",US
3460,US,"The core of this no-oak wine is medium-ripe fruit in the apple/pineapple mode. But a bitter, harsh aftertaste throws it off course, and it never recovers.",US
3461,US,"Dry, earthy and a little simple, this Chard has flavors of herbs, pears and oak, and is soft in acidity. For another two dollars, you're better off buying Beaulieu's beautiful Carneros Chardonnay.",US
3462,US,"From the Oak Knoll area, this is a super-oaky wine, bursting with vanilla and char. The underlying fruit isn't really big enough to sustain it, though. The wine is earthy and soft, leaving the oak to dominate.",US
3463,US,"A tightly structured wine marked by apple and peach flavors, but there's a young earthiness that keeps it from being a mere fruit-fest. Lush, creamy and complex, with real density and weight. Lots to like here.",US
3464,US,"A remarkably intense wine from vineyards located in the western hills of Salinas Valley. Made with grapes ripened enough to veer it into tropical fruit territory, but those telltale Monterey acids are bright as a bell. A solid dose of oak lends smoky vanilla and spice components. The result is a full-throttle wine, strong and flavorful. What it lacks in refinement it makes up in sheer exuberance.",US
3465,US,"Ripe and full-bodied with tiers of fruit flavors ranging from green apples and peaches to pears and mango. None-too-subtle oak adds vanilla, smoke and butterscotch elements. Just enough residual sugar for it to drink a bit like an orange-vanilla milk shake.",US
3466,US,"What a roll Fess Parker Winery is on with their '08 Chardonnays. Not only great wine, but priced so well. This wine, sourced from Parker's U Block in this famous Santa Maria Valley vineyard, is as rich as any Chardonnay of the vintage—just massive in pineapple, pear and buttered toast flavors. Yet it's crisp and tart, clean and bracing in its minerality. Only 115 cases produced.",US
3467,US,"This is all Birch Creek vineyard, barrel fermented, 100% malo, about one third new wood, one third one year, the rest neutral. It's a soft, fleshy, buttery, California style, but nothing overblown. There's plenty of new oak flavor, good ripe fruit, and enough acid to support the yellow apple and melon fruit.",US
3468,US,"A fine Chardonnay, which Ferrari-Carano can usually be depended on to produce. Shows crowd-pleasing flavors of pineapple jam, butterscotch, crème brûlée and vanilla custard. Easy to find, with 42,000 cases produced.",US
3469,US,"This Chardonnay marches to its own beat. It's not one of those oaky, ultra-ripe wines, but instead shows a dry, herb-infused minerality you might call Chablisian. Shows modest fruit flavors of pineapples, while the oak is restrained. Drink this elegant Chard now.",US
3470,US,"A very lush, fruity wine, if a bit soft, with flavors of pineapples, lemon custard, buttered toast and smoky vanilla. Satisfies for its richness and creamy texture.",US
3471,US,"Nice and oaky and rich, from a vineyard in the heart of the cool-climate southern part of Russian River Valley. Acidity stars, giving zesty balance to the ripe pineapple, green apple, Key lime pie and pear flavors. New oak, to the tune of 40%, adds an opulent touch.",US
3472,US,"Rich and appealing, a new bottling from the winery. All the parts have yet to knit together, but they're all good, and the wine should drink well by winter 2007. New oak frames tart green apple, pineapple, kumquat and cinnamon spice flavors that are heightened by bright, zesty acidity.",US
3473,US,"Rich and packed with spicy tropical fruit. New oak imparts smoke and vanilla notes. The texture is creamy and smooth, kind of custardy, with high acidity that makes it drink whistle-clean. A very nice wine.",US
3474,US,"A fine effort, brimming with bright, clean lemony fruit, as well as spiced apple, pear, and vanilla. It's light on the oak, and drinks very clean and supple, with impressive depth. Low alcohol (12.1%) keeps it light and enjoyable.",US
3475,US,"A small-production barrel selection from the estate vineyard, this fine wine is brilliantly rich and balanced, proving that Napa Valley can produce excellent Chardonnay. With pineapple, lemon, lime and buttered toast flavors, it's ultraclean in acidity and vibrant in minerals. While it's quite dry, it finishes with a rich flourish of honey.",US
3476,US,"Don't drink this beauty too cold with your lobster, crab or scallops. It has the weight of a noble wine, with minerality and creaminess giving shape and texture to the leesy, yeasty flavors of pineapples, Key lime pie and ripe pear purée. Aged in 40% new French oak, California Chardonnay hardly gets any better than this.",US
3477,US,"Here's a very dry, steely and streamlined Chardonnay. Brims with mineral-infused pineapple tart, buttered toast and honey flavors. Feels wonderfully elegant and balanced, and will pair beautifully with barbecued salmon. The vineyard is located on the so-called Santa Maria bench, one of the region's prime growing areas.",US
3478,US,"Good Chardonnay, rich and ripe and steely. That metallic thing shows up both in the crisp acidity and in the stony, pebbly tang that adds a piquant freshness to the pineapple, lime tart, tangerine and smoky custard-cream flavors.",US
3479,US,"Shows mouthwatering acidity and long hangtime flavors of pineapple essence, papaya, butterscotch, vanilla crème brûlée and toast, yet for all that richness, finishes dry. This is a good price for all that richness.",US
3480,US,"Oaky and ripe, with powerful tropical pineapple, kumquat, mineral and floral aromas and flavors. New oak adds smoke, vanilla and char. The bottom line is of a flavorful, acidic and elegant Chard with a lingering, spicy finish.",US
3481,US,"A crisp, fresh, medium-bodied Chardonnay, this is toasty and nutty but not overly vanilla-scented. Grilled peach and buttered sweet corn notes pick up citrus overtones that finish long and mouthwatering.",US
3482,US,"Flat, disjointed and aggressively oaky flavors all but cover up the hints of tropical/pineapple fruit. There's an undertone of gummy plastic through the finish.",US
3483,US,"Another flavorful Chard from a fine region and vintage. Aromas of tropical fruits, spices, oak, smoke and lees. Rich and fine in the mouth. The structure is particularly elegant, with crisp acidity, smooth tannins and alcohol all well integrated with the fruit. Gets extra points for harmony and balance.",US
3484,US,"Classic Highlands Chard, with very bright, pure, focused aromas and flavors of tropical fruits and spices. The flavors are strong and clean. Oak adds shadings of smoke, vanilla and buttered toast, and there's something creamy and leesy in the texture. A fine wine of some complexity, at a fair price.",US
3485,US,"Starts with classic California Chardonnay aromas, including ripe peach and tangerine, smoke, honey, buttered toast and a nice burst of creamy lees. It's very fruity (as you'd expect from this vintage) and sharp, with good acidity cleansing the palate. A very pleasant wine and well worth the price.",US
3486,US,"Here's another good Chard from a vintage that produced a lot of them. It's ripe and aromatic, with a depth of peach-apple fruit, spices and smoky oak. A hint of lees and a creamy texture add complexity.",US
3487,US,"If the grapes were any riper, they'd be doing chin-ups in the glass. A blast of pungent peach, green apple and cantaloupe notes is accented by new oak. That power carries over to the flavors. It might almost be too ripe for food. Definitely in the California style, like it or not.",US
3488,US,"From cool coastal vineyards, this wine shows an unusual degree of richness for this price. The nose offers tropical fruits and spicy oak, and the flavors are boldly fruity. It almost achieves a degree of complexity. All in all, a fine value. Best Buy.",US
3489,US,"Super-ripe grapes put their shoulder to the wheel for a highly extracted wine characterized by masses of peach and pear flavors. Oak contributes added spice, vanilla and smoke. It's as plush as could be, but it's also soft and a bit flabby. An impression of sweetness lingers in the finish.",US
3490,US,"Oak dominates this 100% barrel-fermented Chardonnay, giving vanilla crème brûlée and buttered toast notes, but they marry well with the pineapple and pear tart flavors of the fruit. The overall impression is flashy and elaborate. The grapes come from the highly regarded Nielson Vineyard.",US
3491,US,"The grapes come mainly from the Rancho Santa Rosa vineyard, which is a great one, source to many top-scoring Chardonnays over the years. The wine is brisk,  tart and clean, with rich, dramatic flavors of pineapple, lime, honeysuckle and buttered toast. Really elegant and wonderful, and should blossom through early 2012.",US
3492,US,"A super Chardonnay at a very reasonable price. The grapes come from two vineyards, Bien Nacido and Solomon Hills. The wine is fresh and fragrant, with brisk acidity giving a bracing feel to the citrus, nectarine and pear flavors. There's a minerality that adds structural integrity to the richness.",US
3493,US,"Chards from this vineyard always show a typicity of intensely ripe citrus and tropical fruits, backed with bracing acidity and a stony minerality. This bottling threatens to go over the top in apricot sorbet that may have a touch of botrytis, but it wisely pulls back into balance at the last moment. Will gradually lose fruit over the next 10 years, becoming nuttier and drier.",US
3494,US,"Beaucoup butter, caramel and toasted nut flavors; 80% of this reserve Chardonnay went through malolactic. It's got plenty of fruit power and acid; but it's mostly the French oak barrel flavors that stand out at this young age.",US
3495,US,"Big, oaky and loaded with butterscotch, this is a lush take on Chardonnay, mixing rich streaks of tropical fruit and pear with new oak flavors powered by buttered toast and butterscotch. It's big, broad and yummy – what more do you want?",US
3496,US,"Couldn't be riper or more powerful in flavor, a Chard that just detonates with explosive pineapple tart filling, honey, vanilla and crème brûlée. Could use a bit of subtlety, but fans of pure Chardonnay flavor will be delighted.",US
3497,US,"A rich, complex Chardonnay with apple and peach notes and a strong mineral component. A scent of something like gunmetal or flint follows through in the flavors and helps give the wine a steely backbone. A distinctive wine; very dry and crisp.",US
3498,US,"A likable, easy-drinking Chard that won't bust your budget, with plenty of ripe flavors and winemaker bells and whistles. It's got spicy, vanilla-accented peach aromas, and while it drinks a bit thin, it's got some class and style. The finish lasts for a pretty long time, with oaky, spicy flavors. This is a good value, especially from a top winery. Best Buy.",US
3499,US,"A very fine Chardonnay showing succulent flavors of pineapples, Meyer lemons and bracing minerals, with a rich honeysuckle and buttered toast sweetness. Flashy, impressive and an incredible value.",US
3500,US,"Great price for a Chardonnay this rich and attactive.Although the alcohol is relatively high, the wine feels balanced, with a proper tension between ripe fruit, oak, alcohol, lees and acidity. Offers savory flavors of lemondrop candy, pineapple tart and buttered toast.",US
3501,US,"Run, don't walk to buy up cases of this beautiful, well-priced Chardonnay. It's rich and sumptuous in vanilla oak and lees-inspired flavors of pineapples, pears and lime tart. Easy to find, with production of 17,496 cases.",US

3503,US,"A flamboyant, crisp Chardonnay made in the popular style of elaborately toasty oak and very ripe fruit, which combine to offer an almost pastry-like dessert taste. Floods the mouth with pineapple tart, Meyer lemondrop and vanilla flavors, with suggestions of kiwis, limes and green apples. Delicious and appealing.",US
3504,US,"This is an elaborate, oaky Chardonnay made in the popular style that has made California Chard such a success. It's rich in pineapple jam, apricot, buttered toast, vanilla and leesy flavors, and grows better as it warms in the glass.",US
3505,US,"Ripeness of fruit and tart acidity combine to make this a fine, drily elegant coastal Chardonnay. Beyond the great structure are savory flavors of pineapples and green apples, with rich notes of honeysuckle flower and a grounding tug of minerality.",US
3506,US,"A very good, delicious Chardonnay that's easy to drink, and whose richness suggests shrimp, scallops, lobster and similarly rich fare. Dry and crisp in acidity, it wows with pineapple marmalade, crème brûlée, buttered toast, vanilla, honeysuckle and mineral flavors, brightened with zesty acidity.",US
3507,US,"Nutty and melon-scented, this is a medium-bodied Chardonnay with distinct tangerine and spice components Lohr attributes to the “Muscat clone” used in this wine. Finishes with a flourish of buttery richness. This would pair beautifully with cold crab.",US
3508,US,There's not much going on with this thin Chard. The watery flavors and absence of fruit emphasize the acids and alcohol.,US
3509,US,"Crisp and clean; a bit leaner than you'd expect from South Coast grapes, veering into citrus fruits like grapefruit. New oak and lees aging adds complexity, but still, it's an angular, structural wine. Food will wake it up.",US
3510,US,"The vintage was particularly successful for Patz & Hall, which achieved ripeness and balancing acidity with a seemingly effortless touch. This wine is brilliantly clean and extraordinarily rich in pineapples, Meyer lemons, sweet limes and minerals. Grows better as it warms in the glass.",US
3511,US,"Morgan makes one of the best, most powerful Santa Lucia Chardonnays, and this less expensive bottling is a good approximation of their top tier.

3512,US,"Very rich, reflecting 100% barrel fermentation in partial new oak and 100% malolactic fermentation. Under the creamy lees and buttered toast are scads of pineapples, pears and papayas. The grapes come from the Nielson Vineyard.",US
3513,US,"This is a strong, oaky, ripe Chardonnay, grown on a mountain better known for Cabernet. It's powerful and intense in pineapple tart, pear marmalade, Meyer lemon and lime flavors that have been liberally oaked, and it shows the creamy influence of lees. Not particularly subtle, it's a wine you don't want to drink too cold.",US
3514,US,"There's not much, if any, oak on this Chardonnay, leaving the fresh, clean fruit flavors to star. Shows a rich array of pineapples, Meyer lemons, yellow apricots and peaches, with spicy, vanilla overtones. Elegant, and a good buy at this price.",US
3515,US,"Creamy and lightly toasty, this elegant Chardonnay mixes its melon/apple fruit with vanilla cream and toasted cracker. The acid feels natural and brings in suggestions of pineapple, with a nice smack of butter kicking out the finish.",US
3516,US,"This is an enomoursly rich Chardonnay that positively explodes in apricot jam, pineapple, vanilla custard and butterscotch flavors. It's balanced with crisp, cool-climate Carneros acidity that makes it tangy and clean. Easy to find, with 33,000 cases produced.",US
3517,US,"Here's a pull out all the stops, bells and whistles Chard that aims to compete at a high level. Barrel fermented in 80% new oak, aged on the lees and put through full malolactic fermentation, it's rich, creamy, buttery and exotically flavored in opulent toasted barrel and tropical fruits. I personally like this style, but others might find it too oaky.",US
3518,US,"Tropical fruit aromas mingle with toasted oak on the nose of this elegant wine from Finger Lakes pioneer Dr. Frank. On the palate, the wine offers appealing and balanced flavors of creamy vanilla, spice and vibrant, lively fruit, making it an excellent choice for everything from salmon to spicier Asian cuisine.",US
3519,US,"Geyser Peak's Reserve Chards have been pretty good lately, as they learn how to bring balance to grapes that ripen so easily. The '05 is plenty ripe, packed with jammy apricot, tangerine and oaky vanilla custard and butterscotch flavors. It's a rich, exotic wine, with good enough acidity for balance.",US
3520,US,"Shows the dried hay and light tobacco herbalness that sometimes accompany Carneros Chards, with riper notes of pineapples. When the oak kicks it, it brings smoke, buttered toast, toasted coconut and vanilla. This is a very dry wine to have with a wide range of foods.",US
3521,US,"Anything remotely resembling true Chardonnay at this price is rare, but here's one that succeeds, if at the most elemental level. It's got proper apple and peach fruit and the requisite amount of vanilla-tinged oak, although probably not from new French barrels. It's a tiny bit sweet, but hey, that's the way people like it. And it's very clean. All of which makes it a great value in   Chardonnay.",US
3522,US,"Lees and oak dominate the nose of this very ripe wine. The result is size: A big, rich, oaky, fruity quaff, it fills the mouth with flavors and palate impressions. At the same time, it's a one-dimensional wine; it assaults the senses, but on one plane. Finishes semi-sweet.",US
3523,US,"This is a very pure, fresh and clean Chardonnay. While it's rich in tropical fruit, pear, green apple and smoky oak flavors, it's also well balanced. Shows brisk, citrusy acidity and a firm stream of minerals.",US
3524,US,"Chappellet's secret is that Cabernet Sauvignon isn't the only thing they know how to do. Granted, their Chards have off years, but in general they make one of the valley's best Chardonnays. The 2008 is right up there with the '04 and '07. Ripe in pineapples, peaches and pears, it avoids the herbaceousness that can mar Napa Chardonnay. Very fine.",US
3525,US,"A pure, clean Chardonnay whose dry richness is balanced with cool-climate acidity and a citrus streak almost like Sauvignon Blanc. Shows pineapple and pear flavors that indicate the varietal, but then crisp, tartly acidic lemongrass and grapefruits kick in. The result is wonderfully food-friendly. Easy to find, with 10,600 cases produced.",US
3526,US,"A beautiful Chardonnay that shows ripe, long hangtime fruit flavors of pineapples, apricots, peaches and papayas, offset with clean acidity. Shows a touch of oak. Will satisfy Chard fans, and is super food-friendly with grilled salmon, shrimp, scallops.",US
3527,US,"A very good Chardonnay that displays admirable dryness and firmness of structure, with good fruit. Feels clean in the mouth, with a taste of cold steel that undergirds pineapple and buttered toast flavors.",US
3528,US,"Dry and richly oaked, with ripe flavors, this is a big Chardonnay. It shows massive flavors of pineapple custard, pear jam, butterscotch, buttered toast and caramel. A bit direct, but a crowd pleaser.",US
3529,US,"Dry and balanced, just 25% of this went through malolactic, it shows crisp apple, pear and citrus brightened with punchy acids. Just a hint of oak from aging in 25% new barrels.",US
3530,US,"A good collection of fruit flavors bring interest to this surprisingly ripe Chardonnay. Pineapple, green apple and light tropical fruits are set against pleasing barrel flavors of baked pear and glazed doughnut (really!).",US
3531,US,"A dry, and elegant fruit-forward wine. It was harvested relatively early, at lower brix, resulting in crisp acidity and succulent flavors of tart green apples and kiwis, with a tang of pepper and cinnamon. Delicious.",US
3532,US,"DDO's Chardonnay comes as close to white Burgundy as you will find in Oregon. Amazing finesse, with crisp, detailed aromas mixing flowers, peaches, melon and almonds. Impressive texture and a long, elegant and precisely-detailed path across the palate.",US
3533,US,"Here's an intense, nervy wine, brilliantly acidic, layered and rich. It has enormous lemondrop, mango and pineapple flavors and lots of smoky, vanilla-accented new oaky notes, and is creamy in the mouth. The finish is long, lush and spicy. This is a real palate flatterer.",US
3534,US,"From a value leader, another rich, creamy, toasty Chard, loaded with peach, apple and pear flavors and a lot of oak. Good acidity and a long finish, but it has a little too much sugar to be considered dry.",US
3535,US,"This well-known, widely-distributed wine offers round apple-toast aromas and a rich, soft mouthfeel. Apple, caramel and orange-tea flavors play on the palate and into the creamy finish, with its big, spicy oak. It's solid and satisfying in a very mainstream manner.",US
3536,US,"From this very noble vintage comes a bottling that is softer than the Camelot bottling but no less rich and fruity. Filled with tremendous fruit flavors—apples and peaches specifically—and ultraspicy, cinnamon notes from both the grape and the oak. Made in the fashionable style, round and sweet, although it's a little flat and lacks added dimensions.",US
3537,US,"From one of the best Chardonnay regions in the state, a cool-climate wine with pronounced peach, apple and tropical fruit flavors and a blast of zesty, spicy, smoky oak. Clean and crisp, with a creamy, rich texture. Finishes with a vanilla note. The package is marred by too much sugar; consumers love sweetness, but this one takes things a little too far.",US
3538,US,"A nice Chardonnay if you like really strong fruit and spice. Mouth-watering flavors of tropical fruits and super-ripe peaches, and a creamy, tangerine note that follows all the way through to the rich, slightly sweet finish. May be too big for some, but that's the style.",US
3539,US,"Made in the modern, ripe style, but with a greater degree of finesse than you might expect at this price. The wine is dry and crisp and minerally, with a clean mouthfeel, yet offers rich flavors of pineapples, green apples and peaches. Easy to find, with more than 12,000 cases produced.",US
3540,US,"Smells bright, citrusy and clean, an impression followed in the mouth, where intricate flavors of pineapple, lemondrop candy and Key lime pie turn spicy on the finish. The acidity is brisk; the wine did not go through malolactic fermentation. Just shows that a great Chardonnay doesn't need oak, although sur lies aging gives it a notable creaminess.",US
3541,US,"This is a really nice Chardonnay. Sebastiani knows how to make a balanced varietal wine, and this clean, ripe Chardonnay completely satisfies, with fruity flavors and a rich balance of creamy oak, coastal acidity and spicy oak.",US
3542,US,"What an amazing record Robert Young has with its Chardonnay, which has been famous as a vineyard-designate by Chateau St. Jean since the 1970s. As ever, the '03 is rich and opulent, soft in acids and instantly addictive for the purity of fruit. Peaches and cream star, with a baked meringue complexity that's simply irresistible.",US
3543,US,"Part of the Jess Jackson empire of wineries, Hartford has a stellar record over the years across everything it produces, and this Chardonnay doesn't disappoint. It's bone dry and high in acidity, with a stony minerality that frames controlled peach, pear and mango fruit. The wine has that hard-to-define quality of elegant class.",US
3544,US,"What a string of successes Byron's Nielson Chard has had over the years. As always, this is a high acid, mineral-filled wine, with a taste of lighter fluid riding over the pineapple, pear and kiwi fruit. Very dry, it should be considered for the cellar, if you're into aging the handful of California Chards that can handle it.",US
3545,US,"Although the grape sourcing on Overlook has changed, the wine's price has barely nudged over the years, and it still shows the polish and zest of all Landmark's Chardonnays. It's a wonderfully rich wine, finely balanced and rewarding.",France
3546,US,"A simple but likeable Chard, with pretty apple and peach flavors and lots of crushed hard spices, like cinnamon and nutmeg. Has a touch of smoky oak. The K-J style really hasn't changed much over the years: Pick the grapes ripe, keep things slightly sweet and get some wood notes in.",US
3547,US,"Looking for an inexpensive Chard with true varietal character and nutty, spicy, vanilla-tinged flavors from oak? Here's one. It's strictly no-frills, but it does offer a lot to like, and at a decent price.",US
3548,US,"A richly fruity, spicy, oaky wine that offers up plenty of what consumers like, in an everyday, affordable package. The fruit veers toward peaches and tropical fruit, and it's a little sweet. Seems flabby around the edges, but not bad for the price.",US
3549,US,"Starts with fruity, lush aromas of honey, apple, butter and cream, caramel, toast and smoky oak. Nicely layered flavors of ripe peaches and green apples and spices. A winemaker's wine that's just a tad sweet and soft, but very clean, with a swift, pleasant finish. Best Buy.",US
3550,US,"Ripe, oaky, but inexpensive Chardonnay often smells like lemon-lime soda pop, with a waft of spice and vanilla and a hint of smoke. This version tastes fruity and more than a little sweet, but it's not flat, thanks to vibrant acidity. It's geared to the American palate, at an affordable price.",US
3551,US,"A wonderfully drinkable Chardonnay that shows brilliant coastal character and lots of richness, at a decent price. Crisp and dry, it has elaborate flavors of pineapples, green apples, peaches, crème brûlée, buttered toast, vanilla and cinnamon spice.",US
3552,US,"Good price for such a nice Chardonnay from the Santa Rita Hills. The wine is very dry and crisp in acidity, with a bracing mouthfeel that offers rich, oak-inspired flavors of pineapples, pears and green apples. Nice now with Ahi tuna tartare or grilled salmon.",US
3553,US,"Brisk and ripe, this Chard, from a cool region on San Luis Obispo, shows a classic profile of pure kiwi and lime fruit flavor. A layer of oak adds caramel, butterscotch and vanilla flavors. It all finishes in a long, spicy swirl of orange blossom honey.",US
3554,US,"There's a minerality to this pleasantly dry Chard, a stony tang that dominates, although you'll find pineapple underpinnings. It's a leaner, more elegant style, and the winemaker has tried to enrich it with oak, sur lie aging and 50% malolactic fermentation.",US
3555,US,"This is a new, reserve-style wine from veteran Ferrari-Carano. It shows its cool-climate origins in the brisk acidity that boosts well-ripened pineapple tart, green apple sauce, and Key lime pie flavors. It's also extremely oaky, and would be a better wine if it had less barrel influence.",US
3556,US,"I found the winery's regular '04 disappointing. This commemorative bottling is oakier and much riper in tropical fruit flavors, with non-malolactic crisp acidity and a buttercream texture. Somehow, though, it lacks the power and follow-through a great Chard should have, especially at this price.",US
3557,US,"Lots of rich, ripe, forward fruit in this well-oaked wine, with tart green apple, pineapple, lime and kiwi flavors. It's stylishly dry, with a nice, creamy finish.",US
3558,US,"This wine really flaunts its stuff (and its oak aging) in its rich, creamy body and intensely luscious profile. Aromas and flavors of buttered brioche, baked apples, butter and light smoky spice fill out the nose and mouth, with notes of sweet vanilla-infused spice lingering throughout the long finish. Oaky, sure, but well balanced and delicious, too.",US
3559,US,"A really good Chardonnay that shows the classic acidity and dryness of the Sonoma Coast, with complex, pleasurable flavors. Pineapples, pears, apricots and guavas are the fruits, enriched with sweet oak, in a dry, balanced and elegant wine that could develop bottle nuance over the next 2–4 years.",US
3560,US,"Pleasant enough and Chard-like, with aromas of tangerine, peach and a kiss of honeyed oak. It's got enough residual sugar to almost fall into the off-dry category. Well made and certainly affordable.",US
3561,US,"Aromas of white peach and apple wood, with a dab of oak and butter. In the mouth it's very fruity and a bit sweet. The acidity is high and cutting. It's one-dimensional and finishes rough and earthy.",US
3562,US,"Soft and easy to drink, with pronounced fruity-spicy flavors and a solid dose of smoky oak. Quite sweet and soda-like, with a sugary finish.",US
3563,US,"Pleasant enough and Chard-like, with aromas of tangerine, peach and a kiss of honeyed oak. It's got enough residual sugar to almost fall into the off-dry category. Well made and certainly affordable.",US
3564,US,"Tastes of new oak and is also acidic, a combo that makes the mouthfeel rather harsh and salty, despite obviously well-ripened fruit. May settle down and show softer, lusher notes in a year or so.",US
3565,US,"Shows classic Edna Valley Chardonnay structure and flavor, a brightly acidic, minerally wine with a great burst of Key lime pie, ripe kiwi, pineapple custard, honey and vanilla oak flavors.",US

3569,US,"Very dry, crisp and minerally, a subtle wine with some bottle age that shows real complexity and finesse. Not for fruit-forward fans, its pineapple, pear and herb flavors are drying out, leading to interesting, old-wine, honey-and-cashew nuances. Drink right away, before it dies.",US
3570,US,"Made in the stylish cult manner of exceptionally ripe pineapple, kiwi and pear fruit flavors, lavishly oaked, this Chard will please fans of the style. One wishes it were more sophisticated and complex, but lots of people will ooh and aah over its sheer power.",US
3571,US,"The vineyard is on the Carneros border, and this Chard has lots of juicy acidity, which may also be due to the winemaker picking the grapes at a relatively low ripeness level. The pepper- and mineral-infused flavors suggest peaches and grapefruits, enriched with new oak and lees. This is an extremely dry, food-friendly wine.",US
3572,US,"Almost sweet in pineapple custard, marzipan and butterscotch flavors, and there may even be a bit of residual sugar in this honey-rich Chard. Saved by a crisp backbone of acidity.",US
3573,US,"Shows what is becoming the classic profile of unoaked, cool-climate Chard. Clean, crisp and minerally, the wine shows high-toned flavors of ripe kiwis, limes, passionfruit, pineapples, green apples, vanilla and cinnamon-spice. A match for scallops with mango salsa.",US

3575,US,"Offers a good modern interpretation of Chardonnay, with its ripe, oaky flavors and creamy texture. Grilled pineapples, mashed green pears, buttered toast, caramel and vanilla, brightened with crisp acidity.",US
3576,US,"From a vineyard that has a long track record of success with Chardonnay, this new entry is a bit sharp and toasty, perhaps just a bit young to be at its peak. The fruit flavors are light and bring green apple and melon into play; the oak tastes new and not yet well-integrated, but with time this should balance out.",US
3577,US,"Sharp and crisp in citrusy acidity, this Chard has jammy flavors of apricots, pineapples and vanilla oak. A little direct, but dry and creamy, and easy to drink.",US
3578,US,"Ken Wright is one of more than a dozen winemakers sourcing fruit from this exceptional vineyard. These 30-year-old Chardonnay vines are some of the oldest in the Northwest. Here they display substantial lime and citrus flavors, whiffs of honeysuckle and clover, light peach and some buttery richness in the finish.",US
3579,US,"Chewy, minty and firm, with full-bodied flavors of apricot and peach. The fleshy fruit is enhanced with sur lies aging in 40% new French oak barrels.",US
3580,US,"Stainless steel fermented and aged, to bring bright, acid-driven fruit to the forefront. Full-bodied and flavorful, with nicely mixed stone fruits, pineapple, green berries and lemony citrus. It sets up sharply on the palate and holds true, just waiting for some fresh shellfish.",US
3581,US,"Monterey Chards often exhibit this aroma, which makes you think you could pick them out in a blind tasting. The wine smells fresh and juicy, with Key lime pie and tropical fruit notes. In the mouth, it's rich, fruit-forward and oaky. This Chard is designed to dazzle.",US
3582,US,"Shows a Chablis-like steely, minerally dryness, with subtle notes of lemons, limes and grapefruits. Marked by firm acids, it's an elegant wine of great structure and integrity, meant for drinking now.",US
3583,US,"Very rich, dry and crisp in acidity, a Chardonnay that feels fine from your first sip through the spicy finish. Made with 35% new French oak, and aged eight months on the lees, it's drinking beautifully now, with pear, pineapple, vanilla custard and buttered toast flavors. Just lovely.",US
3584,US,"Nutty aromas reminiscent of cashews lead the way, followed up on the palate by more roasted nuts, white peaches and nectarines. Picks up some elegant citrus notes on the long finish. Based on a recent tasting of the 1997 Estate Selection (rated 90), this should improve over the next six months to a year.",US
3585,US,"Many wineries have taken fruit from this vineyard, generally with good results. The '05 Lucas & Lewellen shows its terroir, with a cool-climate crispness backing up ripe pineapple tart, nectarine and papaya flavors. But the oak-inspired caramel, char and butterscotch is a bit heavy-handed.",US
3586,US,"Here's your basic straightforward upscale California Chard. It's forward in tropical fruit and oaky butterscotch and vanilla char flavors, wrapped into a creamy texture. There's a touch of green in the finish, though.",US
3587,US,"A very nice Chardonnay that continues the winery's success with this bottling. Dry and creamy, it has rich flavors of pineapples, pears, vanilla and spices.",US
3588,US,"Never effusively fruity, Hendry Chards are characterized by polished herb and mineral notes, although there are underlying peach flavors. This ultradry wine is crisp and earthy, with a complex balance that makes you like it more and more as you sip.",US
3589,US,"Distinct for its powerfully intense lemondrop and lime pie flavors, this Chard also is rich and zesty in citrusy acids. Oak plays a supporting role, bringing toast and vanilla accents. Perfect with shellfish, especially cracked crab.",US
3590,US,"It's all in your face in this modern-style Chardonnay. Vastly ripe pineapple jam and tangerine flavors, enhanced with sweet vanilla oak and creamy lees, flood the mouth, making the wine superrich, although it's bright in citrusy acidity. Ready to drink now.",US
3591,US,"This wine is oaky; it's 100% barrel fermented and aged in new French oak for 12 months. Despite that, it's not over the top. Aromas of smoke and cured meats lead the way, then sweet pears. The texture is slick—even oily—and definitely viscous. Finishes long, with plenty of oak-imparted spice.",US
3592,US,"What a difference from Borghese's regular chardonnay.  This one is loaded with class and refinement, from the delicate aromas of light toast, pear and hazelnut through the nearly weightlesspalate that somehow carries a great deal of flavor.",US

3594,US,Aromas of apple and tropical fruit on this rich Chardonnay lead into vanilla and honey on the palate. The wine is full and opulent in the mouth but not overwrought. Good balance and a lingering finish add to the appeal.,US
3595,US,"There's a lot of crisp, vibrant acidity in this wine, which gives the pineapple, apricot and peach flavors a jamminess that lasts through the finish. With its creamy texture, it's a wine to drink now.",US
3596,US,"This Napa winery has been reaching into the Russian River for their Chardonnay, with good results. Dry and crisp in acids, the wine has a minerality behind the green apple, peach and melon flavors. The firm structure should provide for aging through 2009.",US
3597,US,"Smoky and meaty, with nut, white-peach and clove notes. Firm acidity allowed 100% barrel fermentation without the wine becoming overly soft.",US
3598,US,"Ripe and buttery, this reserve Chard from winemaker Eric Fry could hardly be more different from his White Label bottling. Superripe pineapple fruit is marked by plenty of oak-imparted spice. Lush and ready to drink.",US
3599,US,"Not much oak is evident in this polished Chardonnay. What stars is fruit, all pineapples, pears, tangerines, green apples and papayas, and the acidity that makes it all bright and clean. Great with pasta in a butter sauce with garlic and pepper.",US
3600,US,"Very ripe, rich and oaky, made solidly in the California style. Doesn't leave much to the imagination, but rewards for decadent pineapple, pear, crème brûlée, buttered popcorn and vanilla flavors.",US
3601,US,"A brisk, clean Chardonnay with a firm footing of minerals undergirding polished pineapple, pear and cedar flavors. Offers lots of sophisticated pleasure at a good price.",US

3603,US,"Ripe peaches, mango and citrus jump from the glass; there's no lack of lush fruit in this reserve. Oddly, despite barrel fermentation, the fruit completely overshadows any trace of oak. Juicy and ripe, with some slightly bitter citrus rind in the finish.",US
3604,US,"This is the middle tier of Wölffer's Chardonnay offerings, squarely between the top-of-the-line Estate Selection and the entry-level La Ferme Martin label. The Reserve exhibits plenty of buttered-pear flavors, complemented by faint nutty aromas and some toasty oak notes that gain steam on the finish.",US
3605,US,"Toasty, perhaps a little overly toasty, with lots of menthol notes. Still, there's an attractive nuttiness to the wine and solid pear and white-peach fruit.",US
3606,US,"A sleekly dry, minerally Chardonnay that shows a fine, steely structure, yet doesn't stint on fruit. The pineapple, pear and flowery honeysuckle flavors are accented with richer touches of buttered toast from oak barrels.",US
3607,US,"A little on the thin side, fruit-wise, although there's a wealth of toasty oak, and the wine possesses that bright acidity so associated with the vineyard and appellation. The flavors veer toward apricots and papayas. While official alcohol is only 14.5%, the finish is chili-pepper hot.",US
3608,US,"This is a balanced, easy to drink Chardonnay, with citrus, peach and green apple flavors that have been finished with a veneer of smoky oak. It's totally dry. Do not overchill it, as it's a delicate wine that needs some warmth to open up.",US
3609,US,"Byron's regular Chardonnay has historically been a very good wine. This continues that tradition, rich in tropical fruits, but extremely dry, with a stony minerality and high acids that stimulate the taste buds and call for rich fare.",France
3610,US,"If you're looking for a kosher Chard, try this one. It's a fine wine, rich in fruit, well-oaked and balanced, with the creamy, full-bodied mouthfeel you want in this varietal. The peach custard, pineapple and kiwi flavors are simply delicious.",US

3612,US,Rich buttery aromas are quickly supplanted on the palate by crisp flavors of pears and lemons. Shows good persistence on the finish. The combination of butter and citrus seems like a natural to accompany a basic beurre blanc.,US
3613,US,"Toasty and buttery on the nose, with an appealing nutty character. Turns more aggressively woody on the palate before finishing with bold buttered-popcorn flavors.",US
3614,US,"This medium-weight offering shows caramel and butterscotch aromas, slightly sweet apple-pear flavors and a soft, generous mouthfeel. Smooth vanilla and a touch of toast show on the finish.",US

3616,US,"Toasty, with mouthwatering aromas of lemon custard and crème brûlée. Medium-bodied, the oak seems a little less integrated on the palate, manifesting as a slightly bitter spice edge to the otherwise soft, almost pillowy, fruit.",US
3617,US,"Here's a brisk, bright and very flavorful Chardonnay for drinking with rich fare, like crab, pork, scallops or chicken in a buttery cream sauce. It's strong in acidity, with honeyed, creamy flavors of kiwi fruit, limes, pineapples and vanilla.",US
3618,US,"Shows the purity of flavor and structure that Bonterra wines are famous for. Ultraclean and racy in acidity, this Chardonnay stars ripe varietal flavors of pineapples, oranges and limes. A touch of oak adds welcome richness.",US
3619,US,"So fresh and inviting with aromas of apple cider, pear slices and pineapple core. More of the same unfolds in the mouth with soft accents of smoke appearing on the end of the finish. Balanced with medium weight and acidity; an excellent option for outdoor grilling, at an attractive price.",US
3620,US,"There's just too much oak on this otherwise fine Chard. It's like drinking toothpicks, all sweet vanilla char, toasted meringue and caramel. Too bad, because the underlying wine is filled with polished mineral and fruit flavors.",US

3624,US,"Here's a compact, young Chard that's tight in minerals and acidity, riding high over well-oaked tropical fruit and peach flavors. It's closed now, and should be allowed to breathe for a while. Drink now through 2009.",US

3628,US,"Offers ripe fruit—yellow peaches and golden apples—in a medium-bodied package that's virtually guaranteed not to offend. A good, versatile quaffer.",US
3629,US,"In only the winery's second vintage, this Chard offers a balanced experience with notes of ripe red apple, pear and pineapple core playing harmoniously alongside soft toast and vanilla flavors. The full, creamy texture is stopped from being too much by moderate acidity and a clean finish.",US
3630,US,"Soft and sweet, although there's a lot going on, taste-wise. Flavors of pineapples, peaches, pears and vanilla are wrapped into an oaky, creamy package. But the wine would benefit from more acidity and less sweetness.",US

3634,US,Shows the distinctly high acidity and laser-pure lemon and lime flavors that are so typical of this chilly appellation. You'll also find enriching oak and lees influences in this clean Burgundian-style wine.,US
3635,US,"These grapes were pushed hard: first for ripeness and low yields, then with barrel fermentation and plenty of new wood. The result is a rich, buttery, nutty wine with a core of white-peach flavors that never fully reveal themselves. Drink young before the fruit fades.",US
3636,US,"This 100% barrel-fermented Chardonnay sees only 20% new oak, so although it has plenty of buttered-pear flavors it finishes fresh, with a hint of citrus. A touch of anise adds complexity to the aromas.",US
3637,US,"Very tart and crisp, like biting into a green apple and adding a squeeze of lime. Pure unadulterated Chardonnay fruit that tastes similar to an unoaked Macon or Chablis. From Wölffer.",France
3638,US,"The barrel-fermentation shows in the buttery, toasty aromas that overlay pear and peach fruit. Orange and lemon flavors echo on the finish, so you know it hasn't been over oaked.",US
3639,US,"Very crisp, and loaded with tart green apples and lemons, this would be an ideal match for light fish or shellfish dishes. This is what unadulterated cool-climate Chardonnay tastes like.",US

3641,US,"Rich, ripe and oaky, this pleasant Chard offers pineapple, kumquat, honeysuckle and buttered toast flavors, with bracing acidity.",US
3642,US,"Call it Chablis-like. This Chard is bone dry, crisp in citrusy acidity, and features stony, minerally flavors of Meyer lemons and limes. Try as a richer alternative to Pinot Grigio.",US
3643,US,"Very ripe and oaky, but a little on the obvious side, with flamboyant tropical fruit, honey and buttered toast flavors. Could use greater finesse, subtlety, complexity.",US
3644,US,"Soft and flabby, especially on the entry, without the acidity to balance the very ripe pineapple, guava and vanilla-oak flavors. A wine this flavorful desperately needs crispness.",US
3645,US,"Pretty thin in fruit, which makes the bare-bones alcohol, acids and oak stick out.",US
3646,US,"Basic Chard, if thin, with just enough peaches and cream, vanilla and toast flavors to satisfy.",US
3647,US,Crisp pear and citrus fruit gets almost aggressively tart in this stainless-steel fermented Chard. Good length; should pair well with oysters on the half-shell.,US
3648,US,"With 20% barrel fermentation, this wine is surprisingly rich and spicy for a low-end Chard. The aromas and flavors bring to mind pears and golden-delicious apples, before turning tart on the finish.",US
3649,US,"The aromas bring to mind buttered cashews and pears poached in vanilla syrup. The flavors follow suit, in a medium-bodied wine that's soft and easy to drink but tails off a bit on the finish.",US
3650,US,"A nicely balanced wine with ample fruit flavors of soft peach and honeydew backed by hints of soft sweet spice and toast. Lemon rind appears on the palate and finish, lifting the medium-weight mouth and providing a crisp, clean close.",US

3652,US,"The underlying wine is very good, showing brisk acidity, a cool-climate minerality and long hangtime, ripe flavors of pineapples, crisp green apples, mangoes and limes. Yet the oak is heavy-handed, overwhelming the fruit with caramel, and making the finish too sweet.",US

3657,US,"A blended white, but predominantly—you guessed it—Chardonnay. The soft, sweet pear aromas and flavors are simple and clean, making this a decent quaffer on a hot summer day.",US
3658,US,"There's some light toast and vanilla flavors layered over modest Bosc-pear fruit, but a lack of intensity holds this wine back despite a generous mouthfeel and ample structure.",US
3659,US,"Toast aromas accent ripe pears and golden-delicious apples in this soft, easy-to-like Chard that only lacks a bit of depth. A slightly bitter note on the finish should become less noticeable over the next few months.",US
3660,US,"A well-balanced barrel-fermented Chardonnay with harmonious notes of apple, toast and lemony citrus followed by a slightly nutty, vanilla-kissed finish. Moderate weight with a voluptuous mouth countered by vibrant acidity; easy to drink, just not very unique.",US
3661,US,"Shows the dryness, crisp acidity, flowers and minerality that often mark Carneros Chadonnays, which makes it elegant and sleek. With a touch of Meyer lemons and limes, it rises to richness.",US
3662,US,"Earthy and minerally, and very dry, this Chard has a scour of high acidity. It's a lean wine, by the usual fruity standards, but a clean, complex one, rather Chablisian in its way, and might improve with some time in the cellar.",US
3663,US,"Made in a very ripe, extracted style, this eccentric wine has flavors of apricots, or more precisely, apricot marmalade on buttered toast, because it's also oaky. It's dry and crisp in acids. A bit unusual, but in its own way, a good wine.",US
3664,US,"Made in a very dry and acidic style, this wine has flavors of limes, honeydew melons and buttercream. It's tight and minerally, with a tart, high-acid finish, and seems designed to complement food.",US
3665,US,"Has everything the best Chards have, without quite the same complexity or depth, of course. But's it's a value for the rich pear, peach and pineapple flavors, creamy smooth texture, and sumptuous overlay of oak.",US
3666,US,"The oak contributes buttered toast, butterscotch and caramel flavors to this dry, crisp wine, but the underlying fruit isn't strong enough to support all that weight. Shows only modest flavors of pineapples, kiwis and minerals. Disappointing.",US
3667,US,"This is not a very good Chardonnay. It's thin and simple, with syrupy flavors and a heavy hand of oak.",US
3668,US,"The underlying wine shows real Santa Barbara Chard character of crispness and ripe, juicy fruit, with flavors of pineapples and peaches. But a huge, major flaw is excessive oakiness. All that caramel and butterscotch throws this otherwise likeable wine out of balance.",US
3669,US,"Simple and gluey, with canned tangerine and apricot flavors and an unnatural oaky taste.",US
3670,US,"Syrupy, with candied apricot flavors and a sugary finish.",US
3671,US,"This wine shows some of the less appealing aspects of American oak: overt spice and vanilla flavors and a slick, oily mouthfeel.",US
3672,US,"Apple-cider and earth aromas open to a simple apple-toast palate. The mouthfeel is even, the finish dry and rather woody. Then again, there are few drinkable California Chardonnays of this age.",US
3673,US,"This wine shows some of the less appealing aspects of American oak: overt spice and vanilla flavors and a slick, oily mouthfeel.",US
3674,US,"Vanilla, butterscotch and some harsher oak-derived compounds dominate the modest citrus fruit that might have been wine before it was turned into oak juice. For wood lovers only.",US
3675,US,"A rich and developed Chard with notes of toasted brioche, almond skins, lightly baked red apple and orange oil on the nose and mouth. Well balanced with a full but not flabby mouth, moderate acidity and a lingering finish.",US
3676,US,"A well-balanced, partially oaked Chard with aromas of wood-grilled red apples, smoke and a hint of black licorice backed by flavors of toasted challah and tangerine citrus. Ample acidity keeps the palate and finish lively and clean.",US
3677,US,"From up in the Chalone highlands comes this very dry, acidic and rather earthy Chard. It has peach and apricot flavors, with a touch of green tea and tannins. Seems like it has the structure to age, although that has got to be considered a gamble.",US
3678,US,"This simple Chard has likeable, intense flavors of lemons and limes and other tropical fruits, such as guavas and nectarines. It's very dry, and the finish is rich in clean, bright, palate-stimulating acids.",US
3679,US,"First bottle corked. Second bottle sound, but rather one dimensional. The fruit is simple green apple and green berry; but there is a distinct earthy undertone that carries into the finish. If new oak barrels were used, they are not evident.",US
3680,US,"Nasty and sharp, with candied LifeSaver flavors that have a weirdly medicinal, over-oaked taste.",US
3681,US,"This has a rich earthy quality, suggesting sweet heaps of mulch and herbs, in addition to fruitier flavors of apples and peaches. It's also somewhat soft and well-oaked. If you're looking for an example of Napa Chard, for better or  worse, this is a good one.",US
3682,US,"Parker's basic county Chardonnay shares the same features as his upper tier, namely a wonderful balance of acids, fruit, oak and alcohol. The flavors are of tropical fruits, although the wine is necessarily not as rich or concentrated as the single vineyards.",US
3683,US,"This is a fresh, vibrant stainless steel-fermented Chard that boasts charming notes of fresh apple slices, nectarine, lemon rind citrus and a hint of yellow florals. It's ripe and big without being too spicy or overdone, with a solid, lengthy finish. Drink now.",US
3684,US,This single-vineyard Chard with no oak has a light bouquet with nuances of white florals and red apple. The palate offers more heft and concentration with flavors of peach preserves and clementine supremes. Lower alcohol with a medium-length finish; rich and tasty without being overdone.,US
3685,US,"A well-made wine with a creamy texture and long finish, infused with aromas and flavors of buttered toast, grilled peaches, apple skins and almond shells. Balanced and not over-oaked; an excellent choice for hearty chicken pasta dishes and bisques.",US
3686,US,"A nice, relatively inexpensive Chardonnay to enjoy with fish, pork and chicken. Dry and creamy, it has flavors of pears, guava and spicy vanilla.",US
3687,US,"Dry and zesty in acidity, this Chard offers flavors of apricots, green apples, pears and butter cream. It's pretty good for this everyday price.",US
3688,US,"Here's a really good Chardonnay: Crisp, delicate and dry, it shows great acidity and brilliant fruit, saturating the palate with pineapple tart, Key lime pie, vanilla cream, crème brûlée and cinnamon spice flavors. Finishes with the deliciously creamy, yeasty complexities of lees aging.",US
3689,US,"Past Chardonnays from this vineyard have been more opulent, and it's a curiosity why the winemaker shied away from ripeness this vintage, when it should have been easy. The absence of richness makes the acidity and alcohol stand out. It's a good wine, just something of a disappointment.",France
3690,US,"A bit common, with a scoury texture and decent flavors of pineapples, apples and oak, with a very dry, acidic finish.",US
3691,US,Quite big and decadent smelling as notes of caramel-drizzled apple pie with vanilla ice cream on top emanate from the glass. The mouth is full and milky with solid acidity supporting the rich flavors of toasted brioche and smoky apple. A solid choice for dishes that can match its intensity of flavors: think lobster newburg or crab thermidor.,US
3692,US,"For ten bucks you get a dry, crisp and tasty wine, brimming with apricot, pineapple and vanilla flavors, wrapped into a creamy texture. This is a good price for a Chardonnay of this quality.",US
3693,US,"Light and oxidative, with soft, toasty buttery flavors. The fruit is hidden behind all the buttered popcorn flavors. It's drinking well enough at the moment, but aging very quickly.",US
3694,US,"The coolness of the site and the vintage has yielded a young, tart wine that fans of big, fat Chards might find lean and austere. But it's a grand wine for Burgundy lovers. Acidity is high, and there's a stony minerality undergirding the citrus, wildflower and smoky oak flavors. This is one of those rare Chards that needs some time to come around. Best 2008–2011.",US
3695,US,"Like the winery's other 2005 Chardonnays, this one, tasted in March, is tightly wound and minerally. The aroma will show little if the wine is too cold. Flavor-wise, hints of tart tangerines, lemongrass, green apples, candied ginger and vanilla cream swirl into a smoky oak, spicy finish. This is a Chardonnay that needs some time in the bottle. Drink now and for a couple of years.",US
3696,US,"Charry, smoky oak stars in this young, well-structured wine, leading to powerhouse peach pie (with the crust), lemon mousse and buttered toast flavors that finish long and spicy. Acidity is high, and gives a tangy minerality that adds complexity.",US
3697,US,"The golf legend lends his name to this everyday, simple Chard. It has fruity flavors and a creamy texture, with smoky notes, and is dry and balanced.",US
3698,US,"Fruity and oaky, with rich flavors of pineapples, pears, buttercream, vanilla cookie and toasty meringue. Crisp acidity provides clean balance.",US
3699,US,"The nose is lively and jumpy with notes of tart gooseberry, Granny Smith apple, lemony citrus and a hint of fresh ginger. The mouth offers riper, more oaky flavors of toasted nuts and pear flesh that lead through to the finish. Well balanced and easy to drink; so approachable, an excellent choice for outdoor summer dining with company.",US
3700,US,"This Chard offers a delicate but intricate bouquet with aromas of apple, vanilla spice and tropical acidity. The palate shows more floral and ripe red apple flavors, with a moderate weight in the mouth and a balanced finish. A solidly made and easy-to-enjoy wine.",US
3701,US,"Right now my preference between Mondavi's Reserve and regular Chard is the regular. This is a better wine, from a classic Chablisian point of view, but it needs time. It's firm and deep in fruit, with an impressive minerality, and the balance for aging. Lay this Chardonnay down for two to four years as it gains some bottle complexity.",France
3702,US,"This unoaked Chard has a somewhat Chablilsienne quality to it, with a beautiful mineral-driven freshness supported by delicate aromas of white peach, green apple and lively orange citrus. Light and immensely refreshing, it's a perfect apértitif sipper to be enjoyed with cheese and crudité.",US
3703,US,"Nicely balanced with attractive aromas and flavors of ripe stone fruit, lightly charred red apple and limey citrus. The mouth is round and lush but not fat, with moderate acidity keeping the weight in check and leading the way through the medium-length finish. Great for company alongside goat cheese appetizers.",US
3704,US,"Sweeter smelling than the usual Chard, with peach preserves, lychee, pear and pink florals unfolding in the bouquet. The mouth offers more oak-driven balance, with notes of cedar plank and spiced pears filling the cream-textured mouth. Seals the deal with a lingering, toasty finish.",US
3705,US,"Oak sticks out on this Chardonnay, striking with buttered toast, vanilla and wood char notes that dominate the underlying wine, which has perfectly fine citrus and tropical fruit flavors.",US
3706,US,"Sweeter, more developed aromas of caramel, candied red apple, Boston baked beans and honeydew develop on the nose, while the mouth shows more typical Chard notes of baked apple and hazelnut butter. A touch round and flabby, but ends with a long, delicious, vanilla-kissed finish.",US
3707,US,"Super-rich in tropical fruit, pineapple, apricot, pear and vanilla custard flavors, this is a useful, crowd-pleasing Chardonnay at an affordable price.",US
3708,US,"Tastes a bit tired, with apricot and pineapple flavors that are losing their fruity flesh, showing herbal bones. Dry and crisp, it's unlikely to improve with further age.",US
3709,US,"A pretty nice Chardonnay at an affordable price. Dry and crisp, it shows pleasant flavors of pineapples, pears, peaches, vanilla and buttercream.",US
3710,US,"Silky and crisp, with those long, penetrating Edna Valley flavors of ripe kiwis, Key lime pie and intense vanilla. Shows real elegance and flair, and this is a good price for the quality.",US
3711,US,"Tastes kind of thin and simple, with watery flavors of peaches, alcohol and oak that finish quick. But it's a clean, balanced wine.",US
3712,US,"Bitter oak, a sugary mouthfeel, and an earthy, chunky, pineapple candy-flavored palate.",US
3713,US,"Dainty and nuanced with notes of honeydew melon and red apple skin in the bouquet followed by flavors of stone fruit and peach. Moderate weight and acidity, with vibrant citrus carrying the refreshing finish.",US
3714,US,"With 12 months in French oak, the Reserve Barrel Fermented Chardonnay is a rounder, more spice-infused Chard than Macari's regular Estate Bottled offering. As big as it is, the nose is somewhat muted with soft notes of pear and yellow flowers and the palate shows more as a result of the oak (spice, toast) than the fruit.",US
3715,US,"A decent everyday Chard, with ripe flavors of pineapples, peaches and pears, and an oaky influence of vanilla and buttercream.",US
3716,US,"Nice and dry, with brisk acidity framing pineapple, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors, boosted with a touch of smoky oak.",US
3717,US,"Give this youthful wine some time to settle down. Tasted in late March, its parts had yet to mesh. The acidity, oakiness and fresh grapy flavors are at some odds with each other. By winter of 2007, it should be a fine, complex Chardonnay, and drink well for five years.",US
3718,US,"I liked Morgan's Double L Chard for its Chablis-like character. This wine is more so. It's drier, more acidic and more elegant, but there's nothing lean about the power of its core of tropical fruit, which detonates on the palate and doesn't stop. There's fascination with every sip, as the wine slowly changes in the glass. This is a great wine and showcases the infinite possibilities of this appellation.",US
3719,US,"Not very subtle, but oaky and ripe, with strong flavors of pineapple jam, pear, vanilla and toasty oak. Made in the popular style, at a decent price.",US
3720,US,"A medium bouquet of apple, lemon and a touch of fresh young peach. The oak is there but not overpowering. The palate is well structured with good acidity and a medium weight followed by a lengthy finish.",US
3721,US,"A vitamin pill scent greets you immediately, somewhat masking the fruit. In the mouth it's rather light, watery and showing green apple fruit with plenty of acid. The finish softens up but doesn't add any depth or flavor.",US
3722,US,"Nice, dry and complex, a crisp wine with quite a bit of minerality undergirding the fruit and oak. Feels fine and balanced in the mouth, and should take a couple years in the cellar.",US
3723,US,"This is a new brand for me, and they're off to a promising start with this dry, minerally Chardonnay. It packs a punch with upfront lemon and lime, passion fruit and pineapple flavors that are pushed forward by great acidity, while oak adds a fine appliqué. This wine is notable for its balance, elegance and sheer deliciousness.",US
3724,US,"If you like 'em big and oaky, then this one's for you. Aromas and flavors of wood-grilled peaches, roasted red apples, buttery toast and rich nuttiness all generously abound. The mouth is full and slightly fat, with moderate acidity and a medium-length, smoky finish.",US
3725,US,"A little heavy and dense in oak and lees, which tamp down the fruit and give the wine a certain flatness. Nonetheless you'll find grace notes of pineapples, apricots and minerals.",US
3726,US,"Tries for Burgundian richness, but ends up rather common, although it will satisfy fans of buttery, oaky Chardonnays. Shows ripe flavors of pineapple jam, apricot purée and buttered popcorn.",US
3727,US,"A very distinctive Chard—full of character and even eccentricity. There are strong, up-front aromas of tangerines, vanilla, butterscotch, smoke, ripe peaches and caramel. It's especially notable for the thick, creamy texture and a penetrating, spicy clove note that follows through on the long, rich finish. A complex, serious wine.",US
3728,US,"Deep, layered aromas of smoky honey, lees and the ripest peaches. In the mouth, it's satisfyingly complex: dry, with a huge blast of fruit, honey, spice and a creamy texture. The finish lasts a long time.",France
3729,US,"A little on the watery-thin side, with apricot and pear flavors. Finishes dry and crisp in cool-climate acidity.",France
3730,US,"This wine carries a new label, very spare; the drawing of house and vineyard is gone; it's all white with simple type. The wine is simple, soapy, light and showing just a watery impression of citrus, banana and tropical fruits.",US
3731,US,"An everyday Chardonnay, useful for a wide variety of purposes. Shows a creamy texture with flavors of apricots and citrus.",US
3732,US,"Here's a polished, delicate wine that shows the poise and elegance that Carneros Chard can achieve. It's varietally pure, with pineapple, mineral and toast flavors that finish dry, a wine meant to enjoy with food, rather than star on its own. Easy to find, with 31,000 cases produced.",US
3733,US,"They didn't let any malolactic fermentation into this wine, a wise decision because you wouldn't want it to be any softer. Still, there's a prettiness to the ripe green apple, honey and toast flavors, which are complexed with layers of tropical fruits, spices and lees.",US
3734,US,"Call it Chablisian for its high acidity and dry minerality, with suggestions of herbs and mushrooms that create a deep undertow to the brighter peach and pineapple flavors. This is a powerful, very complex wine, easily able to handle its share of new French oak.",US
3735,US,"Barrel fermented and aged in American oak for 15 months, this is a big and powerfully oaky Chard with dominating notes of butter, wood-infused stone fruit and apple pie along with a hint of grapefruit oil in the mouth. The finish is toasty  with a lingering vanilla bean note.",US
3736,US,"Aged 14 months in Russian Oak, this is a different kind of Chard with notes of chamomile, fresh mint sprigs, vanilla and cigar tobacco among the more typical melon fruits and lime citrus. Medium-full but a bit flat in the mouth with a solid but quite smoky finish.",US
3737,US,"A little dainty on aromas with hints of nectarine, honeysuckle and licorice. The mouth is ripe and rich with notes of roasted red apple, orangey citrus and a touch of mealy stone fruit. You get a bit of heat on the finish that fades fast and leaves the other fruit flavors lingering.",US
3738,US,"This Chard has always been dependably rich, and here's another tasty offering, with powerful scents of tropical fruits and Oriental spices, and leesy-smoky notes of butter and vanilla. You'll especially enjoy the creamy texture, accented with peach, pineapple and spicy-buttery flavors. The finish is long and rich, too.",US
3739,US,"Strong , complex aromas, with notes of tropical fruit and coconut. In the mouth, it's oaky and spicy, with penetrating, bright, effusive flavors that you might go so far as to call racy. The alcohol content is high and it drinks a little soft, but this is a very seductive wine. A crowd-pleaser, for sure.",US
3740,US,"This ripe, lovely wine shows classic Russian River Valley aromas of ripe, sweet, green apples. The winemaking adds smoky, vanilla-scented oak, a creamy, leesy smoothness and a rich softness that owes to malolactic fermentation. What strikes you, though, is the balance. All the parts come together in this super-enjoyable wine. At this price, it's a great value.",US
3741,US,"Ripe, tropical fruit aromas mark this spicy, well-made wine. The aromas veer toward breadfruit, mango and even banana, with Oriental spice notes of ginger and cinnamon. Drinks rich and powerful, with up-front fruit, and finishes long and spicy.",US
3742,US,"This is the workhorse release from an always dependable producer, and it's excellent. Not enormously complex or layered, but very ripe; it offers up-front peach flavors veering into tropical fruit, with a solid dose of smoky oak that adds nuance. Vibrant and alive, with high acidity that endows it with marvelous structure.",US
3743,US,"Will satisfy Chardophiles with its oaky, creamy flavors and notes of pineapples, lemons and limes. Finishes dry and crisp in acidity.",US
3744,US,"Dry and crisp in acidity, but a little tired, even though it's less than three years of age. Shows dried fruit and tobacco flavors that are turning mushroomy.",US
3745,US,"Tastes over-oaked and under-fruity, with green, stalky flavors along with Lifesaver candy pineapples and lemons. Gets the Chardonnay job done, just barely.",US
3746,US,"Tastes like apricot pie filling, mixed with vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg spice, with the smoky pastry crust. Simple and direct.",US
3747,US,"Creamy and oaky, with butterscotch and pear notes, but heavy and a bit unripe, with vegetal notes.",US
3748,US,"A little heavy and syrupy, but for twelve bucks, you get a creamy wine with pineapple jam and vanilla flavors.",US
3749,US,"What's so nice about this wine is that it has full-throttle Chard personality while keeping everything so balanced that it's also a versatile food wine. You can't say that about a lot of Chardonnays. Mainly it's the acidity, but also the complex, subtle interplay of fruit and oak. A very nice job.",US
3750,US,"A little softer than K-J's Camelot Highlands, but no less delicious, with similar lemon drop and custard flavors and a tinge of sweet, ripe pear. The mouthfeel is round, creamy and full-bodied, with a complex veneer of toasty oak.",US
3751,US,"Though there's no oak on this Chard, it's still quite rich and ripe with loads of honeydew, yellow peach slices, lightly baked apple and tangerine oil. The mouth is round and lacking a bit more acidity, but as a whole the wine is enjoyable and easy to drink.",US
3752,US,"Fresh and fruity with dominating notes of green apple, young white peach, chamomile and sweet grass. Lime citrus appears in the mouth and on the finish, livening up the moderate weight and medium-length finish.",US
3753,US,"A rich, creamy wine, loaded with personality. Spicy, oaky aromas ride over tropical fruit and peach scents, and it drinks crisp and spicy, although the midpalate is a little thin in fruit. The oaky sweetness is very nice, and so is the whistle-clean finish.",US
3754,US,"With this wine, Callaway takes a step away from its longtime Temecula appellation and toward the increasingly well-regarded Coastal designation. The wine is a little oakier than Callaway's previous bottlings and the fruit is lean, tending toward grapefruit and green apple. It's crisp and ultraclean, and a good value.",US
3755,US,"If you didn't know the price and had to guess, you'd probably figure this wine would cost about $18. It's enormously ripe and fruity, with bright peach, tropical fruits and spices and quite a bit of oak. The technical notes say it was partially barrel-fermented. A wine of enormous charm and a great value in Chardonnay.",US
3756,US,"The vineyard is in the interior part of the appellation, toward Carneros, and the wine displays the firm, acidic minerality of that cool, foggy region. It has fantastic limpidity. The oak is remarkable for the purity of vanilla and smoky honey, while the underlying flavors of Meyer lemons, pineapples, nectarines and kumquats are decadently good. A masterpiece of Chardonnay.",US
3757,US,"Zelma Long consults with winemaker Caleb Foster, and this beautifully detailed wine shows her distinctive stamp. Barrel fermented in used Burgundy barrels, with no acid or water additions. Lees stirring adds creamy, light flavors of butterscotch, balanced against crisp green apple and pink grapefruit.",US
3758,US,"Starts a bit chemically, but that blows off to reveal minor fruit notes of red apple flesh and mushy melon. Light and prickly in the mouth with a medium-length finish. Growing a little tired; drink now.",US
3759,US,"Made in the popular style, with rich, ripe pineapple jam and kiwi fruit flavors enhanced with the sweet vanillins of oak. A good Chardonnay at a fair price.",US
3760,US,"A touch on the delicate side with very soft aromas of white peach, melon and barely browned toast. The palate is light but round with ample flavors of apple core, hard nectarine and citrus rind. Fulfilling and enjoyable without being overdone; pair with chicken or crab salads.",US
3761,US,"White Merlot? Why not? It's actually a deep rose color, with fresh, exuberant aromas of raspberries and wildflowers. Drinks fruity and clean, with nice strawberry and raspberry flavors and just a tad of sugar. The finish is pretty.",US
3762,US,"With a hefty case production, the wine is light and thin, but there are pleasant enough flavors. It's average Chardonnay, with just enough appley fruit, oak and sweetness to satisfy. It's clean and well-made, and there's not much more you can say about it.",US
3763,US,"A blast of clean, ripe citrus, peach and pear fruit greets you from this well-made, if simple, wine. There are vanilla and smoke elements from wood. It's a little soft, and a tad off-dry, but if you need a case of something white to quench the throats of party-goers who aren't real particular, this is the ticket.",US
3764,US,"From a dependable producer and a fine vintage comes a problematic wine. The fruit is nicely ripe and suggestive of apples and peaches, and it's balanced and dry. Acidity is adequate. The only jarring note is a strongly toasted character, almost like charcoal, which you can both smell it and taste. Even the finish is marred by this burnt flavor.",France
3765,US,"High acidity marks this vibrant wine, which is from one of Kendall-Jackson's coolest coastal vineyards. The crispness lends a vibrant tension to the intense flavors of Meyer lemons, orange blossom and minerals, while oak adds softer, spicy notes. Feels racy and nervy all through, in a delicious way.",US
3766,US,"Here's a big, sumptuous, fat, oily Chardonnay, massive in tropical fruits, spices, minerals and smoky buttered toast. The creamy texture makes it feel especially rich. Aged in 57% new oak, it's truly a decadent—but balanced—Chardonnay.",US
3767,US,"This sure is an oaky Chard, but it's big enough to handle it. The fruit is extraordinarily ripe and forward, bursting with mango, pear and sautéed banana flavors. What the wine lacks in subtlety it makes up for in sheer, unadulterated power.",US
3768,US,"Lots of vanilla, spice and buttered nuts, set in a tight, stylish frame. Clean citrus and apple fruit, made in a fresh, crisp and penetrating style.",US
3769,US,"Ordinary and one-dimensional. The grapes got superripe under the California sun, offering big flavors of pineapples and peaches, liberally accented with oak. But there's not much going on below the surface.",US
3770,US,"There's not a whole lot going on in this Chard, with muted aromas of overripe peach and hints of mealy pear in the mouth. A touch flabby but the finish is clean and the balance solid. The label peels off like a sticker for easy record keeping.",US
3771,US,"The aromas of this wine are a touch honeyed with notes of baked apple and sweet smoke. The finish is medium length, but the alcohol comes through a bit too aggresively.",US
3772,US,"Here's a nice everyday drinking wine with some real richness from ripe Chardonnay grapes and a touch of toasty oak. It will satisfy that craving for apple and peach-flavored fruit. Dry and spicy, with the creamy texture of a good wine, but it won't break the bank.",US
3773,US,"This is a very fine Chardonnay. It displays crisp acidity that boosts and brightens ripe flavors of pineapples, pears, green apples and kumquats. Oak adds welcome notes of smoke, buttered toast and spice. Only 25 cases were produced.",US
3774,US,"A huge, complex wine that flatters the palate with enormously rich, layered flavors of lemondrop, vanilla custard and butterscotch flavors. Fortunately, there's crisp Central Coast acidity.",US
3775,US,"Too sweet, almost like a dessert wine, this Chard has sugary flavors of pineapple custard, with caramelized wood vanillins. Could use greater balance and subtlety.",US
3776,US,"A decent price for an everyday Chardonnay that gives people what they like in this variety. It's rich in pineapple jam, pear and honey flavors, with an elaborate coating of sweet oak.",US
3777,US,"Simple and sweet, like a fruit juice blend of apples, peaches and pineapples you buy in the supermarket.",US
3778,US,"Though a bit lead-footed, this Chard throws up some nice cream, honey and clove aromas. While the palate is swamped with vanilla, nice baked apple flavors come through on the finish before fading to a popcorn note.",US
3779,US,"Here's an easy-drinking Chard that provides notes of pear, melon and small white flowers. The acidity is vibrant in the mouth, but the finish falls a bit flat in the end.",US
3780,US,"Yummy Chard, complex and delicious. Offers lots of ripe, rich peach and pineapple custard flavors, sweet, toasty oak and a buttery texture. Nice, perky acids keep things lively and clean.",US
3781,US,"Bright and lively in acidity and pure fruit, brimming with ripe peach, lime and quince flavors. Oak forms a seasoning, with suggestions of vanilla and toast. A well-balanced wine that will go well with food.",US
3782,US,"From the wildest, most remote and exotic stretch of the Sonoma Coast: you can taste the salt of the sea in this wine, as you can in a Manzanilla Sherry. It gives a tang to the lemondrop, pear and honeysuckle flavors, with their lick of cold granite. So pure and vibrant, so savory, so compelling. Grows more fascinating with every minute in the glass.",US
3783,US,"Lots of ripe tropical fruit in this wine, with pastry-filling pineapple, peach, butterscotch and vanilla spice flavors. Although technically dry, it has a richly honeyed finish.",US
3784,US,"A little one-dimensional and on the soft side, but enormously rich in apple butter, pineapple custard, apricot jam, gingerbread, vanilla honey and sweet oak flavors.",US
3785,US,"There aren't many Chards from this hilly Mendocino area. This wine shows dryness and ripeness, with a stony minerality undergirding peach custard and pineapple tart flavors, enriched with a satisfying touch of smoky oak.",US
3786,US,"Here's a minerally, acidic, very dry Chard with a firm structure. Slightly earthy, it has citrus fruit, smoky oak and spice flavors, with a wet stone, metallic tang in the finish.",US
3787,US,"Old-vine Kestrel Vineyard fruit delivers; this is excellent juice. Concentrated and lush, it's packed with pineapple, green apple, hints of pear and light tropical fruits. A fruit-driven, powerful wine, with cracker and oatmeal flavors showing up in the finish.",US
3788,US,"Oaky, supple and structured, this features fresh green apple fruit and plenty of toasty new oak. It's just well made, mostly barrel-fermented (one-third was new French oak) and captures the broad, fruit-driven, barrel-enhanced flavors that make Chardonnay so popular.",US
3789,US,"What's likeable about this wine is that it doesn't go for the cheap thrills of superripe fruit and form of oak flavoring so common in Chards of this price. What you get is a dry, minerally wine, with a firm spine and just enough peach and oak to make it rich and complex.",US
3790,US,"Shows the limpid quality of Carneros Chard, with its crisp acidity and tang of minerality. The fruit veers toward green apples and pineapples, and as good as it is, the palate needs to be a little stronger and more concentrated.",US
3791,US,"Marked by a lean minerality, this Chablis-style wine is not one of those fat, opulent Chards that dazzles with sheer richness. It's more subtle than that, and more acidic. Structure, in fact, is the name of the game here, with its lemon and lime flavors that barely break into green apples. Fine now, if not served too cold, and for the next 2–4 years. Beyond that, wines of this kind go quickly downhill.",US
3792,US,"Pure and detailed, this lovely Chardonnay carves its way through the palate with layers of pear tart, apple crisp, brioche and almond paste. It is an elegant wine, light and penetrating, with a finish that seems to linger forever.",US
3793,US,"This soft and seductive wine is reminiscent of a good Chassagne-Montrachet from a relatively warm year. It has the same ripe, lightly tropical fruit, inflected with citrus and buoyed by firm acidity. The use of oak is restrained, the balance perfect, and the finish long and satisfying.",US
3794,US,"Not a bad Chard from this warm Central Coast region. It's a little rough around the edges, but is dry and creamy, with a nice mingling of fruit and oaky elements.",US
3795,US,"Still quite young yet unmistakably lush, this bottling immediately shows fresh apples, white peach and plenty of new oak from 100% barrel fermentation. The lip-smacking acidity keeps fruit and oak in balance; all that is needed is a bit more bottle age. Decant it if you plan to drink it immediately.",US
3796,US,"As always, a nice, easy-drinking Chard with plenty of Central Coast character. The cool, long hangtime has given very ripe fruit, while preserving vital acidity. The winemaker brings a deft touch of oak.",US
3797,US,"Here's the latest entry into the red-hot unoaked Chardonnay category in America, and it's a solid hit. Dry and crisp, it's rich in apricots, pineapples, tangerines and spices.",US
3798,US,"Everything is clean and properly varietal in this well-made wine, which is dry, creamy and a little bit oaky. Could use greater fruity concentration, though.",US
3799,US,"O.K. Chard, but pretty thin, especially for this prestige appellation. The plaster of oak is too strong for the fruit. The flavors are of lemon candy and oak.",US
3800,US,"This is not the Calcaire that was so famous years ago. It feels stretched and pulled and thin, like a Chard one-third its price. Barrel fermentation and sur lies aging are all very nice, but the fruit just isn't there to justify this price.",US
3801,US,"A beautifully elegant, refined Chardonnay. Because it's not overloaded with oak, it displays the basic finesse of the grapes from this cool-climate vineyard. Crisp and dry, it's rich and complex in citrus, tropical fruit, peach, mineral and honeysuckle flavors, at a fair price.",US
3802,US,"A little on the thin side, this wine has modest green apple, pink grapefruit and vanilla char flavors. It's bone dry and crisp, with a fast finish.",US
3803,US,"Decent everyday Chard, but disappointingly thin, especially for a reserve. All the parts are here, from the creamy mouthfeel and oak to the pineapple and nectarine flavors, but it's like a photocopy of a photocopy.",US
3804,US,"A bit on the weedy, sharp side, with some prickly acids. Has just enough peaches and cream flavor to satisfy Chard lovers.",US
3805,US,"There's a lot of oak on this wine, or maybe the wood just dominates because the fruit is so thin. Either way, it's clean, lean and dry.",US
3806,US,"This is not the best example of unoaked Chard. Without any enriching barrel notes, the wine shows raw, thin fruit, citrusy and green.",France
3807,US,"Some green, herbal flavors thin down the apricots and peaches in this simple wine, while the oaky overlay is too strong for the meager fruit.",US
3808,US,"Good price for a firm, steely Chardonnay that's elegant and dry through the finish. Minerals and citrus fruits mark it, with a Meyer lemon tartness given added richness from 25% new oak fermentation. Ready now.",US
3809,US,"Sweet and soft, with apricot, peach and butterscotch flavors.",US
3810,US,"Rustic, soft and sweet, with apricot and oak flavors. Gets the Chard job done in a simple way.",US
3811,US,"Awkward and overoaked, with apricot flavors and deficient acidity, which mars the slight sweetness.",France
3812,US,"With this wine Iron Horse takes a giant step toward great Chablis. By that I mean the intense dryness and zesty acidity, and the tangy grip of iron and wet stone that undergirds the Meyer lemon, pineapple zest, honeysuckle, apricot, cinnamon spice and new oak flavors. This Chard is all about structural integrity. It should have a useful life of at least six years, gaining momentum and nuance.",US
3813,US,"Oak sticks out on this Chardonnay, with the aroma and flavor of buttered white toast dominating. But there comes an immediate rush of pineapples, limes and peaches, giving the wine a good balance of wood and fruit, and it's very dry and crisp. At its best now, but don't serve too cold.",US
3814,US,"Showing the depth and nuance that mark great Chardonnay, this benefitted from its chilly location in the Petaluma Gap in this hot vintage. The coolness allowed the grapes to achieve maximally ripe tropical fruit, nectarine and peach flavors, while preserving vital acidity. Extra dry and elegant, it's a Chard that can take up to six years of cellaring without missing a beat.",US
3815,US,"I love this for its absolute dryness and crispness and minerally depth. There's something coldly metallic in the taste and mouthfeel, and to the extent there's fruit, it's of grapefruits and lime zest, with a flowery exoticness. Sur lies aging and toasty new oak have added richness and layers of subtle nuance. Strikes you for the sheer excellence of its balance. Enjoy now–2010.",US
3816,US,"Nice and dry, with smoky oak framing tropical fruit and peach flavors, finishing with Asian spices. With its crisp acids and rich fruitiness, it's a natural for shellfish or creamed chicken.",US
3817,US,"What great structure you get in this quintessentially food-friendly wine. Absolutely dry, it shows a crisp mineralityF to the pear, pineapple, toasted meringue and sweet, charry oak flavors, and the finish is amazingly deep and long. This is really an impressive Chardonnay.",US
3818,US,"Iron Horse joins the unoaked Chard bandwagon with this dry, complex wine. Their estate grapes are so good, the wine doesn't even need all that wood. It's elaborately tailored in pineapple, mango, ripe white peach and spicebox flavors. The vanilla and smoke, which have got to come from the grapes, add extra deliciousness.",US
3819,US,"A smashing success, this exceptional value is loaded with the typical fruit flavors of cut green apple, pineapple and melon. The fruit is set in a creamy frame and finished with beautifully restrained oak accents that support it without burying it.",US
3820,US,"All the buttered toast, vanilla bean, apricot jam and pineapple crème brûlée you could want is here, but this lovely Chardonnay is lifted above the ordinary by a minerality that gives it a refreshing tang. Crisp acidity also helps to provide structure to the richness. Will have a short life as evidenced by some overripeness on the finish, so enjoy now.",US
3821,US,"A supple, supremely elegant wine, displaying its diverse flavors across a fine mesh. Very pretty aromatics carry a pleasing dustiness, accented with floral, sweetly spicy high notes. The tart fruit mixes citrus, tangerine, pineapple, green apple and pear, and finishes with nicely balanced toast and butterscotch.",US
3822,US,"Very dry and a little earthy, with a dusty hay or dried straw quality to the tangerine, sweet lime, lychee, peaches and cream flavors. An interesting, crisp Chard with plenty of nuanced complexity.",US
3823,US,"As is usually the case, Bernardus's regular Monterey Chard offers lots of bang for the buck. Dry and crisp in citrusy acids, it has complex flavors of pineapple, grapefruit, kiwi, lime and spicy coconut macaroon, with delicious oak influence.",US
3824,US,"Made in the modern, ripe California style of exceptionally ripe fruit, accented with strong oak. Not especially subtle, but flattering to the palate, with opulent flavors of pineapple crème brûlée, peaches, cream, buttered toast, vanilla bean and honeysuckle.",US
3825,US,"Clean and varietal. The fruit tastes of ripe apples, pears, and maybe a little bit of pineapple, and if there is new oak it has been gracefully melded into the wine so it does not stick out. Just a hint of sweet toast adorns the smooth, lingering finish; then fades with a lick of butterscotch at the tail end. A graceful, elegant debut for this new Walla Walla winery.",US
3826,US,"Fruit from moe than 20 vineyards went into this three-county blend. The result is a beautiful wine. Dry and spicy, it has lush pineapple, vanilla custard, tapioca, peaches and cream and gingerbread flavors, and a lush, creamy texture. Notable also for the crisp, brisk mouthfeel.",US
3827,US,"The chardonnay is the largest production wine made at Barnard Griffin. It is a stellar wine, about half barrel fermented, the other half stainless; a beautiful blend of crisp, fresh, creamy, leesy, textural white peach and light citrus fruit. Consistent in style with the winery's Fumé the Chardonnay has plenty of clean acid, great fruit, and a nice butterscotch finish in the back of the throat.",US
3828,US,"The grapes got real ripe, to judge by the bright burst of yellow apricots and exotic passionfruits. At the same time, acidity is crisp and citrusy, and there's a pleasant yeasty character, like Champagne, or a nice fino Sherry. The wine finishes totally dry, leaving a palate impression of great elegance. Drink now through 2010.",France
3829,US,"This is certainly a better Chard than the winery's '04. It's richer and more succulent, overall more rewarding in varietal fruit, including peaches and cream, pineapples, guavas and papayas, with a cinnamon spice finish. The wine also is characterized by crisp, crunchy acidity that makes it racy.",US
3830,US,"Here's a dry Chardonnay, notable for its firm structure. Acidity and oak tannins provide the framework for the candied Meyer lemon, mango, floral, mineral and buttered toast flavors. There's a touch of bitterness in the finish that suggests very modest aging. Drink now through 2008.",US
3831,US,"Easily the richest of Schug's current trio of Chards, showing the elegance and crispness of the other bottlings, but with more fruity intensity. It's still a fairly restrained wine, rich in acidity and dry minerality, but rewards with pineapple custard and butterscotch flavors.",US
3832,US,"This is yet another superripe, rich and luscious Chardonnay from Chateau Ste. Michelle. It's a tropical fruit-flavored California take on Washington terroir. Plush, smooth and plump, it nonetheless carries its weight well, with an especially fine, lingering finish.",France
3833,US,"A very limited production wine from a new Walla Walla vineyard, this was barrel fermented in neutral oak and softened up with partial malo. It leans a bit more toward the citrus/pineapple flavor side than does the winery's regular Chardonnay bottling. This is a bit crisper, with subtle grassy highlights adding some lift and interest.",US
3834,US,"This is a deep gold, scented with cooked apple and pear, and showing some soft, oxidative character from extended barrel fermentation. It is quite accessible, soft and forward, with light hints of tropical fruits leading into a smooth, lightly toasty finish. Definitely a drink-now Chardonnay.",US
3835,US,"Lots of acidity in this crunchy wine; this is so tart it's almost like fresh-squeezed lime juice. Fortunately, creamy lees and plenty of new oak add softer, sweeter notes of buttered toast and vanilla.",US
3836,US,"Chardonnay is the sweet spot in the white wine lineup (along with Riesling, of course). Big, bright and buttery, with plenty of legit oak highlights—none of this fake vanilla or microwave popcorn excess. Bacon fat, smoke and toast match the big, round, rich fruit.",US
3837,US,"Oaky, supple and structured, this sturdy Chardonnay is built upon clean green apple fruit and nicely layered toasty oak. It's the same formula as before: one third new French oak, one third malolactic, and nicely expresses open, fruit-driven, barrel-enhanced flavors with crisp citrus fruit.",US
3838,US,"Soft and creamy, this is consistent with the previous vintage and sets the stage for the winery's bigger, oakier single-vineyard Chardonnays. Mixed stone fruits, pineapple and an elegant, full-bodied mouthfeel make this particularly appealing for the price. It uses the oak judiciously, and avoids the overdone vanilla flavors that many inexpensive New World Chardonnays rely on.",US
3839,US,"Notable for its dryness and minerally tang, this is a tight, young Chardonnay right now. The flavors veer toward grapefruits, with notes of passionfruit and honeysuckle. The wine has gone through malolactic, but it's still an acidic wine, almost lean, but elegant. Call it Chablisian.",France
3840,US,"From this little RRV sub-region, this is a superdrinkable Chard with lots of interesting characteristics. It has a soft-sharp feeling, a buttery crispness, and the flavors, while on the modest side, are rewarding in tropical fruits and apricots. Finishes dry and complex.",US
3841,US,"Alderbrook is one of those insider wineries that does a good job at a fair price. This crisp, dry Chard is an elegant example of the long hangtime '05 vintage, with spicy tropical fruit, butterscotch and vanilla cream flavors.",US
3842,US,"Shows rich, racy acidity in a dry wine whose flavors veer toward ripe pineapple-tart filling, cinnamon spice and butterscotch, wrapped in a creamy texture. Would score far higher if the fruit were more concentrated.",US
3843,US,"Rewards for its rich, spicy oak, flamboyant flavors, and the crisp, juicy acidity that characterizes this cool coastal appellation. Pineapples, guavas, kiwis, limes and ripe peaches flood the mouth, leading to a dry, clean finish.",US
3844,US,"Brisk and dry, this Chard show an acidic brittleness to the tropical fruit, citrus and hay flavors. It makes up for in balance and elegance what it near misses in sheer pizzazz.",US
3845,US,"Big, bold and a little obvious, this Chard's main feature is oak, and plenty of it. Smoky and charry, the wine also has big fruit, along the lines of apricot jam, peach cobbler and pineapples. Don't drink it too cold.",US
3846,US,"The reserve Chardonnay is primarily taken from Atlas Peak, but like the regular Chardonnay is entirely barrel-fermented. Hints of butter, marshmallow and spice on the nose give way to flavors of citrus custard and melon on the palate. Finishes with some spicy oak notes.",US
3847,US,"Ripe and oaky, with juicy pineapple marmalade and butterscotch flavors balanced with crisp acidity, and a dry finish. Easy to like this creamy Chard.",US
3848,US,"Sourced primarily from the estate's Carneros vineyards, this is entirely barrel-fermented in French oak. Yet the oak provides gentle accents rather than an outsized coating. Pineapple fruit is lightly touched with hints of vanilla and butter, turning crisp and lemony on the finish.",US
3849,US,"A little light in flavor, but dry, crisp and balanced. The flavors are of pineapples, green apples, nectarines and oaky butterscotch.",US
3850,US,"This is ripe and heavy, with apricot jam and toast flavors. Might show more personality by autumn.",France
3851,US,"Thin, dry and acidic, this shows modest peach and citrus flavors. It's a good wine, and elegantly structured, but really should have greater fruity intensity for this price.",France
3852,US,"This $13 wine is quite fine, deep in color with a rich, flinty nose. It's big and full with drops of honey throughout and a layer of acidity on the finish. Modest in alcohol too.",US
3853,US,"Labeled “Stainless Cuvée,” this stainless-steel-aged Chardonnay is definitely European in style. A fine contrast to Rulo's toasty Walla Walla cuvée, this has minerally apple and citrus flavors. It's delicate but full flavored, with concentration and length.",France
3854,US,"There are enticing hints of berries and cream on the bouquet. On the palate, a floral note mingles with apple, lemon and just a dash of vanilla spice. This is full bodied and substantial in structure.",US
3855,US,"Flavors of creamy vanilla pudding, buttered toast and pineapple jam mark this slightly sweet Chardonnay. A crisp streak of acidity provides much needed balance to the richness.",US
3856,US,"Dominated by sweet oak and sweet fruit, this Chardonnay is made to appeal to consumers who enjoy the popular style. This tastes like orange and lemon jam, with body from the alcohol.",US
3857,US,"Few wineries produce an Oakville Chardonnay. This is a soft and heavy effort, with apricot and tangerine flavors.",US
3858,US,"As sweet as a dessert pastry, with vanilla, cream, toast, butter and pineapple jam flavors. Vibrant acidity provides balance just in time.",US
3859,US,"Everything about this Chardonnay speaks of class. It's dry and superbly structured in acids and tannins, and shows a chalky minerality that lends substance to the tropical fruit and honeysuckle flavors. Two Sisters is assembling a great track record with this bottling.",US
3860,US,"Shows the usual Williams Selyem Chardonnay profile of huge fruit and flashy oak. This opulent wine would be over-the-top except that it's balanced by crisp, lemony acidity, and somehow retains a tight core with a gravitational tug that keeps the richness focused. Impressive now for sheer power, and should hold well for another 5–6 years.",US
3861,US,"This is appealing for its richness, but it's heavily oaked with buttered toast and butterscotch flavors that overwhelm the underlying fruit. Too bad, because it's a nice Chardonnay with bright pineapple and orange flavors supported by fine acidity.",US
3862,US,"This is a good wine, but it relies too much on oak, overwhelming it with buttered toast and caramel. The result is a rich but unbalanced wine, with underlying orange, pineapple and peach flavors.",US
3863,US,"Chardonnays this rich need crisp acidity, minerality and a dry finish to balance them. That is exactly what you'll find in this beautiful example, from one of the appellation's best vineyards. It's bountiful in oranges, apricots and mangoes, with plenty of buttered toast, yet there's a mouthwatering tartness that makes you reach for another glass.",US
3864,US,"Fine acidity and a bracing minerality, like a lick of cold steel on a winter day, mark this Chardonnay. It has oak notes, but they're wisely kept in the background, allowing the citrus, green apple and peach flavors to star. This beautiful wine continues the winery's string of great reserve Chardonnays, and is their best since the 2006 vintage.",US
3865,US,"This wine shows good Chardonnay character, from the creamy texture to the notes of buttered toast, vanilla, lemons and limes.",US
3866,US,"A very rich Chardonnay, explosive in lemon custard, grilled pineapple and the ripest peaches imaginable. At the same time, there's a firm, tangy minerality. Some will find, however, that the oak dominates it all with a blast of buttered toast and caramel.",US
3867,US,"This is a very opulent Chardonnay, the kind fans of the variety will like for its array of orange, pineapple, vanilla cream, buttered toast and spice flavors. The honeyed finish is especially long and rich.",US
3868,US,"Sommeliers will love this Chardonnay for its lean, Chablis-like elegance. The lemon and passion fruit flavors stand alongside stony minerality and a leesy, sourdough bread tartness, while the brisk acidity makes the mouth water. Elegant rather than opulent, this gathers momentum as it warms in the glass.",France
3869,US,"Made in the popular style, this will find plenty of fans. It's sweet and creamy in buttered toast, pineapple and pear flavors.",US
3870,US,"Made in a style to appeal to the masses, this is a soft, sweet Chardonnay. It's rich in vanilla cream, pineapple and orange jam and buttered toast flavors.",US

3877,US,"Foxen's UU bottling is practically an insurance policy for great Chardonnay in any vintage. With 2012, the winery was granted a balanced, even harvest, with the resulting wine showing brisk acidity and subtle fruit and mineral flavors, touched with sweet oak. It defines a cool-climate style of Chardonnay in a most delicious way.",US
3878,US,"Carabella's estate-grown Chardonnay is generally done in a rich, flavorful style. Here it drifts over into a bit of volatility, with hints of nail polish in the aromas. Oily, nutty, and tasting of ripe tropical fruits, it's a stylized wine that will suit some tasters to a 'T'.",US
3879,US,"The winery held this Chardonnay back a year later than their far more expensive Journey bottling. Hard to say why, but the consumer is the beneficiary. That extra bit of aging has mellowed the wine, giving it a creamy, buttery richness. It has good acidity, too, that gives a lift to the ripe tropical fruits.",US
3880,US,"Josh Jensen brings his restrained hand to this very fine Chardonnay. It's notable for the excellence of all its parts, and the balanced way they co-exist. You'll find tantalizingly rich tropical fruit and peach flavors, with nuances of oak, as well as the minerality that the estate vineyard brings to all its wines, white and red.",US
3881,US,"Sourced from the oldest vines in the Willamette Valley, just two barrels were made of this wine. It's smooth, rich and elegant—a mix of pineapple and citrus—with light hints of coconut and toast. There's good concentration in the finish, heightened with citrus rind phenolics.",US

3892,US,"Darkly charred wood mingles with scents of coconut, dill and sweet spice on this heavily-oaked Chardonnay. Hints of smoke and hazelnuts seep into the palate as well, but serve to highlight fresh, fruity flavors of pear, lemon and orange rind. This finishes on a slightly-bitter wood note.",US
3893,US,"While the nose on this Chardonnay is decidedly savory, with notes of cooked apples and buttery cheese rinds, the palate is surprisingly feminine, with pretty orange-blossom and apple jelly notes. Opulent and fruity, yet refreshingly-balanced in alcohol and acidity.",US
3894,US,"Rich and full bodied, this abounds with pretty flower, sweet peach and pear aromas mingled with a toasted oak. It's decidedly oaky on the palate, with an abundance of smoke, vanilla and coconut notes. Generous in body, this has nicely extracted apple and lemon flavors. Drink now.",US

3903,US,"This eccentric Chard marches to its own beat. It's drier and more acidic than most, and the flavors offer a mélange of peaches, oranges, tropical fruits, Meyer lemons, cashews and white flowers. Yet it's delicious and compelling. Made with full-throttle techniques that include partial barrel fermentation, malolactic fermentation and battonage, it was bottled unfined and unfiltered. The vineyards are Sierra Madre, in the Santa Maria Valley, and Oaks Savannah, in the Santa Ynez Valley.",US

3912,US,"This is a cool-climate Chardonnay that's dark gold in color and tastes of ripe apple. From both the Ferrington and Savoy Vineyards, two of Anderson Valley's finest, it shows the greatness of the vintage in coastal Mendocino. Fragrant and rich in honey and toasty notes, it finishes crisp. Crab cakes with it would be ideal.",US
3913,US,"Neither oak aging nor malolactic fermentation was used here, hence the name. But far from madness, this wine is sleek, sensual, skillful and seductive. Crisp acidity, lemony minerality, an overriding freshness and excellent depth of flavor all combine to create a wine that seems to be more than the sum of its parts.

4221,US,"Made by Karl Wente for golfer Annika Sorenstam, this Chardonnay is luxuriously big, oaky and full of vanilla, caramel, ripe apple and lime characters and very good for its style. Textured and looking for buttery lobster rolls or similar such fare to pair itself with.",US

4291,US,"Very limited, this is a relatively new project from second generation winemaker Jason Lett. It is sourced from “the oldest vines in the Willamette Valley”—presumably Eyrie vines planted in 1965, and finds similar territory as the Eyrie reserve, with a bit more richness through the midpalate, partly from more expressive barrel flavors.",France
4292,US,"An elegant, compelling Chardonnay, its fruit accented with lemon, honey and lime. Low cropping of Dijon clone 76 has concentrated the flavors (and the alcohol—a surprising 15.7%) without turning the wine into an overblown fat boy. Nuanced and long, it is one of the most satisfying Chardonnays to come out of Oregon in recent memory.",US
4293,US,"A block selection from the estate, this is an intense, flattering Chardonnay. It has aromas and flavors of oranges, green apples, limes, kiwi fruit, buttered toast and spices, with a firm minerality. Brisk acidity brings welcome balance to the richness.",US

4299,US,"Lots of acidity gives this Chardonnay a real bite, while the fruit is very ripe, expressive of pineapples, tangerines and Meyer lemons. The result is a flavor of sour yellow candy, enriched with the creaminess of lees and a buttered toast note from the oak barrels. Drink with rich, buttery shellfish entrées.",US
4300,US,"Tastes tired, with jammy tropical fruit flavors starting to drop out. Still shows vibrant acidity, but the fresh fruit character, the most likeable part of such Chardonnays, is disappearing, replaced by more herbal and vegetal notes.",US
4301,US,"This is as good as the best from California—textural, creamy, a delicious mix of lemon custard, meringue, caramel, papaya and toasted coconut. At one quarter the price of comparable bottles, this young wine just seduces from the instant it hits the tongue.",US
4302,US,"Spectactular Chardonnay, so pure, clean and delicious. Defines the cool coastal climate of the Sonoma Coast, with brilliant, citrusy acidity brightening long hangtime flavors of tropical fruits, green apples and succulent peaches and pears. A stunningly good, upscale Chard to drink with very rich fare, such as ricotta cheese-filled gnocchi with grilled rock shrimp and Parmesan cheese.",US
4303,US,"This Chardonnay is defined by structural qualities, such as linearity and angularity. This is due to the joining of its minerality with acidity. It's a very elegant, drily austere wine, yet rich in grilled pineapple and buttered toast flavors. Should blossom slowly in the bottle over the next 6–7 years, one of the rare California Chardonnays that can take some age.",US
4304,US,"A very rich, flamboyant Chardonnay. Almost goes over the top in tropical fruit, vanilla custard and oak flavors, with a sweet finish. But crisp acidity and a steely minerality rein it in. Drink now.",US
4305,US,"The label includes the words “Original Vines” written along the side, a nod to the history of this limited reserve, gleaned from vines planted by founder David Lett in 1965. It's steely and sharp edged, with sculpted fruit and limited use of new oak. Cellarworthy and distinctive, this wine rewards your attention and patience with unexpected layers of detail.",US
4306,US,"Apple, pear and melon flavors taste like they're soaked in rose water. It's an all-purpose, rather nondescript effort, with just the slightest hint of toast on the finish.",US
4307,US,"Rich flavors of peaches, pears, buttercream and toast appear in this dry Chardonnay, which shows no signs of tiredness, although many 2007s do. The chief problem is excessive softness. It lacks balancing acidity and brightness.",US

4312,US,"A peachy, fruit-forward, mouthfilling wine that brings bright Washington fruit—peaches, apples and pears—into play, along with caramel candy and underlying acid support. It falls short only in the finish, which turns slightly bitter and attenuated.",US
4313,US,"This wine doesn't offer a lot aromatically at first but opens nicely to lemon, lime and vanilla flavors. The moderately priced, moderate in alcohol Chardonnay is bright and clean overall and a very good value.",US
4314,US,"A rich, ripe, oaky style of Chardonnay. Explosive in pineapple, tangerine, lemon and apricot jam flavors with buttered toast and honey. It's almost as sweet as a dessert wine.",US
4315,US,"This Chardonnay has plenty of ripe pineapple, pear and tropical fruit flavors. Having aged in 100% new French oak barrels, it offers rich notes of vanilla and buttered toast. Like all of Smith-Madrone's wines, this has great acidity and minerality, and even some tannins. Give this some time, and see how it is after 2017.",US
4316,US,"Direct and strong in pineapple and pear jam flavors, this Chardonnay also has notes of vanilla and buttered toast.",US
4317,US,"Shows the dryness, acidity and tightly wound minerality of all Hanzell's young Chardonnays, but with a depth of citrus and apricot fruit that marks it as a reserve. It really warrants time in the cellar. Best after 2013, and should develop for several more years.",US
4318,US,"Diana's is Testarossa's best barrel blend from its various vineyards from around the coast, hence the California appellation. It's certainly ultrarich, almost decadent, with the apricot, pear and honey sweetness of a late-harvest dessert wine. Yet its thoroughly dry, and finishes with clean, minerally acidity. Deserves its reserve-level price.",US

4321,US,"Shows the racy acidity and brilliantly ripe flavors of the winery's finest Chardonnays. The pineapple, mango, pear, lime and green-apple fruit purity is massive and impressive. There's a sweet vanilla note that must come from the grapes, as no oak ever touched this lovely wine.",US

4323,US,"A simple, soft, oaky Chardonnay made in the modern style. Tastes sugary sweet in apricot, pineapple and peach jam flavors.",US
4324,US,"Dry and somewhat herbaceous, this Chardonnay has some good pear, melon and orange fruit, but otherwise is missing out on opulence, especially at this price. New oak, to the tune of 40%, contributes buttered toast and caramel, but the wine needs more than that.",US
4325,US,"Entirely barrel fermented in French oak, just half the wine went through malolactic fermentation. It's a good call; the remaining acidity lifts the buttery banana fruit flavors, and prevents the wine from going all soft and flabby. Definitely a butterball style, with toasted nuts and popcorn flavors front and center.",US
4326,US,"Made in the modern California style, new oak dominates this Chardonnay. Even though unused French barrels accounts for only 30% of the blend, the aromas and flavors of buttered toast, vanilla and caramel swamp what otherwise seems like a good, crisp, tropically fruited wine. Earns an extra point for fine minerality, the result of its pedigreed vineyard originis.",US

4328,US,"The Helix Chardonnay is a lush offering of pineapple flavor, plus a leesy, mineral-soaked midpalate that is supremely refreshing. It has terrific acidity and persistence on the palate.",US
4329,US,"Big and bold, this Chardonnay is made from fruit sourced from the winery's estate vineyard in the new Fort Ross-Seaview appellation. This underwent barrel fermentation, malolactic fermentation and lees aging, and the result is a rich selection that offers flavors of lemon and tropical fruit, buttered toast and cream. Almost too assertive now, it needs a year or two to resolve.",US
4330,US,"While this Chardonnay has rich tropical fruit and citrus flavors, with a light touch of oak, the acidity and minerality make it taste clean and balanced. Don't drink it too cold, and be sure to enjoy it with Dungeness crab and buttered sourdough bread.",US

4335,US,"Another beautiful Chardonnay from this fine vineyard and winery. The wine is drier than past vintages, but rich in acidity and minerals, with a complex array of pineapple, lime and Meyer lemon citrus flavor. Fermenting half the wine in stainless steel and the balance in oak, a third of which was new, seems to be the perfect approach.",US
4336,US,"Just delicious. Superrich in pineapple, white peach and sweet lemon pie fruit, with crème brûlée and buttered toast complexities, its opulence is balanced by crisp acidity. The finish turns unexpectedly dry and clean. Very fine, a wonderfully grown wine from this great vineyard.",US
4337,US,"A big, oaky Chardonnay, obviously rich and dense, but somewhat immature. Just doesn't feel like all the parts are working in harmony quite yet. Yet there's lots going on under the dryness, lees and wood tannins. Huge flavors of citrus and tropical fruits, minerals and flowers. Flashy, a crowd-pleaser. Give it 2–3 years in a cool cellar.",US
4338,US,"This has lots of ripe orange, lime, apricot and tropical fruit flavors, as well as hints of buttered toast and vanilla from oak aging. It's made in the simple but appealing popular style.",US
4339,US,"Quite soft and open, this easy-drinking Chardonnay tastes like vanilla cookie and lemon custard. It's easy to like, though it feels more like a snack than a wine to drink with dinner.",US
4340,US,"This is a simple, thin Chardonnay. It shows proper dryness, with a creamy texture and some decent pineapple and peach flavors.",US
4341,US,"This is lightly oaked, with pleasant Chardonnay flavors of oranges, limes and mangoes. However, it's too sweet, with a sugary finish that makes it cloying.",US
4342,US,"This is very acidic, like a taste of sour lemon. The flavors are of lemon cough drops, and the finish is dry.",US
4343,US,"This Chardonnay has ripe, rich tangerine, pear and pineapple flavors. It wasn't aged in oak, and the malolactic fermentation was blocked. The result is a clean, vibrant and mouthwatering selection.",US
4344,US,"This tastes bone dry, with cleansing acidity and firm minerality. It offers subtle layers of green apples, figs and tropical fruits, plus an edge of sweet vanilla.",US
4345,US,"The inclusion of 11% Aligoté, which was sourced from a block planted in 1979, makes this Chardonnay unique. The Aligoté seems to thicken the core fruit, and it adds flesh and rind-like flavor, along with old-vine details of dried herb and spice. It's a pleasing mix of integrated stone-fruit, grain and citrus-peel notes.",US

4354,US,"There's some barrel influence in this Chardonnay, but the oak is way in the background. What stars is Edna Valley fruit, pure and refined and textbook varietal.

4364,US,"Hanzell says this Sebella Chardonnay is meant to drink now, while their regular Chardonnay, which is famously ageable, develops in the cellar.

The wine is fresh and fragrant, with brisk acidity giving a bracing feel to the citrus, nectarine and pear flavors. There's a minerality that adds structural integrity to the richness.",US
4479,US,"Chards from this vineyard always show a typicity of intensely ripe citrus and tropical fruits, backed with bracing acidity and a stony minerality. This bottling threatens to go over the top in apricot sorbet that may have a touch of botrytis, but it wisely pulls back into balance at the last moment. Will gradually lose fruit over the next 10 years, becoming nuttier and drier.",US
4480,US,"Bone dry and high in acidity, an austere and elegant Chardonnay that offers complex interest to those who can recognize it. Shows a mineral and steel profile, with lemon and lime fruit. Let it warm up in the glass.",France
4481,US,"Although there's a lot of oak on this wine, it's not heavy or fat in the excessive California style, because the underlying wine is so crisp and elegant. Call it Chablisian. It shows mineral, Meyer lemon and lime flavors, with brilliant acidity. Really quite a fine Carneros Chardonnay.",US
4482,US,"Fruity and oaky, with pineapple, mango, tangerine, vanilla and buttered toast flavors. Shows lots of the same characteristics of far more expensive Chardonnays, which makes it a good buy.",US
4483,US,"Lots of sweet, smoky oak on this wine, with flavors of pineapples, peaches, limes, vanilla and honey. It's balanced with crisp acidity. Drink now.",US
4484,US,"A California Chardonnay for Montrachet fans, this is the color of Golden Delicious apple, and it fully shows its time spent in barrel. Rich and unctuous, this is a heady wine, with lingering tastes of butterscotch, crème brûlée and vanilla, that is still laced with minerality. It is extremely well made, fitting for special occasions.",US
4485,US,"Another success for Talley from this vineyard, especially given the challenges of the chilly vintage. It shows ripe tropical fruit, spice and vanilla flavors, with a creamy texture. At its best now, it will pair nicely with lobsters, scallops or crabs.",US
4486,US,"Dry, simple and earthy, with modest peach, citrus, vanilla and honey flavors. Okay as an everyday sipper.",US
4487,US,"This shows the balanced richness and price sensitivity that Lake Sonoma usually displays. It has the delicious apricot and tangerine fruits and oak quality of more expensive wines, without quite the depth or complexity.",US
4488,US,"This unoaked Chardonnay offers great complexity at an affordable everyday price. It's dry and elegantly balanced with crisp acids. Rich flavors of pineapples, Meyer lemons, limes and vanilla  hardly need wood for richness.",US
4489,US,"Shows the very dry herbal, floral and tobacco flavors that often mark Napa Chardonnays (and the vineyard is on the Napa side of Carneros). But there's a good core of tropical citrus fruits, while oak adds needed richness of smoky vanilla and buttered toast. Drink now.",US
4490,US,"Barrel fermented, soft and ripe with bright fruits, especially banana, but also pear, apricot, peach and citrus. Rich and creamy, it combines sweet barrel toast with a hint of honey. Lush through the finish, which adds caramel and cinnamon toast.",France

4494,US,"Great price for a Chardonnay this rich and attactive.Although the alcohol is relatively high, the wine feels balanced, with a proper tension between ripe fruit, oak, alcohol, lees and acidity. Offers savory flavors of lemondrop candy, pineapple tart and buttered toast.",US
4495,US,"Run, don't walk to buy up cases of this beautiful, well-priced Chardonnay. It's rich and sumptuous in vanilla oak and lees-inspired flavors of pineapples, pears and lime tart. Easy to find, with production of 17,496 cases.",US

4497,US,"A flamboyant, crisp Chardonnay made in the popular style of elaborately toasty oak and very ripe fruit, which combine to offer an almost pastry-like dessert taste.

4500,US,"A very good, delicious Chardonnay that's easy to drink, and whose richness suggests shrimp, scallops, lobster and similarly rich fare. Dry and crisp in acidity, it wows with pineapple marmalade, crème brûlée, buttered toast, vanilla, honeysuckle and mineral flavors, brightened with zesty acidity.",US
4501,US,"Powerful scents of toast and buttered popcorn dominate the nose, but once in the mouth the wine shows some grip and depth. For those who love the buttery style of Chardonnay, this will be hard to beat at this price. Traces of apple and pear fruit show in the midpalate, and the wine lingers gracefully into a full-bodied finish.",US
4502,US,"Shows the weight, complexity and sheer deliciousness that this bottling almost always displays. Chardonnay fans will love the oaky, creamy flavors of pineapple tart, pear and lemon jam and buttered toast. The winemaker recommends pairing with black cod, and if you have a Chinese restaurant that makes a good version of this honey and soy inspired dish, it will be heaven.",US
4503,US,"This is a lovely Chardonnay, a super restaurant wine list bottle. Dry and creamy, it offers pleasantly rich pineapple, lime pie, green apple, exotic spice and buttered toast flavors, accented with crisp, clean acidity.",US
4504,US,"This exudes classic Chardonnay richness. Pure and heady, it explodes with tropical fruit and orange essences, with buttered toast and vanilla flavors from oak barrels and lees contact.

4505,US,"Extravagantly rich in tropical fruit, orange, honey and sweet oak flavors, this is balanced, with crisp acidity and a dry finish. It's a good example of the popular style, at the upper tier.",US
4506,US,"Rich and fruity, with tons of pineapple, mango, lime, peach, pear, nectarine and honey flavors. Lots of sweet smoky oak, too. Not particularly complex, but flashy. Drink now.",US
4507,US,"Lots of ripe pineapple, Asian pear and sweet orange cream flavors in this wine, but the oak is too dominant and the balancing acidity is insufficient, making the finish sweetly flabby.",US
4508,US,"Strong in oaky flavors, with sweet, sugary caramel dominating everything underneath. The basic wine seems pretty good, showing pineapples and acidity.",US
4509,US,"Sweet as a dessert, with vanilla, buttercream, brown-sugared pastry crust and pineapple custard flavors. Lots of people like this style, but it's kind of simple.",US
4510,US,"Unoaked, with pineapple, vanilla and spice flavors and some sweet cream from sur lie aging. But loses points for some green pyrazine smells and tastes.",US

4512,US,"Shows nice pineapple tart, lemondrop, buttered toast and vanilla oak flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Finishes quick and could be more concentrated, but it's a very good, elegant Chardonnay at a fair price.",US

4516,US,"The vintage was particularly successful for Patz & Hall, which achieved ripeness and balancing acidity with a seemingly effortless touch. This wine is brilliantly clean and extraordinarily rich in pineapples, Meyer lemons, sweet limes and minerals. Grows better as it warms in the glass.",US
4517,US,"Morgan makes one of the best, most powerful Santa Lucia Chardonnays, and this less expensive bottling is a good approximation of their top tier. It's strong and potent, with cool-climate acidity framing mouthwatering pineapple jam, Key lime pie, kiwi fruit, white peach and vanilla cream flavors.",US
4518,US,"Very rich, reflecting 100% barrel fermentation in partial new oak and 100% malolactic fermentation. Under the creamy lees and buttered toast are scads of pineapples, pears and papayas. The grapes come from the Nielson Vineyard.",US
4519,US,"This is a strong, oaky, ripe Chardonnay, grown on a mountain better known for Cabernet. It's powerful and intense in pineapple tart, pear marmalade, Meyer lemon and lime flavors that have been liberally oaked, and it shows the creamy influence of lees. Not particularly subtle, it's a wine you don't want to drink too cold.",US
4520,US,"With no oak, there's nothing here but natural grape flavors of oranges, limes, green apples, pears and golden mangoes. The acidity is high and racy. Ready now, but don't drink it too cold.",US
4521,US,"This valley in Santa Barbara County continues to prove its relevance to California Chardonnay, as proven once again by this dry, crisply elegant and decadently delicious wine. It bursts in the mouth with juicy pineapple, white peach and honeysuckle flavors, generously oaked, but is balanced in acidity and minerals.",US
4522,US,"Drier and more minerally than Foxen's other Chardonnays, because it is the least oaked. It's vibrant in grilled pineapple, mango, apricot and vanilla spice flavors, brightened by beautiful acidity. Alcohol is quite high, but the wine never tastes hot or unbalanced.",US
4523,US,"Every intervention available to the winemaker for creating richness has been applied here, including 75% new French oak. California Chardonnay hardly gets more extravagant in buttercream, smoky toast, lemon drop, apple butter and pear flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Grown in one of the coolest areas of the appellation, yet it's so rich and full bodied, it almost has the body of a red wine. Don't let it get too cold, and pay attention as it warms and evolves in the glass.",US
4524,US,"A rich, oaky Chardonnay, overwhelming in buttered toast, caramel, pineapple jam, crème brûlée and cinnamon spice flavors. If you're looking for a big, strong Chardonnnay, it's for you.",US
4525,US,"Superripe and oaky, with caramelized, sweet vanilla cookie and buttered popcorn flavors dominating the pineapple jam. Clumsy.",US
4526,US,"Oaky and simple, with flavors of peaches, buttered toast and cream. Turns vegetal in the finish.",US

4528,US,"Production of this Chardonnay was cut way back in 2010, but the quality is as good as ever. It's an elegant wine, showcasing purity of fruit. Flavors of meyer lemon, citrus, orange peel and pretty apple abound. There is both balance and depth to the finish.",US

4531,US,"Just 183 cases were made of this wine, which has firm stone fruits and a more-than-generous amount of toast and butter. If you like your Chardonnays on the extra oaky side, this is for you.",US
4532,US,"Drinking this new Ponzi reserve right after it's been released is not optimal; the supple and substantial fruit needs more time to meld with the barrel flavors. Once the bananas and peaches, the crème brûlée and vanilla custard flavors all combine, this will be anchored in hedonistic, lip-smacking, give-me-another-glass country.",US
4533,US,"Soft and honeyed, an unctuous Chardonnay with pleasant citrus fruit and buttered toast flavors. Finishes a bit quick, but earns kudos for dryness and a clean, spicy finish. Easy to find, with more than 50,000 cases produced.",US
4534,US,"This is a very pure, fresh and clean Chardonnay. While it's rich in tropical fruit, pear, green apple and smoky oak flavors, it's also well balanced. Shows brisk, citrusy acidity and a firm stream of minerals.",US
4535,US,"Chappellet's secret is that Cabernet Sauvignon isn't the only thing they know how to do. Granted, their Chards have off years, but in general they make one of the valley's best Chardonnays. The 2008 is right up there with the '04 and '07. Ripe in pineapples, peaches and pears, it avoids the herbaceousness that can mar Napa Chardonnay. Very fine.",US
4536,US,"A pure, clean Chardonnay whose dry richness is balanced with cool-climate acidity and a citrus streak almost like Sauvignon Blanc. Shows pineapple and pear flavors that indicate the varietal, but then crisp, tartly acidic lemongrass and grapefruits kick in. The result is wonderfully food-friendly. Easy to find, with 10,600 cases produced.",US
4537,US,"A beautiful Chardonnay that shows ripe, long hangtime fruit flavors of pineapples, apricots, peaches and papayas, offset with clean acidity. Shows a touch of oak. Will satisfy Chard fans, and is super food-friendly with grilled salmon, shrimp, scallops.",US
4538,US,"A very good Chardonnay that displays admirable dryness and firmness of structure, with good fruit. Feels clean in the mouth, with a taste of cold steel that undergirds pineapple and buttered toast flavors.",US
4539,US,"Young, vibrant and fresh, this wine's crisp acidity frames pineapple and tropical fruit flavors, with a slight hint of botrytis in the form of golden apricot and honey. There's lots of evident oak, creating a buttered toast note, while its minerality makes it complex. Vastly rich, if a little lacking in subtlety. Drink now.",US
4540,US,"This is firm in acidity, bracing in minerals and bone dry. That makes it sound austere, but you'll find delicious apricot, lime and citron flavors, enhanced by sweet oak. Drink now.",US
4541,US,"Total California style here, a rich, sweet, honeyed Chardonnay marked by tiers of pineapples, mangos, pears and limes. It's all flash and dazzle for drinking now.",US
4542,US,"With great dryness, minerality and acidity, this marches to a different beat from today's rich, oaky style. It's austere, with suggestions of citrus fruit and flint. It exhibits great structure and complexity.",US
4543,US,"Sharp and spicy, this is a high-acid, stainless-steel-fermented wine, with a green berry note and a hint of melon.",US
4544,US,"Dry, brisk in acidity and ripe, this has stimulating minerality that undergirds the fruit flavors of Meyer lemon, lime and guava. But what dominates is the hugeness of size and the richness that goes on and on.",France
4545,US,"Dry and creamy, with peaches and cream, buttered toast and mineral flavors. The oak sticks out a little too much, and there's some bitterness that rich fare will help balance.",US
4546,US,"Crisp, delicate and clean Chardonnay, with zesty citrus acidity, like a squeeze of lime. Tastes savory, with lime, white flower and mineral flavors. A likeable young wine that's a good pairing with shellfish.",US
4547,US,"There is a lively, stony zip to this tank-fermented Chardonnay that lifts the palate and invites sipping. The flavors are pleasantly herbal, with strands of celery, cilantro, melon and green banana weaving together across the palate and into a crisp finish.",US
4548,US,"With buttered popcorn scents and flavors, underscored with pretty, toasty oak, this marries those flavors to a more restrained body, balanced with good acidity and showing fruit flavors of green apple and banana cream pie. Not a complex wine, but forward and flavorful.",US
4549,US,"Shows some of the richness and complexity of Migration's single-vineyard Chardonnays, but at much less money. The wine is dry, crisp and flavorful in pineapples, green apples, limes and honeysuckle, with oaky notes of buttered toast. Drink now.",US
4550,US,"This is pure Chardonnay, from cool-climate sites, showing a lean, sculpted spine that both defines and expands the flavors. Exceptionally complex for Washington Chardonnay, with good natural acidity, a mix of peach, apple and pineapple fruit, and a finish that shows tight layering. There is a dense core that should unravel with bottle age; this is that rare Washington Chardonnay that will prosper with cellaring.",US
4551,US,"Made in the modern, ripe style, but with a greater degree of finesse than you might expect at this price. The wine is dry and crisp and minerally, with a clean mouthfeel, yet offers rich flavors of pineapples, green apples and peaches. Easy to find, with more than 12,000 cases produced.",US
4552,US,"Smells bright, citrusy and clean, an impression followed in the mouth, where intricate flavors of pineapple, lemondrop candy and Key lime pie turn spicy on the finish. The acidity is brisk; the wine did not go through malolactic fermentation. Just shows that a great Chardonnay doesn't need oak, although sur lies aging gives it a notable creaminess.",US
4553,US,"Organically grown estate grapes lend credence to the reserve designation. This is a generous wine, deftly matching its pineapple, citrus and peach flavors to sweet oak. Still young, so decant it or give it another year or two of bottle age.",US
4554,US,"This is a big, rich Chardonnay even though it never saw a splinter of oak. It's tremendous in pear, green apple and vanilla flavors. A nice price for a flashy, everyday Chard.",US
4555,US,"Chardonnays from this vineyard always are powerful, but this bottling is over the top. It has ultraripe apricot and tangerine flavors, with strong acidity. Seems almost botrytised, with a honeyed intensity, although it's dry.",US
4556,US,"Unoaked and quite dry, this young Chardonnay will show best accompanied by soft cheeses or light seafood. Light and juicy, with sharp green apple fruit flavors.",US
4557,US,"Good and rich, but tastes too oaky, with the pineapple, nectarine and peach flavors swamped by vanilla, caramel and butterscotch. Other than that, there's a fine, crisp minerality to the finish.",US
4558,US,"Made in the popular style of oak-enhanced ripe fruit, this Chard shows flavors of pineapples, peaches and cream, buttered toast, buttered popcorn and cinnamon spice. It finishes a little sweet and simple.",US
4559,US,"Soft and fruity, with a balanced mix of tropical fruit flavors—banana and pineapple—and juicy caramel, this appealing Chardonnay is drinking perfectly. There is just enough green apple tang to the finish to keep it fresh and focused through the finish.",US

4562,US,"Good price for such a nice Chardonnay from the Santa Rita Hills. The wine is very dry and crisp in acidity, with a bracing mouthfeel that offers rich, oak-inspired flavors of pineapples, pears and green apples. Nice now with Ahi tuna tartare or grilled salmon.",US
4563,US,"Drier and earthier than many other Chardonnays, this one is easy to drink and food friendly. It shows oak-inspired flavors of pineapples and vanilla, with a creamy, leesy texture. Nice with poached salmon with roasted new potatoes on a summer evening.",US
4564,US,"From the original Kiona vineyard planting in 1975, this big, lush Chardonnay fills the palate with ripe banana and stone fruit flavors. It was barrel fermented, then moved to stainless, and put through partial malolactic. Good definition, acidity, and a hint of minerality.",US
4565,US,"Pressed directly to barrel prior to fermentation, it's dusty and fragrant, capturing the higher acidity of the vintage, and some underlying minerality. This 2008 does not have the ripe peachiness of the previous year, but the citrus/pineapple fruit makes an excellent food wine, stylish and affordable.",US
4566,US,"The fruity flavors of pineapples, mangoes and papayas burst from this wine, with a rich layer of smoky, caramelized oak. Almost as sweet as a dessert pastry, it's made to appeal to the popular Chardonnay palate.",US
4567,US,"With a taste of white sugar and honey, this Chardonnay can't really be described as dry. But it is clean and vibrant in acidity, with rich pineapple jam and green apple flavors, and the underlying tang of minerals helps to ground it.",US
4568,US,"Tastes pretty sweet, with a sugar and honeysuckle richness. But the tangerine fruit flavor is deep and impressive, and the vanilla and buttered toast notes from oak are what consumers like.",US
4569,US,"This is a juicy, buttery, nicely defined bottle with caramel and butterscotch flavors that run through its heart. Thoroughly delicious fruit notes of key lime and apple pie complete the picture.",US

4572,US,"This is too oaky, with vanilla, buttered toast and butterscotch notes dominating the underlying pineapple and guava flavors.",US
4573,US,"A really nice, elegant Chardonnay at a good price. The wine is dry and lightly oaked, showing rich pineapple, peach, vanilla and buttered toast flavors enhanced with crisp acidity. Only 731 cases were produced of this lovely, food-friendly wine.",US
4574,US,"This is tight when first opened, with a hard-edged herbal character. Beneath that shell are richer, tropical fruit flavors of ripe banana, yellow apple and a hint of papaya; and with plenty of breathing time the wine softens and opens out. Roughly two thirds of the barrels were new French oak; and that is still being resolved into the fruit. This wine has a good 6–8 years of life ahead of it, but if you are drinking it now, decant it.",US
4575,US,"Super-fruity in pineapples, peaches and sweet vanilla oak, with adequate acidity, this is a rich, forward Chardonnay to drink now with shellfish or mushroom risotto.",US
4576,US,"Great price for a Chardonnay that tastes like it costs a lot more. Although it's unoaked, it's very rich in passionfruit, pineapple, peach and vanilla cream flavors, with a honeyed finish. Easy to find, with 5,000 cases produced.",US
4577,US,"A difficult vintage for the winery, and not the most successful Robert Young Chardonnay. But it does show the elegance of the vineyard. Rich in acids and oak, its underlying flavors are of oranges and pineapples. Drink now, not too cold.",US
4578,US,"This wine really flaunts its stuff (and its oak aging) in its rich, creamy body and intensely luscious profile. Aromas and flavors of buttered brioche, baked apples, butter and light smoky spice fill out the nose and mouth, with notes of sweet vanilla-infused spice lingering throughout the long finish. Oaky, sure, but well balanced and delicious, too.",US
4579,US,"A really good Chardonnay that shows the classic acidity and dryness of the Sonoma Coast, with complex, pleasurable flavors. Pineapples, pears, apricots and guavas are the fruits, enriched with sweet oak, in a dry, balanced and elegant wine that could develop bottle nuance over the next 2–4 years.",US
4580,US,"This is one of the drier, steelier Chardonnays on the market. It shows flavors of Meyer lemons, limes and tart white peaches, with a tantalizing acidity that makes the mouth water. Trades opulence for elegance, a nice wine for roasted salmon and sweet summer corn.",US
4581,US,"This shows the impressive acidity and spice flavor that this cool part of Santa Barbara County coaxes out of its wines. With a touch of new oak, it provides balanced flavors of pineapple, lime, green apple, buttered toast, vanilla, crème brûlée and honeysuckle.",US
4582,US,"This shows an evident layer of oak in the form of buttered toast and vanilla notes, but the underlying wine is strong in pineapple and golden mango flavors. Fine coastal acidity and a hint of mineral provide structural balance.",US
4583,US,"Could be a cool-climate Sauvignon Blanc, with its gooseberry, citrus and pyrazine aromas and flavors and the sour mouthfeel.",US
4584,US,"Chardonnay doesn't get much better than this. Bursts with grilled pineapple-infused crème brûlée, peach pie, butter-sautéed banana, passion fruit and butterscotch flavors, dusted with cinnamon and brown sugar. Yet all that opulence is balanced by perfect acidity. Totally gorgeous.",US
4585,US,"This is a lovely combination of stone fruit and grapefruit flavors, with a creaminess that makes the wine very inviting. Pleasing and balanced, this shows minerality and a tinge of vanilla on the finish. Pair it with fish or light meats off the grill.",US
4586,US,"This estate grown, organic Chardonnay has plenty of acidity, but the tart lemon-lime and green-apple fruit is leavened with crisp minerality. The mouthfeel, texture and length elevate this to levels beyond just a simple, citrusy Chardonnay.",France
4587,US,"Crisp and refreshing, this is attractive with notes of fresh lemon, lime and pear from cooler-climate vineyards. It's like a breath of fresh air, and it should pair beautifully with a wide range of meals.",US
4588,US,"A very rich wine, courtesy of some Viognier and Pinot Gris, not to mention new oak. Offers flattering flavors of pineapples, golden mangoes, vanilla cream, buttered toast and honeysuckle flowers.",US
4589,US,"From estate fruit, this Chardonnay falls a bit flat in the mouth. The fruit is light and simple, and there is a hint of bitterness that leave a chemical aftertaste.",US
4590,US,"A bit quick on the finish, but otherwise a nice everyday Chardonnay. Shows a soft, buttercream texture, with dry, subtle flavors of pineapples, pears and buttered toast.",US
4591,US,"A classy Chardonnay for sipping now. Dry and zesty in acidity, it has appealing tangerine, Meyer lemon, white flower, honey and mineral flavors.",US

4594,US,"Shows the brisk, tart acidity that always shows up in wines from this little Central Coast appellation. Also demonstrates the bright flavors of limes, kiwis and pineapples that mark an Edna Valley Chardonnay. Not subtle, but deliciously drinkable.",US
4595,US,"Very dry, crisp and minerally, a subtle wine with some bottle age that shows real complexity and finesse. Not for fruit-forward fans, its pineapple, pear and herb flavors are drying out, leading to interesting, old-wine, honey-and-cashew nuances. Drink right away, before it dies.",US
4596,US,"Made in the stylish cult manner of exceptionally ripe pineapple, kiwi and pear fruit flavors, lavishly oaked, this Chard will please fans of the style. One wishes it were more sophisticated and complex, but lots of people will ooh and aah over its sheer power.",US
4597,US,"Shows rich, forward pineapple tart and crème brûlée flavors that are satisfying and dry. Delicious and spicy, although it's just a bit sharp. Drink now.",US
4598,US,"Sweet tangerine, tropical fruit and honey flavors mark this Chardonnay. It was wise on the winemaker's part to avoid the malolactic fermentation, because the fresh apple acidity livens up the richness. With a touch of buttered toast from new oak barrels, it's a savory wine to drink now.",US
4599,US,"There are lots of rich, ripe vanilla, buttered toast and tropical fruit flavors in this creamy wine. Brightened with acidity, it will appeal to plenty of Chardonnay fans.",US

4605,US,"This is barrel fermented, and it's for the consumer who loves the oakier style of Chardonnay. This excellent vineyard has the fruit concentration and acidity to stand up to the barrel flavors.",US
4606,US,"This is oily and ripe, with plenty of butter, butterscotch and toasty new oak. What elevates it, as with all Pacific Northwest Chardonnays, is the extra acidity, that provides a foundation of support under the lush fruit and generous new oak. It might smooth out a bit over the next couple of years, but it's a wine built to be savored sooner rather than later.",US
4607,US,"The chilly vintage has produced a very dry, young wine whose flavors veer toward acid-inspired mineral, citrus peel and apricots, rather than the riper flavors of a warmer year, such as 2008.

4631,US,"Dry, tart and citrusy. Offers streamlined flavors of lemons, limes, tannic herb tea and minerals, with oak and lees adding much-needed richness. It's elegant in a Chablisian way, but trades fruity opulence for a more complex, connoisseur's austerity. Drink now, and don't over-chill.",US

4643,US,"Quite good, but some vegetal flavors mar this dessert wine, which is very sweet, with 18% residual sugar. Such sweetness is usually enough to satisfy on its own, but despite the apricot, tangerine and vanilla flavors, a stubborn green streak lowers the score.",US

4652,US,"There's not much going on here beyond lots of smoky, caramelized oak and some easy peach and citrus flavors. A touch of unripeness is also found. Chardonnnay has not been ZD's strong suit, and still isn't.",US

4662,US,"So fresh and inviting with aromas of apple cider, pear slices and pineapple core. More of the same unfolds in the mouth with soft accents of smoke appearing on the end of the finish. Balanced with medium weight and acidity; an excellent option for outdoor grilling, at an attractive price.",US
4663,US,"Underlying the tart fruit flavors of crisp apple and cucumber are spicy, peppery highlights. At the moment, the new oak barrel flavors often found are not evident, but wines go through interesting morphs along the aging curve. This one is just starting to soften up. Organically grown and limited to just 107 cases.",US
4664,US,"This has the sort of tart, lemon custard flavor you might find in a French pastry. It's snappy and fresh, the fruit amplified with toasty oak scents and accents. Still young and raw, it will profit from decanting and/or a couple more years in bottle.",US
4665,US,"From Dijon clones, this sculpted, tight, compact Chardonnay feels as if it is shut in a cocoon. Give it time (and decanting) to unwrap, and it shows elegant tropical and stone fruits, caramel, vanilla cream and butter flavors, backed with moderate acids.",US

Flavors revolve around apple, Asian pear and melon, with finishing hints of buttered popcorn.",US

4672,US,"Shows the creamy texture of Chardonnay, with the sweet-and-sour pineapple flavor of a Chinese food sauce.",US
4673,US,"Tough in acidity, with less than ripe tobacco and herb flavors, this bone-dry Chardonnay isn't offering much richness.",US
4674,US,Way too oaky. The underlying fruit is not nearly strong enough to support all that caramel and buttered toast. The result is clumsy.,US

4676,US,"In only the winery's second vintage, this Chard offers a balanced experience with notes of ripe red apple, pear and pineapple core playing harmoniously alongside soft toast and vanilla flavors. The full, creamy texture is stopped from being too much by moderate acidity and a clean finish.",US

4683,US,"All the oaky, leesy richness is there, with buttered toast, crème brûlée and smoky buttercream, and tons of fruity ripeness, with a blast of Meyer lemon, pineapple, white peach and apricot. Yet there's also a firm, steely minerality, and, despite the dryness, maybe even a delicious touch of botrytis. The acidity is mouthwatering.",US
4684,US,"A massively constructed Chardonnay that's opulent and concentrated and bursts in the mouth with pineapple, lemon drop candy, Asian pear and white peach flavors of enormous ripeness. The entire production of 108 cases was aged in new oak, so there's a lavish veneer of sweet, smoky buttered toast. Sur lie aging is evident in the creaminess and ever so slight sourdough tartness that adds a piquant touch. This impressive Chard is at its best now in its flashy, flamboyant youth.",US
4685,US,"A négociant wine, sharp and spicy, with vivid acidity and some real punch in the midpalate. The flavors suggest thistle and fern – real Northwest fare – rather than riper fruit. It sets up well in the mouth and despite alcohol listed at just 12.5%, has good presence and power.",US
4686,US,"As the name suggests, this wine comes from a variety of different types of barrels and toast levels. It comes across as very oaky and buttery-popcorny, with a creamy texture housing pineapple marmalade flavors.",US

4691,US,"Showing sweet toasty oak, brisk acidity and pure flavors of citrus fruit and apricot, this is a very rich, dry Chardonnay, although all of its parts haven't quite come together. While it's not an ager, it will benefit from holding until mid-2013, but not any longer.",US

4695,US,"From the Evergreen Vineyard, in the Ancient Lakes region north of the Wahluke Slope, this is surprisingly high-powered, at 13.9% alcohol, with a big smack of oak in the nose. That oak is wrapped around green banana and green apple fruit, with a little vanilla on the side. As young as it is, it seems likely to knit together and improve over the next year or two.",US
4696,US,"Sweet oak and lightly tropical fruit flavors characterize this young, tight, full-bodied Chardonnay. With another year or two in bottle, the fruit should emerge from behind the new oak flavors and enhance the overall balance. In the meanwhile, decanting is a good idea.",US
4697,US,"Superrich in vanilla cream, buttered toast, pineapple jam and tangerine sorbet flavors, with a honeyed finish. Is it dry or sweet? Seems both at the same time, accented with bright, Central Coast acidity. Drink now.",US

4700,US,"The underlying wine is very good, showing brisk acidity, a cool-climate minerality and long hangtime, ripe flavors of pineapples, crisp green apples, mangoes and limes. Yet the oak is heavy-handed, overwhelming the fruit with caramel, and making the finish too sweet.",US

It's strong and impressive now, and not particularly subtle, but should have a narrow window of near perfection. 2011–2013.",US

4724,US,"Previous vintages tasted more balanced than this super-oaky one. The wood erupts from the glass, suggestive of caramel, buttered popcorn, vanilla cream pie and charcoal, overwhelming what seems to be a perfectly nice wine. Some folks will love it.

4746,US,This single-vineyard Chard with no oak has a light bouquet with nuances of white florals and red apple. The palate offers more heft and concentration with flavors of peach preserves and clementine supremes. Lower alcohol with a medium-length finish; rich and tasty without being overdone.,US
4747,US,"A well-made wine with a creamy texture and long finish, infused with aromas and flavors of buttered toast, grilled peaches, apple skins and almond shells. Balanced and not over-oaked; an excellent choice for hearty chicken pasta dishes and bisques.",US
4748,US,"One quarter of this wine went through malolactic, and it retains a riveting acidity. Pineapple and citrus fruit is wrapped in rock. It's very young and tight, but along with sharp lime and citrus come fleshier stone fruit flavors and hints of melon and caramel. Give this plenty of breathing time, or decant it.",US
4749,US,"Superripe and oaky in pineapple, white peach purée, pear tart, buttered toast and vanilla-infused crème brûlée, this Chardonnay is saved from mere richness by crisp coastal acidity and a fine spine of minerals. Exotic and delicious, it's at its best now.",US
4750,US,"Even in a high acid vintage such as 2008, this is rich, almost oily, a full-throttle wine well-endowed with full-bodied fruit flavor. Though 50% new oak is used, the barrels are bigger (92 gallons instead of 55) which reduces the toastiness. A wine that will not disappoint fans of the John Abbott/Abeja style.",US
4751,US,"This is a dry, firmly crisp Chardonnay, with pineapple, apricot, mineral and vanilla flavors. It's somewhat simple and direct, but very clean and zesty. Nice for drinking now.",US
4752,US,"The winery mentions neutral oak barrels, though the immediate aromatic impression is still on the toasty/oaky side. The fruit comes up more slowly, along with residual CO2 that gives a spritzy mouthfeel. Yeasty, light and tart, with green apples the strongest fruit flavor.",US
4753,US,"Decadent and intense, this smells like breakfast toast that has been slathered with red currant jam, mango butter and apricot preserves, topped with a drizzle of honey. The mouthfeel is rich, round and unctuous, with a zing of acidity that keeps it from seeming cloying. Notes of brûléed sugar and spice decorate the finish.",US
4754,US,"This vineyard has been source to some of Fogarty's greatest Chardonnays, and this 2009 bottling continues the tradition of excellence. It's bone dry and tart in acidity, with smoky oak and lees influences. But the real star of the wine is the fruit; the flavors of lemon and lime custard, papaya, guava and nectarine are delicious.",US
4755,US,"This late-released bottling is incredibly interesting. Connoisseurs will appreciate the bone-dry minerality and acidity, the subtle creaminess from lees aging and the citrusy flavors that just begin to suggest tropical fruit. It should continue to develop in the bottle for a few more years.",US
4756,US,"This is powerful in tropical fruit, apricot and oak flavors, but balanced with acidity and a tangy, minerally taste of stones. Rich and evocative, it appeals to the senses while retaining a complex intellectual charm. Drink now with lobster or crab dishes, especially a rich, buttery risotto.",US
4757,US,"With rich, honeyed flavors of apricots and oranges, this flashy, dramatic Chardonnay seemingly tastes as sweet as a pastry, but the amazing thing is that it's actually dry. It's brisk in coastal acidity, with complex nuances of toasty oak and a creamy mouthfeel. For drinking now.",US
4758,US,"The closest thing in California you can get to a great French Chablis, this is absolutely dry, high in acidity and streamlined. It offers tantalizing citrus rind and peach fruit flavors, with a savory taste of cold minerals. Fans of rich, buttery Chardonnay will find it lean, but if you have a cellar, age it for six years and see how it evolves.",US
4759,US,"A nose of creamy toast and spice leads this round, smooth Chardonnay. Full and weighty on the palate with a pert, spicy spin, the wine is dependable and serious.",US
4760,US,"A nice Chardonnay that shows ripe pineapple, green apple and pear flavors, with added smoky richness from oak, and the finish is dry and crisp. A good price for a wine of this quality.",US
4761,US,"A bit common, with a scoury texture and decent flavors of pineapples, apples and oak, with a very dry, acidic finish.",US
4762,US,Quite big and decadent smelling as notes of caramel-drizzled apple pie with vanilla ice cream on top emanate from the glass. The mouth is full and milky with solid acidity supporting the rich flavors of toasted brioche and smoky apple. A solid choice for dishes that can match its intensity of flavors: think lobster newburg or crab thermidor.,US
4763,US,"Brisk acidity provides a bracing balance to the ripe pineapple, pear and peach jam flavors, and there's a nice streak of minerality. However, the wine is far too sweet, and is cloying in the sugary finish.",US
4764,US,"The winery doesn't tell us where in this gigantic, multi-county region the grapes came from, but it's quite a good wine. Firm in citrusy acids, with a mineral undertow, it's a dry, elegant wine with complex notes of pineapples, buttered toast and creamy lees. Lots of oak, but it's integrated with the fruit.",US
4765,US,"A full, fruity, slightly hot Chardonnay. The barrel aging—all French, 60% new—brings the expected toastiness. This is a solidly made, fruit-forward style, immediately ready for drinking.",US
4766,US,"Soft and simple, with canned apple and pear flavors and a heavy dose of sweet, charry oak.",US
4767,US,"Sweet in oak and simple, with jammy apricot, pineapple and gingerbread flavors.",US
4768,US,"This is a very ripe, fruity Chardonnay, and also a very oaky one. It tastes like apricot brûlée. It will satisfy fans of this California style, but is really fairly simple.",US
4769,US,"A new effort from Long Shadows, Dance spent 15 months in French oak and shows it. Broad and smoky, it's a rich, generous, ready-to-drink wine, with just a tiny bit of unoaked 2011 wine in the blend for added lift and freshness.",France
4770,US,"This Chardonnay emphasizes structural elegance and mineral-driven acidity, rather than opulence, although you'll find good citrus and tropical fruit flavors. With a dry finish, it's a fine Chardonnay to drink with chicken, ham, salmon or pork, or a nice dish of buttery pasta with peas and Parmesan.",US
4771,US,"A bit soft and melted, but offers exotically rich flavors of golden mango, pineapple and cinnamon spice, in a custardy texture.",US
4772,US,"Another terrific offering from Shafer, this is a wine that seems to do well regardless of the vintage. It always shows a firm minerality and slight herbaceousness, with tropical fruit flavors and a smoky coating of fine oak. It's a shade less opulent than the 2009, making this very elegant and refined, yet still rich and complex. Don't drink it too cold—airing brings out subtle nuances.",US
4773,US,"Unbelievably rich, this tastes pretty much as excellent as the winery's more expensive Chardonnays. It really dazzles with its complex flavors of tropical fruit, green apple, pear, buttered toast and honey. It's all brightened by terrific acidity and wrapped into a creamy texture.",US
4774,US,"Tremendous flavors of honey, pear and orange jam are enriched with an oaky vanilla note. It's wonderfully creamy and spicy, and while it seemingly tastes as sweet as a pastry, the finish is dry. Only 425 cases were produced.",US
4775,US,"Fruity and oaky, with rich flavors of pineapples, pears, buttercream, vanilla cookie and toasty meringue. Crisp acidity provides clean balance.",US
4776,US,"The nose is lively and jumpy with notes of tart gooseberry, Granny Smith apple, lemony citrus and a hint of fresh ginger. The mouth offers riper, more oaky flavors of toasted nuts and pear flesh that lead through to the finish. Well balanced and easy to drink; so approachable, an excellent choice for outdoor summer dining with company.",US
4777,US,"This Chard offers a delicate but intricate bouquet with aromas of apple, vanilla spice and tropical acidity. The palate shows more floral and ripe red apple flavors, with a moderate weight in the mouth and a balanced finish. A solidly made and easy-to-enjoy wine.",US
4778,US,"Straightforward, this Chard shows well-ripened flavors of pineapple jam, nectarines, peaches and vanilla. It finishes with caramelized, butterscotchy sweetness.",US
4779,US,"Even people who like lots of buttered toast and smoky vanilla in their Chards might find this one a little over the top. It's a good, rich wine, with lots of bright tropical fruit, but it would score higher if it were just a little less oaky.",US
4780,US,"Sweet and oaky, this Chard tastes like a vanilla and caramel cream soda, with alcohol and a squirt of pineapple essence. Defines the superripe, opulent style, without much complexity.",US
4781,US,"This Chard is soft and sweet, very ripe in jammy white and yellow fruit flavors, and has a smoky-oak coating. It's made in a style meant to appeal to consumers.",France
4782,US,"Sweet new oak and jammy tropical fruit co-star in this Chard, offering immediate gratification but little complexity or follow-through. Needs a defter, more sensitive hand, especially at this price.",US
4783,US,"This bottling needs a good vintage to succeed, which it got in 2007. It's dry and crisp, but very rich in tropical fruit, pear, mineral and smoky oak flavors. Easy to find, with 18,000 cases produced.",US
4784,US,"Pure Wente clone from 17-year-old vines, this is cropped down to barely a ton an acre. Flavors are of melon and pear, and the acids keep the wine fresh and lively. The same vineyard produces grapes for Daedalus and Bergström.",US
4785,US,"Delicious and crisp in acidity, this is dry despite its flavors of honey and ripe, jammy tropical fruit. How this wine achieves such a quality is magic, but the brisk acidity helps, as does its stony minerality. Ready to enjoy now.",US
4786,US,"Insanely rich, this explodes in the mouth with orange, pineapple, apricot, tropical fruit and sweet new-oak flavors. The richness is tempered with crisp acidity and a minerality that tastes like a lick of cold steel. This is a good price for a Santa Lucia Chardonnay this rich and appealing.",US
4787,US,"With a creamy mouthfeel and ripe flavors of tangerines, tropical fruits, honey and sweet oak, this is a flashy effort. It will appeal to fans of the variety, and rightfully so, delivering a dry complexity that lifts it way above the average.",US
4788,US,"Showing the richness of the vineyard, this delivers huge, flamboyant flavors of apricot and tangerine jam. While it's technically dry, there's a honeyed sweetness that suggests a touch of botrytis. It's a strong wine, unafraid to command a boldness that may not be for everyone. This is distinctly Californian in style, and as it loses fruit with age, it will develop nut and earthy notes.",US
4789,US,"Fogarty continues its streak of great, Chablis-style Chardonnays with this single-vineyard bottling. True afficionados will love the dryness, acidity and minerality, which give it such great structure. The severity is relieved by flavors of citrus zest and white peach, and the creamy sourdough richness imparted by lees aging. Try aging it for at least six years.",US
4790,US,"This bottling always strives to avoid a heavy hand and express more of a terroir-driven Chardonnay. This is bone dry, tart in mouthwatering acidity and complex in citrus, tropical fruit and herb flavors. It's not an opulent attention getter, but instead prefers to seduce through subtlety and nuance.",US
4791,US,"This was a wet and difficult vintage in much of Oregon, and the 12.3% alcohol listed for this light, green Chardonnay suggests that it simply didn't ripen. Bone-dry, with a touch of minerality, the tart green apple flavors, thin to begin with, seem to vanish in mid-swallow. There is no midpalate at all.",US
4792,US,"Good price for an everyday wine with real Chardonnay character. Shows ripe pineapple and pear flavors, enriched with sweet oak-like notes of smoke, caramel and butterscotch.",US
4793,US,A bright and fresh character gives this Chardonnay a versatile appeal. Aromas of citrus and spice lead into cheerful fruit flavors with a touch of crisp acid. A touch lean in nature but a good choice for seafood and spicy cuisine.,US
4794,US,"This unoaked Chard has a somewhat Chablilsienne quality to it, with a beautiful mineral-driven freshness supported by delicate aromas of white peach, green apple and lively orange citrus. Light and immensely refreshing, it's a perfect apértitif sipper to be enjoyed with cheese and crudité.",US
4795,US,"Nicely balanced with attractive aromas and flavors of ripe stone fruit, lightly charred red apple and limey citrus. The mouth is round and lush but not fat, with moderate acidity keeping the weight in check and leading the way through the medium-length finish. Great for company alongside goat cheese appetizers.",US
4796,US,"Sweeter smelling than the usual Chard, with peach preserves, lychee, pear and pink florals unfolding in the bouquet. The mouth offers more oak-driven balance, with notes of cedar plank and spiced pears filling the cream-textured mouth. Seals the deal with a lingering, toasty finish.",US
4797,US,"Oak sticks out on this Chardonnay, striking with buttered toast, vanilla and wood char notes that dominate the underlying wine, which has perfectly fine citrus and tropical fruit flavors.",US
4798,US,"Sweeter, more developed aromas of caramel, candied red apple, Boston baked beans and honeydew develop on the nose, while the mouth shows more typical Chard notes of baked apple and hazelnut butter. A touch round and flabby, but ends with a long, delicious, vanilla-kissed finish.",US
4799,US,"A gigantically flavored wine, massive in pineapple, guava and apricot flavors, liberally accented with 65% new French oak. Although it's dry, it may even have a touch of botrytis, to judge from the honeyed concentration. Defines a particular style, but it doesn't seem to have a future, so drink up.",US
4800,US,"Here's a rich Chardonnay notable for plenty of fruit, and also for brisk acidity. It's creamy smooth, with pineapple, Meyer lemon and lime flavors that are almost sweet in the finish, but pull back in favor of minerality.",US
4801,US,"Clean, fresh and simple, this does not claim to be “unoaked” but it carries that style in its flavors, a snappy mix of green apple, pineapple and grapefruit. Good everyday drinking.",US
4802,US,"Simple and sweet, a New World Chardonnay with pineapple, orange cream and vanilla flavors. Crisp acidity provides fortunate cover for the richness.",US
4803,US,"A wonderful follow-up to the debut vintage, this generous Chardonnay brings green apples, stone fruits and suggestions of pineapple, with a judicious use of new oak that refrains from becoming more than a pleasing nuance. Excellent balance, with a firm, lingering finish that brings in butterscotch and ripe, sweet lemon.",US
4804,US,"A lightly tawny straw color, this is scented with grass and hay and smoked meat—unusual for a Chardonnay. Light apple-flavored fruit carries that same, strong smoked meat (and slightly plastic) streak of flavor—unmissable and quite persistent.",US
4805,US,"A solid, direct Chardonnay. Doesn't offer a whole lot of complexity, but it's dry and creamy, with spicy, oak-inspired pineapple and green apple flavors.",US
4806,US,"Pretty severe, an acidic, raspingly dry wine and even a tannic one. Shows an astringency rare in Chardonnay, even though there are some good pineapple and buttered toast flavors. Not an ager.",US
4807,US,"Released at the age of nearly four years, this wine tastes a little sweet and tired, like melted apricot jam sprinkled with vanilla and cinnamon, with dried fruit and herbal notes. Drink now before it goes further downhill.",US
4808,US,"Aromatic of sweet cream, ripe apple and buttered popcorn, this luxurious Chardonnay counters richness of flavor with brisk acidity and impeccably balanced alcohol. It's irresistibly luscious but elegant.",US
4809,US,"A bit on the soft side, but very delicious, with melted butter, ripe pineapple, lemondrop and cinnamon spice flavors that finish long and dry.",US
4810,US,"Pessagno's Chardonnays are always big and strong wines, as befits their growing conditions in the cool foothills of the coastal Monterey mountains. This is monumental in fruit, bursting at the seams with ripe apricots and tangerines, sweetened with honey, yet finishing dry. It's a wine to pair with elaborate fare.",US
4811,US,"Some will find this Chardonnay severe and lacking in richness as it's marked by dryness, minerality and acidity, rather than tropical fruit and sweet oak.It would not be surprising if this wine made gains in 5–6 years, but even if it doesn't, it defines a more elegant style.",US
4812,US,"Dainty and nuanced with notes of honeydew melon and red apple skin in the bouquet followed by flavors of stone fruit and peach. Moderate weight and acidity, with vibrant citrus carrying the refreshing finish.",US
4813,US,"With 12 months in French oak, the Reserve Barrel Fermented Chardonnay is a rounder, more spice-infused Chard than Macari's regular Estate Bottled offering. As big as it is, the nose is somewhat muted with soft notes of pear and yellow flowers and the palate shows more as a result of the oak (spice, toast) than the fruit.",US
4814,US,"A good wine, comprised of fruit from vineyards scattered across Santa Barbara County. It's bone dry and crisp in acidity, and also pretty oaky. The underlying fruit flavors are of apricots and pears, with perhaps a touch of botrytis. Ready to drink now.",US
4815,US,"Tasted in August, this Chard was tart, almost fizzy in acidity, not unpleasant in itself, but unusual. It gave a bubbly note to the peach, pear and pineapple flavors. Drink now.",US
4816,US,"This is a vibrant, energetic Chardonnay that starts with fresh aromas of lemon zest, vanilla and spice and follows with appealing flavors of lemon, spice and citrus. Food- friendly and versatile.",US
4817,US,"Pretty good price for what you get. Shows everyday flavors of pears, pineapples and peaches, with a touch of nutmeg and cinnamon. Best Buy.",US
4818,US,"This is an easy, approachable Chardonnay with toast, peppery aromas and a pretty balance of vanilla, toast and spice. It's a soft style of wine that will pair well with cheeses, poultry dishes and salads.",US
4819,US,"Pretty good, with ripe pineapple flavors brightened with crisp acidity. But the oak is too strong, coating the fruit with a heavy plaster of butterscotch and smoky caramel.",US
4820,US,"One of the leanest, most severe Chardonnays out there. In its favor is extreme dryness, elegance and a refreshing minerality. But the citrus flavors are so thin, there's just not much going on, and a little oak doesn't help. Simply lacks richness.",US
4821,US,"This wine in a box is made using a faucet technology just like your sink, which feels weird, but it's easy to use and keeps the wine sound. The wine itself is serviceable, with sweet, candied flavors of pineapple and lemon Lifesavers.",US
4822,US,"This will appeal to lots of people. It's made in the popular style, bearing y ripe citrus, tropical fruit and honey flavors that are set into a creamy texture. It finishes with a touch of smoky, buttery oak.",US
4823,US,"Better known for red wines, Hendry often produces a very good Chardonnay. This 2010 shows fine acidity and sweet flavors of tropical fruit, vanilla and buttered toast.",US
4824,US,"The latest release of the H3 Chardonnay shows plenty of fruit upfront (20% was fermented in stainless steel). Firm, crisp apple and a buttery finish set this clearly in the mainstream Columbia Crest style.",US
4825,US,"Pretty on the nose with whiffs of ripe honeydew and orange blossom, this is a dry, elegantly structured Chardonnay that balances sharp, angular acidity with a rich note of sweet vanilla cream.",US
4826,US,"Squeaky clean and bright, with an abundance of fresh apple and citrus notes on the nose and palate, this unoaked wine is rich with fruit and a luscious body, but balanced with brisk tangerine acidity. It is pristine and easy drinking.",US
4827,US,"Rich doesn't begin to describe the layers of flavor and texture. This wine is massive, with notes of tropical fruit and apricot, with a slightly botrytized character that Sleepy Hollow Chardonnays often display. The oak is lavish and buttery, but perfectly matched to the wine's volume. It also has classic Monterey acidity—as pert as a squeeze of lime. Delicious, full bodied and exotic, it defines its vineyard and appellation.",US
4828,US,"This is White Oak's best Chardonnay in years. The wine benefited from the chilly vintage, expressing citrus and tropical fruit flavors while preserving its vital acidity. It shows real elegance.",US
4829,US,"The winery strikes a happy balance between richness and elegant austerity with this bone-dry offering. It's minerally and reserved, offering intriguing hints of apricots and tropical fruits, with notes of buttered toast and smoky vanilla of new oak that many Chardonnay lovers crave. With 29,000 cases produced, this should be relatively easy to find.",US
4830,US,"Not very subtle, but oaky and ripe, with strong flavors of pineapple jam, pear, vanilla and toasty oak. Made in the popular style, at a decent price.",US
4831,US,"A medium bouquet of apple, lemon and a touch of fresh young peach. The oak is there but not overpowering. The palate is well structured with good acidity and a medium weight followed by a lengthy finish.",US
4832,US,"Depends for its appeal largely on oak's vanilla cream and buttered toast flavors, in addition to ripe pineapples and peaches. Made to appeal to the popular style. Could show more nuance and sophistication.",US
4833,US,"Too oaky by far, this simple Chard tastes like a toothpick. The flavors of caramel and smoky char dominate the pineapple fruit, which itself has a candied, sweet finish.",US
4834,US,"Sugary sweet, simple and over-oaked, this Chard has one-dimensional flavors of pineapple candy, vanilla and smoke.",US
4835,US,"There's a lightly spritzy tickle in the mouth, and a metallic undertaste to this Chardonnay. The blend includes 5% each Pinot Gris and Sauvignon Blanc, all done in stainless steel. Thin and a bit green, it does not quite come together.",US
4836,US,"A sweet, simple Chardonnay, with pineapple and orange jam flavors and oak-like vanilla and caramel influences.",US
4837,US,"Dry, crisp and austere, although it's elegant in its own way. Shows citrus, mineral and lees flavors, with some creamy, buttered toast notes.",US
4838,US,"Good and dry, with a firm scour of acidity and an earthiness to the pineapples and pears. This is a fine everyday Chardonnay at a fair price.",US
4839,US,"This pretty good everyday Chardonnay shows slightly sweet flavors of peaches, pineapples and mangoes brightened with crisp acidity. You could even make a summertime wine cooler with it.",US
4840,US,"New oak and ripe fruit combine to produce a user-friendly Chardonnay that's made in the popular style. It's enormous in pineapple, orange, mango and vanilla flavors that are brightened by crisp Carneros acidity.",US
4841,US,"Not one of the better Ethos reserves, this is a mix of buttered nut and light green-apple flavors. It feels just a little flat in the mouth, with a suggestion of beer yeast. Drink soon.",US
4842,US,"For such a luscious, powerfully built wine, there's a surprising delicacy to this Chardonnay, exhibiting dainty hints of tropical fruit and butter cream on the nose and palate. It is nicely balanced, with bright, lemony acidity and a hint of saline that lingers on the finish.",US
4843,US,"Custardy and yeasty, with tropical fruit, Meyer lemon and mineral flavors, accented with a strong taste of slightly bitter lees.",US
4844,US,"With a very pretty nose of perfumed pear, green apple and lime, this unoaked Chardonnay is nicely soft and easy to drink. Made from organic Chardonnay and a touch of Viognier, this smells and tastes of summer. Even without a hint of oak this retains plenty of richness and a fresh vibrancy on the finish.",US
4845,US,"What this Chardonnay lacks in immediate fruity richness, it more than makes up for in austere, complex minerality. The flavors veer towards lemon and lime, with hints of tropical fruit and the sweet smokiness of barrel aging. The acidity is vital and rich. It's a wine that develops complexity as it warms and opens up in the glass.",US
4846,US,"If you like 'em big and oaky, then this one's for you. Aromas and flavors of wood-grilled peaches, roasted red apples, buttery toast and rich nuttiness all generously abound. The mouth is full and slightly fat, with moderate acidity and a medium-length, smoky finish.",US
4847,US,"A little heavy and dense in oak and lees, which tamp down the fruit and give the wine a certain flatness. Nonetheless you'll find grace notes of pineapples, apricots and minerals.",US
4848,US,"Tries for Burgundian richness, but ends up rather common, although it will satisfy fans of buttery, oaky Chardonnays. Shows ripe flavors of pineapple jam, apricot purée and buttered popcorn.",US
4849,US,"Oaky, with harsh flavors of pineapple Lifesaver candy and some sourness in the finish.",US
4850,US,"Tastes as sweet as Lifesaver lemon and pineapple candy, with low acidity.",US
4851,US,"Too sweet and jammy to earn a higher score. Although the acidity is nice and bright, the wine tastes almost cloying in pie-filling pineapples, apricots, mangoes and honey. Needs to be drier, firmer, more nuanced.",US
4852,US,"Thin in orange, apricot and vanilla flavors, with soft acidity, this Chardonnay is okay for big parties and fast food.",US
4853,US,"Way too sugary sweet and simple, with orange and apricot jam flavors.",US
4854,US,"Made in the popular style, with vanilla oak, cream and sweet buttered popcorn notes dominating the pineapples, apricots and peaches. Production was 8,093 cases.",US
4855,US,"Thin and dry, with oak and alcohol flavors modestly enriched with a touch of pineapples, green apples and minerals. Sadly, this is not the glorious Sonoma-Cutrer of the past.",US
4856,US,"Essentially a Washington Chardonnay (with just 6% of the fruit sourced in Oregon), this is sharp-toned and slightly volatile in the nose. It falls a little flat in the mouth, tasting like a soft banana, and fades quickly.",US
4857,US,"There's a lot going on in this complex Chardonnay. The balance strikes you first, with crisp, zesty acidity cleansing the palate and preparing it for the onslaught of flavor. Then a tsunami of grilled pineapples, Meyer lemon pie filling, crème brûlée, butterscotch and vanilla hits. So devastatingly good, you can't keep your hands off it.",US
4858,US,"Textural and leesy, this refreshing Chardonnay also has a pretty, toasty nose. The mouthfeel and barrel notes compensate for the rather light, generic fruit.",US
4859,US,"Made in an elaborately flamboyant style, this Chard is enormously ripe with pineapple-infused crème brûlée, peach custard, toasted meringue and cinnamon flavors. Delicious, but could be crisper.",US
4860,US,"Dry and earthy, this Chard is made in a more restrained style that emphasizes herbs and minerals as much as lemons, limes and pears. Crisp acidity makes the mouthfeel vibrant and clean.",US
4861,US,"Rich and sweetly crisp, this is the kind of Chardonnay millions of people love. It has opulent, creamy flavors of pineapples, pears, vanilla, buttered toast, cinnamon and smoky oak. Totally Californian, and a good buy.",US
4862,US,"Awfully good for the price, with crisp, Carneros acidity and a creamy texture framing nice flavors of pineapples, peaches, green apples, cinnamon spice and minerals.",US
4863,US,"Showing a lot of barrel toast in both nose and mouth, this backs its buttered apple flavor with plenty of acidity. It's like biting into a crisp-tasting slice of apple pie; delicious now, or hold for another 4–6 years.",US
4864,US,"Barrel fermented and aged in American oak for 15 months, this is a big and powerfully oaky Chard with dominating notes of butter, wood-infused stone fruit and apple pie along with a hint of grapefruit oil in the mouth. The finish is toasty  with a lingering vanilla bean note.",US
4865,US,"Aged 14 months in Russian Oak, this is a different kind of Chard with notes of chamomile, fresh mint sprigs, vanilla and cigar tobacco among the more typical melon fruits and lime citrus. Medium-full but a bit flat in the mouth with a solid but quite smoky finish.",US
4866,US,"A little dainty on aromas with hints of nectarine, honeysuckle and licorice. The mouth is ripe and rich with notes of roasted red apple, orangey citrus and a touch of mealy stone fruit. You get a bit of heat on the finish that fades fast and leaves the other fruit flavors lingering.",US
4867,US,"Fruity, with scads of pineapple, green apple, mango and vanilla cream flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. It's made in the popular style, at a popular price.",US
4868,US,"Thin and acidic, with just the barest suggestion of grapefruit juice. Maybe some pineapples. Earns an extra point or two for dryness and elegance, but really lacks richness.",US
4869,US,"Juicy fruit gum flavors abound, a mix of citrus rind and candy. It must be chilled and enjoyed for its forward, simple fruit flavors.",US
4870,US,"A great Rincon Chardonnay, Talley's best ever. So rich and dramatically layered in pineapple tart, Meyer lemon custard, Key lime pie, golden apricot, mango and vanilla oak flavors, yet so briskly acidic and bright, with a firm minerality, like a lick of cold steel. Only 460 cases produced, but worth a special search.",US
4871,US,"Not much going on in this Chardonnay-based Port-style wine. Its not particularly sweet, with basic white chocolate and pineapple cream flavors.",US
4872,US,"A rich, fine Chardonnay that recalls how good this coastal valley can grow the great white grape of Burgundy. Complex in pineapple, pear, tropical fruit, butterscotch and cinnamon spice flavors, it has adequate acidity. At its best now, so drink up.",US
4873,US,"Quite a nice Chardonnay at a great price. It's rich and creamy and plump, with deliciously ripe flavors of pineapples, Asian pears, buttered cinnamon toast and vanilla. The richness is balanced by crisp acidity and a firm minerality.",US
4874,US,"Over the years Mondavi's Reserve has taken a turn toward Chablis. Fans of lush, superripe Chards will find it tart, but it's really balanced and elegant. With a dry tang of minerals, it shows bright Meyer lemon, lime, pineapple and white peach flavors. One-third new oak adds creamy, smoky vanilla complexities. Should develop over the next six years.",US
4875,US,"All Milbrandt fruit has created a sappy, buttery and bright Washington Chardonnay. It bursts upon the palate with a beautiful mix of tropical fruits and caramel. Flavors are rich, persistent and lush. You want more long after the bottle has been drained.",US

4877,US,"Though there's no oak on this Chard, it's still quite rich and ripe with loads of honeydew, yellow peach slices, lightly baked apple and tangerine oil. The mouth is round and lacking a bit more acidity, but as a whole the wine is enjoyable and easy to drink.",US
4878,US,"Fresh and fruity with dominating notes of green apple, young white peach, chamomile and sweet grass. Lime citrus appears in the mouth and on the finish, livening up the moderate weight and medium-length finish.",US
4879,US,"Lots of forward fruit in this Chard that's made in the popular style. Brims with pineapple jam, pear, buttered popcorn and caramel flavors, in a buttercream texture.",US
4880,US,"Barrel fermented, with light flavors of peaches and cream, and a watery mouthfeel that does not quite come together.",US
4881,US,"This is a good, simple, everyday Chardonnay. It has crisp acidity and is dry, and the apricot, orange and pineapple flavors are a little sweet.",US
4882,US,"Ripe tropical fruit and oak dominate this overly sweet Chardonnay. It's very rich in pineapple tart, golden mango, buttered toast and crème brûlée flavors, but lacks dry balance. Tastes like there's a lot of white sugar in there.",US
4883,US,"Chardonnays from this vineyard are virtually guaranteed to be among the richest in California, and Talley's 2008 certainly doesn't disappoint. It's a massively structured, flamboyant wine, tremendous in tropical fruit, pear, peach and apple flavors that taste like they've been baked into a pie, along with the sweet, smoky crust. A tremendous wine that must be paired with equally sized food. Lobster and scallops come to mind, served in rich cream and butter sauces.",US
4884,US,"A rich, creamy wine loaded with toasted almond, vanilla cookie, bright melon and apple, and hints of white peach—there is a lot going on here. The acids sharpen up the fruit flavors, and the wine has a clean edge, along with expressive barrel flavors.",US
4885,US,"Light, tart, slightly green fruit flavors don't add up to much. There is an undertone of old barrel or something not quite fresh. Simple and plain.",US
4886,US,"A lush Chardonnay marked by the integrated balance of all its parts, resulting in great harmony. It's very ripe in tropical fruits and quite oaky and leesy, but like the powerful gymnasts at Cirque du Soleil, all the performers work together as a troupe. Drink with rich, fancy fare, like lobster or scallops.",US
4887,US,This Chardonnay seems a bit overmanipulated; the oak sticks out in the form of vanilla and butterscotch flavors. But you'll also find plenty of tropical fruit and tangerine notes that are brightened by brisk acidity. Drink now.,US
4888,US,"Full of flavors and aromas of grapefruit and pear, this delightful Chardonnay is super-crisp, with restrained barrel influence. Like a freshly baked pie, it's bright and satisfying.",France
4889,US,"A soft, food-friendly wine, this has layers of vanilla and caramel apple, featuing a pronounced, lemony finish. With deeper, darker tones than an unoaked or neutral barrel-aged Chardonnay, Hoopla also retains plenty of acidity and a lurking sweetness.",US
4890,US,"Showing crisp, lemony acidity, this unoaked Chardonnay brims with citrus, gooseberry, pear and vanilla flavors. A fine example of the stainless steel style.",US
4891,US,"This is the winery's most expensive Chardonnay, and it's also easily their best. It shows the ripe, flashy opulence that makes Chardonnay America's favorite white, with an array of pineapple and orange pie flavors. Beyond the richness, there's good acidity and a clean, brisk finish. Drink now.",US
4892,US,"Starts a bit chemically, but that blows off to reveal minor fruit notes of red apple flesh and mushy melon. Light and prickly in the mouth with a medium-length finish. Growing a little tired; drink now.",US
4893,US,"Made in the popular style, with rich, ripe pineapple jam and kiwi fruit flavors enhanced with the sweet vanillins of oak. A good Chardonnay at a fair price.",US
4894,US,"A touch on the delicate side with very soft aromas of white peach, melon and barely browned toast. The palate is light but round with ample flavors of apple core, hard nectarine and citrus rind. Fulfilling and enjoyable without being overdone; pair with chicken or crab salads.",US
4895,US,"Made in the modern style of extreme ripeness, malolactic fermentation and French oak. Shows strong, almost overpowering flavors of tropical fruits, buttered popcorn and vanilla cream that are almost as sweet as a dessert wine. Needs far greater control for this price.",US
4896,US,"Oaky-sweet and simple, with jammy pineapple, tropical fruit and honey flavors. The best thing is brisk acidity and a clean finish.",US
4897,US,"Simple and clean, with fruit juice flavors of peaches, pineapples, apples and apricots. A tiny bit of oak adds the usual creamy vanilla notes.",US
4898,US,"Too sweet and oaky, with sugary vanilla and pineapple jam flavors. Could be a Starbucks drink. Saved a bit by crisp acidity.",US
4899,US,"Too acidic, almost sour, and pretty sweet, with pineapple and orange flavors. Gets the Chardonnay job done, but seems pricey for what you get.",US
4900,US,"Nicely dry, tart in acidity and clean, but flavor-wise, there's not much going on. The tastes are of minerals and alcohol, with a squirt of citrus juice.",US
4901,US,"A tartly acidic, slightly green wine, with mineral, peach, green grape and pineapple flavors. Turns sweet-and-sour on the finish.",US
4902,US,"Shows sweet-and-sour pineapple and orange fruit flavors, like a Chinese restaurant duck sauce. Lacks balance and sophistication, but will please fans of the style.",US
4903,US,"This new vintage of Novelty Hill's estate Chardonnay shows more acid and spice than the slightly richer, creamier 2005, but offers the same superb winemaking. The fruit is a perfect mix of apple, pear, passion fruit and green banana, laced with cinnamon and sweet baking spices. This is that all-too-rare, affordably-priced domestic Chardonnay. It does not require food to “fill in” what's missing—nothing is missing!",US
4904,US,"The oak-influenced nose is an aromatic showcase of honeyed nut, Granny Smith apple, dried caramel and flower petal. Soft and weighty upon entrance, the palate picks up some acidic steam on the midpalate, finishing with a medium-to-long flavor of toasty, warm spiced apple.",US
4905,US,"Soft and smoky, with ripe flavors of pineapple tart, sweet lemon custard, vanilla and cinnamon. Pretty and polished, an easy wine to like.",US
4906,US,"This is a very rich, elaborate Chardonnay, detailed with pineapple, pear, and apricot flavors, and a coating of sweetly smoked, vanilla-tinged oak. The acidity is brisk and fine. It's complex and impressive, yet its high alcohol and some overripeness suggest that it's not ageable—drink up.",US
4907,US,"This never went through malolactic fermentation, resulting in a beautiful, food-friendly offering. First noticed is the brisk acidity that's like a squeeze of sweet Meyer lemon, brightening the tropical fruit and pear flavors. Then the wine's intensity and complexity sink in, leading to a long, spicy finish. Pair this with Asian fare.",US
4908,US,"Ordinary and one-dimensional. The grapes got superripe under the California sun, offering big flavors of pineapples and peaches, liberally accented with oak. But there's not much going on below the surface.",US
4909,US,"There's not a whole lot going on in this Chard, with muted aromas of overripe peach and hints of mealy pear in the mouth. A touch flabby but the finish is clean and the balance solid. The label peels off like a sticker for easy record keeping.",US
4910,US,"The aromas of this wine are a touch honeyed with notes of baked apple and sweet smoke. The finish is medium length, but the alcohol comes through a bit too aggresively.",US
4911,US,"Tastes thin and metallic, with minerally lemon and lime citrus flavors. Partial barrel fermentation adds some creamy richness, but this is still a fairly lean Chardonnay.",US
4912,US,"Shows natural Chardonnay flavors of citrus, pear and apricot, uninfluenced by oak, with citrusy acidity. Not much else going on, but it's dry, and the price isn't bad.",US
4913,US,"This is a terrific Chardonay, one of the best from Napa Valley, and it happens to be from the cooler Coombsville area. It's dry and crisp in acidity, which nicely balances the flamboyantly oaked peach, green apple and herb flavors that are beautifully wrapped into a buttery, creamy texture.",US
4914,US,"A worthy followup to the dramatic '08. Bone dry and zesty in cool-climate acidity, it shows bracing flavors of steely minerals, Meyer lemons, limes and buttered toast. A terrifically complex, Chablis-style wine made for upscale fare, and should develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",US
4915,US,"The wine is still showing a lot of rich new oak flavors: toast, coconut and vanilla crème. Sur lie aging (in 100% French oak) adds plenty of texture and the impression of minerality. Behind the oak is a lush mix of fruits, from tangerine and pineapple through papaya and ripe banana.",US
4916,US,"Fruit-juice sweet, like a pineapple, orange and peach drink, with high, almost sour acidity. Gets the Chardonnay job done.",US
4917,US,"This simple Chardonnay is soft and sweet, with some vanilla oaky notes. It's made in the popular style.",US
4918,US,"Sweet and simple in apricot and pineapple flavors, with a heavy coating of caramelized oak. Drinkable, but disagreeably fruit-juicy.",US
4919,US,"This Chardonnay in a box is the equivalent of four regular bottles, but it's not a very good wine. It's ultradry and acidic, with unripe, vegetal flavors that just approach citrus fruits.",France
4920,US,"There's a lifted citrus aroma that's accented by hints of orange blossom and orange rind on this unique, unoaked Chardonnay. The palate is richly concentrated with shades of tangerine and lemon, and a bristling acidity that keeps things fresh and vibrant.",US
4921,US,"Flavors of toasty oak, butter cream, ripe tangerine and pear combine in this dry, pleasantly complex effort. It's properly brisk in acidity, with a long, spicy finish of pie spice and vanilla bean notes. Don't drink it too cold.",US
4922,US,"Too sweet, almost like a dessert wine, this Chard has sugary flavors of pineapple custard, with caramelized wood vanillins. Could use greater balance and subtlety.",US
4923,US,"A decent price for an everyday Chardonnay that gives people what they like in this variety. It's rich in pineapple jam, pear and honey flavors, with an elaborate coating of sweet oak.",US
4924,US,"Simple and sweet, like a fruit juice blend of apples, peaches and pineapples you buy in the supermarket.",US
4925,US,"Though a bit lead-footed, this Chard throws up some nice cream, honey and clove aromas. While the palate is swamped with vanilla, nice baked apple flavors come through on the finish before fading to a popcorn note.",US
4926,US,"Pretty good, although it's drying out. The pineapple and pear flavors are disappearing, replaced by herbs and vegetables. Drink quickly.",US
4927,US,"Simple and sugary sweet, with peach, pineapple and mango flavors that taste like a supermarket fruit juice. It's okay for an everyday Chard.",US
4928,US,"Made in a tart, citrusy style, like an elegant Chablis, this rich, balanced Chardonnay shows candied flavors of pineapples, lemon custard, Key lime pie and stony minerals. Brisk acidity provides a keen, bracing balance.",US
4929,US,"The blend includes 5% Viognier, a nice touch from winemaker Joy Anderson, as it adds both spice and lift to the Chardonnay. Lime butter and caramel run through the veins of this supremely smooth and soft offering.",US
4930,US,"Vegetal, with an asparagus edge to the citrus fruit flavors. That mars this otherwise clean, dry and zesty Chardonnay.",US
4931,US,"Very tart, almost sour in acidity, with unnaturally sweet pineapple, buttered toast and caramel flavors.",US
4932,US,"A bit vegetal, and a bit sweet on the finish in pineapple candy. Not particularly successful.",US
4933,US,"Even though this wine is nicely dry and crisp, it's too vegetal, with a green bean taste.",US
4934,US,"Here's a simple wine that tastes like a supermarket fruit juice blend of peaches, mangoes and apricots. It's soft and one-dimensional and slightly sweet in the finish.",US
4935,US,"Nervy and brisk with acidity, this is a refreshingly crisp, unoaked Chardonnay, with underripe tropical fruit and lemon notes on the nose and palate. Elegant minerality adds a tonic touch.",US
4936,US,"This brisk, satisfying Chardonnay offers plenty of varietal flavors of tropical fruit and green apple, with a smoky jacket of oak.",US
4937,US,"All stainless-fermented, this clean and fruity wine has pleasant flavors of light peach and pear. It's round and forward, with balancing acidity.",US
4938,US,"This is a tasty Chardonnay, showing lots of pear, orange, mango, vanilla-cream and butterscotch flavors. It tastes on the sweeter side.",US
4939,US,"This unoaked Chardonnay offers aromas and flavors of apples and almonds and a crisp, fresh structure. Elegant but easy drinking, it will pair well with seafood, poultry and lighter cheeses.",US
4940,US,"A to Z is on the money once again with this screwcapped Chardonnay, tight but flavorful with mixed tree fruits and more exotic notes of quince and kiwi. Not as outgoing as the 2006, this will reward chilling and a little bit of breathing time, but it's a fair value and a good quaff.",US
4941,US,"Crisp acidity marks this dry Chardonnay, with forward flavors of pineapples, pears and papaya, grounded with a pleasant minerality and enriched with vanilla oak. It's a wine to drink now.",US
4942,US,"Here's an easy-drinking Chard that provides notes of pear, melon and small white flowers. The acidity is vibrant in the mouth, but the finish falls a bit flat in the end.",US
4943,US,"With 15% residual sugar, this dessert wine is decidedly sweet in apricot, pineapple, pear, honey, vanilla fudge and smoky flavors, with a brisk minerality. It maintains a zesty balance, with crisp acidity.",US
4944,US,"Made in the modern style, this Chardonnay is very ripe and rich in jammy pineapples, green apples and limes, enhanced with smoky, caramelized oak and a creamy, slightly sour note of lees. It's fortunately balanced with crisp acidity. Best now and through 2012 before the fruit goes south.",US
4945,US,"Whether it's the vintage, or simply the evolution of winemaking at this new winery, this reserve Chardonnay is more restrained and structured than past efforts. Still young and compact, it shows succulent green apple and white peach flavors along with toast and butterscotch.",US
4946,US,"Soft and sugary sweet, with pineapple jam flavors. Lots of people will like it, but it's a pretty common Chardonnay.",US
4947,US,"Disjointed from the start, this wine never pulls itself together. Cracker, oily fruit, overripe apples, and some burn in the finish.",US
4948,US,"If this is the reserve, I'd hate to taste the regular. There's almost no fruit, with only a drop of citrus swimming in the alcohol and acidity.",US
4949,US,"A seemingly sweet, simple but likeable Chardonnay, this shows the buttered toast and buttered popcorn flavors so popular among consumers, with rich pineapple and mango notes and a nice burst of Carneros acidity.",US
4950,US,"This shows the two classic markers of this vineyard: brisk, mouthwatering acidity and superripe flavors. The orange and peach notes meld with an apricot tone, which may have a touch of botrytis, lending a hint of honey. For all the richness, it's bone dry and minerally. Lovely now, but these Sleepy Hollow Vineyard Chardonnays age interestingly, gradually losing fruit and gaining nut and earthy notes.",US
4951,US,"This is a lively, bright young white wine that brims with acid-inspired tangerine, lime, quince and clove flavors. It has a little touch of oak, but is really fruit-driven. Represents a nice value in a dry, fairly complex sipper.",US
4952,US,"High acidity and modest alcohol combine to make this dry wine crisp and elegant. It's not particularly rich, but has just enough pear and peach flavors to get by.",France
4953,US,"Tastes a bit sharp and minty in the mouth, but you'll find some good new oaky vanilla and smoke flavors backing up pineapples, green apples and pears.",US
4954,US,"A spectacular Chard, massive and pure in laser-focused Meyer lemon, Key lime pie, papaya, pepper and smoky vanilla flavors, with the most bracing minerality, a real lick of gunmetal. Brilliant now, and the firm structure should let it age smoothly for a good six years.",US
4955,US,"Shows the crisp elegance and clean balance this bottling is known for, with ripe citrus, apricot, tropical fruit and mineral flavors, accented by rich new oak. It's fun to play with this Chard, let it warm up in the glass and see how it changes over the course of a dinner. That's the mark of a great table wine.",US
4956,US,"This regional bottling has been a strong suit of Testarossa over the years, a best-barrel blend from their far-flung coastal empire of vineyards. It's very rich in apricot, pineapple, honeysuckle and smoky oak flavors, and finishes dry and spicy. Shows an elegant complexity that should develop over the next six years.",US
4957,US,"Very dry and somewhat lean, with citrus, mineral and peach flavors. Oak adds a rich coating of buttered toast and smoky caramel. An elegant wine that's at its best now.",US
4958,US,"With pineapple crème brûlée, Key lime pie and kiwi flavors that are accented with sweet, smoky oak, this Chardonnay offers an uptown sip compromised only by a certain herbaceousness. Drink now.",US
4959,US,"Amazingly rich and ripe, defining the Bien Nacido cool-climate style. The grapes hung for a long time in this excellent vintage, getting ripe and balanced, and the wine offers dazzling opulence, while preserving vital acidity. Showcases dessert pastry flavors of pineapples, mangoes, buttered toast, buttercream, meringue and honeysuckle, accented with dusty spices. Simply beautiful from first sniff to the last swallow.",US
4960,US,"A best-of-barrels selection from the winery's various vineyards, this is a lush, intricate Chardonnay made in the modern style. It's fantastically rich in pineapple tart flavors, with the sweet, smoky crust, and more acidic citrus notes of Meyer lemons and limes. Oak aging and lees add fortunate layers of buttered toast and cream. Very intricate, with Chablisian dryness and minerality. Now–2014.",US
4961,US,"About as rich and flamboyant as California Chardonnay gets, a wine that blows you away with sheer pyrotechnic wizardry. Massive in grilled pineapples, mangoes, Key lime pie, vanilla honey, crème caramel and dusty spices, accented with perfect acidity.",US
4962,US,"A beautiful Chardonnay for drinking now. It's dry and crisp, with pineapple, peach and pear flavors accented with vanilla oak and creaminess from lees aging. Despite the richness, there's a firm minerality, a tang of steel that makes the wine bracing. The grapes are from a vineyard in the southerly, cool Coombsville area, an area that needs its own appellation.",US
4963,US,"Shows all the richness you could want in a Chardonnay, with smoky, buttery flavors of pineapples, lemons and pears, wrapped into a smooth, creamy mouthfeel. A scour of minerals gives the wine a steely grounding, while brilliant acidity makes the finish ultraclean. Really beautiful, a top Russian River Chardonnay at a fair price for the quality. The vineyard is in the cool Green Valley.",US
4964,US,"Extremely rich and ripe, with tremendous pineapple, pear, mango and white flower flavors that have been liberally oaked. Shows a touch of bitterness in the finish, which is probably the result of its age. Still, it's a flamboyant, impressive Chardonnay, like a magnificent old tapestry that's fraying a bit around the edges.",US
4965,US,"Abundant flower notes meld with hints of toast and pear on this dry, easy-drinking Chardonnay. The palate is creamy in texture, with flavors of sweet cream and fresh apple that linger richly on the finish.",US
4966,US,"Hints of smoke and toast add warmth to the fresh pear and blossom aromas. An easy-drinking blend of stainless-steel- and barrel-fermented wine, it's bright with fresh fruit, but it's lusciously textured on the palate.",US
4967,US,"Rich and extracted, with pineapple tart filling, butterscotch, caramel and smoky flavors. Feels a bit soft, and the oak sticks out.",US
4968,US,"Here's a bone-dry, crisp, minerally Chardonnay that will be great with shellfish. It has subtle flavors of limes, Meyer lemons and figs. Very clean and refreshing.",US
4969,US,"A bit heavy-handed in the high alcohol that gives a touch of heat, which in turn accentuates the oak. Soft, too. The tropical fruit flavors are opulent, but the wine needs greater structural balance.",US
4970,US,"Fine balance is a hallmark for all Adelsheim wines. This shows a mix of citrus and apple fruit, with the tartness of gooseberries as a nod to the cooler vintage. There is some pleasing complexity, with an emphasis on herbs and high-acid fruits.",France
4971,US,"From the wildest, most remote and exotic stretch of the Sonoma Coast: you can taste the salt of the sea in this wine, as you can in a Manzanilla Sherry. It gives a tang to the lemondrop, pear and honeysuckle flavors, with their lick of cold granite. So pure and vibrant, so savory, so compelling. Grows more fascinating with every minute in the glass.",US
4972,US,"A nice followup to the winery's 2005, the '06 shows similar richness at the same price. It's expressive in ripe pineapple, peach jam and honey flavors, with buttered toast and smoky oak overtones.",US
4973,US,"Tastes oaky and ripe, with smoky, butterscotchy flavors of pineapples, candied apples and pear jam. Production was 3,232 cases.",US
4974,US,"The oaky power of this wine is its hallmark, giving smoky, buttered toast, vanilla and woody extract tastes to the underlying pineapple and pear flavors. Would be better if the oak weren't quite so dominant.",US
4975,US,"The grapes from this vineyard in the Petaluma Gap typically get very ripe, while maintaining the acidity needed for balance. Tandem's ‘05 is richly elegant and riper than in the past, with opulent flavors of nectarines, candied peaches and pears, marzipan, honeysuckle, butterscotch and cinnamon. Should stay at its peak for several years.",US
4976,US,"Dry, crisp and minerally, this Chard has intensely pure flavors of ripe white peach, pear, green apple and pineapple that have a stony scour of cold steel. It's the opposite of the modern style of oaky fruit bomb Chards, with an elegant integrity that's food-friendly and ageworthy. Fine now, and should do interesting things for a decade.",US
4977,US,"Concentrated and textural, this puts bright fruit flavors of apple and pear up front, adding lush caramel from fermentation in Burgundy barrels. Completely non-interventionist (no acid or water additions), this immaculate wine brings the winery's customary bold aromas into play, following with the crisply defined fruit, rind and barrel notes. The finish is like caramel-dipped apples.",US
4978,US,"Shows the typicity of the vineyard, an angular, minerally wine with crisp acids and concentrated flavor. The tastes of white peaches, pineapples and tangerines are edged with zesty spices. Finishes with vanilla-honey coating of toasty oak.",US
4979,US,"This is minimal intervention winemaking, using native yeast, then put through 100% malolactic and given weekly batinage (lees stirring) in 50% new barrels. The grapes are from Stillwater Creek, delivering ripe, tangy flavors of lime, pineapple, apple, pear and nectarine; all with a firm acid underpinning.",US
4980,US,"A big, powerful and fruity Chardonnay, made in the classic style of this cool-climate vineyard. It's massive in pineapple, kumquat, buttered toast, vanilla cream and cinnamon spice flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Should develop mineral, nut and dried fruit notes over the years, if you want to cellar it.",US
4981,US,"Very ripe, rich and new-oaky, with dazzling flavors of ripe pineapples, pears, limes, caramel and buttered toast, drizzled with vanilla honey. A crowd-pleasing Chardonnay of enormous power and concentration. Could use a touch more nuance and complexity, but a tremendous wine at a good price for the quality.",US
4982,US,"Not for fans of rich Chardonnays, this is a very dry, acidic bottling. It's more about clean mouthfeel and scour than hedonism. What fruit there is suggests limes, pears and brisk minerals, while smoky oak and lees contribute toasty, buttery, creamy notes. A distinguished and elegant wine that defines cool-climate coastal conditions. Grows more complex and interesting as it warms in the glass.",US
4983,US,"A very rich Chardonnay, notable for its complex flavors of pineapples, sweet Meyer lemons, Key lime pie, buttered toast and smoky caramelized oak. Acidity is quite high, and plays a role in the way it tingles and cleanses the mouth. There's a fresh, jammy quality that makes the wine taste younger than its almost three years. Should develop in the bottle through 2013.",US
4984,US,"This is what good, cool-climate Chardonnay tastes like without oak barrel influence. It's a dry, crisply acidic and strongly flavored wine, bursting with ripe pineapples, peaches, green apples and vanilla.",US
4985,US,"Toasty and light, the Evergreen vineyard designate has finished fermentation in mostly new oak, and carries that toastiness through its finish. The fruit flavors are simple and pleasant, but don't carry much concentration or weight.",US
4986,US,"Lean and minerally, with dry, crisp Meyer lemon, pineapple and toasty oak flavors. Starts off a bit sulfury and seems rushed to market. Better by mid-2010.",US
4987,US,"This is rich in pineapple, mango, honey and smoky vanilla flavors, with a creamy richness and bracing acidity.",US
4988,US,"This is an easy Chardonnay, seemingly sweet and ripe in apricot, orange and mango flavors, with vanilla and buttered toast notes from the oak aging. Mouthwatering acidity provides great balance.",US
4989,US,"An uneasy mix of steel and butter, this may just need a bit more time to settle. At the moment, the twin elements of metal and popcorn clash and compete. For those who love the buttery style, this should prove pleasing.",US
4990,US,"A very nice Chardonnay at a friendly price. It shows familiar peaches-and-cream and buttered toast flavors, with a dry, clean finish. Easy to find, with 3,500 cases produced.",US
4991,US,"Unique and distinctive, this unusual effort mixes ripe, lightly peachy fruit with aggressively smoky barrel notes. It's a difficult wine to score ; although this is not a technically perfect bottle, it delivers a lot of flavor—if you really like smoke.",US
4992,US,"Rich, forward and delicious, this has pineapple and peach jam flavors, with elaborate notes of buttered toast and caramel from the oak aging. It finishes dry.",US
4993,US,"Tastes too oaky and extracted, making the sweet wood, butterscotch, pear jam, peach cobbler and pineapple custard flavors a little obvious. But it will satisfy fans of this style.",US
4994,US,"Shows the bright, citrusy acidity and ripe fruit the vineyard is known for. Really quite an exotic Chard, with waves of papaya, persimmon, Meyer lemon, Asian spice, buttercream and vanilla smoke flavors. Should develop well. Drink now–2012.",US
4995,US,"This is just the second vintage of the Lumière Chardonnay from this rising star winery, and it is already causing a buzz. Washington produces very few high end white wines that would be natural companions to its reds on a restaurant wine list. This tight, precise, concentrated and focused Chardonnay fills that need. Though loaded with tropical and stone fruit flavors, this retains its acidic spine and finishes with plenty of toasty, buttered nut, barrel flavors.",US
4996,US,"A solid Chardonnay that will satisfy fans of the variety. It's a sleekly tart, streamlined wine, with vanilla oak and buttered toast influences acting on the pineapples and green apples. Finishes a little sweet, but crisp.",US
4997,US,"Really delicious, a rich, opulent wine that beguiles from first sip to last. It's sweetly caramelized and vanilla-oaky, with crisp acidity brightening ultraripe flavors of pineapples, golden mangoes and buttered toast.",US
4998,US,"Made in a leaner, acidic, minerally style, this bone-dry wine feels ultra-clean and distinguished in the mouth. It's austere, but you'll find a core of pineapples, apples and limes. Great with a shellfish-inspired risotto. Elegant and food-friendly, it should develop over the next 4–5 years.",US
4999,US,"Too oaky, this is dominated by buttered toast and crème bruûlée flavors. Underneath all that are some nice notes of pineapple, orange and apricot. Drink up.",US
5000,US,"This Chardonnay balances fresh and lush flavors, offering a toasty spice and apple nose and flavors of creamy vanilla toast and apple, peach and warming spice. Approachable but displaying some complexity. A friendly everyday white.",US
5001,US,"High in acidity, with the tang and taste of a kefir lime, this barrel-aged Chardonnay has richer notes of vanilla, buttered toast and cream. Good price for a food-friendly wine.",US
5002,US,"Bone dry, acidic and subtle in citrus and tropical fruit flavors, this is a Chardonnay that doesn't insist on standing on its own. Instead, it's perfectly content to let the food star, remaining in a supporting role. For pairings, lobster risotto comes to mind, or just a delicious mayonnaise-based sandwich.",US
5003,US,"Simi winemaker Steve Reeder has produced an utterly delicious wine with this barrel-fermented beauty, the best nonreserve Chard from the winery in nearly 10 years. It shows flamboyant, complex flavors of tropical fruits, green apples, pears, butterscotch and smoky vanilla, with crisp, clean Russian River acidity. This is a good price, and the wine should be easy to find, with nearly 20,000 cases produced.",US
5004,US,"Made with organically grown grapes, this tawny-colored Chardonnay is ready to go. It shows well-evolved flavors of ripe apple and pear, with a cidery finish. Despite the Columbia Valley labeling, it is from Horse Heaven Hills.",US
5005,US,"Made of equal parts ultraripe pineapple and exotic lime fruit, coupled with sweet, smoky crème brûlée and buttered toast from oak and lees stirring, this is a super-rich Chardonnay. Don't drink it too cold; it matures and knits together as it breathes in the glass.",US
5006,US,"Opulent and captivating, this Chard captures the rich, bells and whistles style of California, while maintaining a sense of style and elegance. Coastal acidity provides a bracing structure for the ripe pineapple, lime, pear, white flower and mineral flavors.",US
5007,US,"This is a very rich Chardonnay. It has complex, lush flavors of pineapples, lemons, limes, oranges and the smoky vanilla notes from 100% new oak. High acidity fortunately provides crisp balance. Almost too much of a good thing, it calls for equally rich fare, such as lobster or Ahi tuna tartare.",US
5008,US,"This is an austere Chardonnay whose minerality and acidity star. That's not to say it's not fruity. It has pineapple and green apple flavors, with oak and lees adding richer complexities. Still, it's a firm, Chablis-style wine, and a very good one that defines the elegant sleekness of the Sonoma Coast.",US
5009,US,"This seems as sweet as a fruit tart, featuring pineapple and orange jam flavors, with an oaky hit of buttered toast. Brisk acidity provides needed balance, but it's still pretty simple.",US
5010,US,"Always a wine that shows a powerful oak influence, this new Indian Wells seems soaked in buttered popcorn flavor. The finish comes out a little bitter, with little fruit flavor to round it out.",US
5011,US,"This shows flavors of honey, tropical fruit, vanilla and smoky oak that are wrapped into a creamy texture. It will satisfy your basic Chardonnay needs.",US
5012,US,"This full-bodied Chardonnay begins with aromas of vanilla toast, herbs and cream, followed by toasty spice and fruit flavors. The finish is lingering and curvy. Not terribly complex, but a good cohort to lobster, crab and creamy pasta dishes.",US
5013,US,"Made in a ripe, oaky style, this Chardonay has soft, luscious flavors of pineapple jam, pears, vanilla cream and buttered toast.",US
5014,US,"Brisk acidity and a steely, minerally dryness make this Chardonnay particularly savory. The citrus flavors suggest limes and Meyer lemons, with suggestions of toast and vanilla. It's an elegant wine and easily worth the price.",US
5015,US,"Fresh and spicy, this tart young Chard has a streak of wintergreen mint. Aged in a mix of stainless steel and neutral French oak, it's an excellent seafood wine.",US
5016,US,"Marked by a lean minerality, this Chablis-style wine is not one of those fat, opulent Chards that dazzles with sheer richness. It's more subtle than that, and more acidic. Structure, in fact, is the name of the game here, with its lemon and lime flavors that barely break into green apples. Fine now, if not served too cold, and for the next 2–4 years. Beyond that, wines of this kind go quickly downhill.",US
5017,US,"Pure and detailed, this lovely Chardonnay carves its way through the palate with layers of pear tart, apple crisp, brioche and almond paste. It is an elegant wine, light and penetrating, with a finish that seems to linger forever.",US
5018,US,"Made in the Sleepy Hollow style, extraordinarily ripe, almost botrytized in apricot and honey flavors like a dessert wine, except that it's bone dry. Really epitomizes this vineyard and corner of Monterey, where Chard ripens to beautifully while maintaining acidity.",US
5019,US,"Creamy with a smooth streak of rich butterscotch, this is a very appealing wine that seems to gather strength as it slides through the mouth. It hits a whopping 15.3% alcohol, and yet retains a silky feel and a nice mix of peach, apricot and papaya fruits. It just goes on and on, almost like a dessert wine without the sugar.",US
5020,US,"From the estate vines, this toasty wine will please those who love a soft and buttery style of Chardonnay. Buttered popcorn, toasted walnuts, soft and ripe tropical fruits all come into play; Bonair's definable house style.",US
5021,US,"Very dry, crisp and minerally, with subtle citrus fruit and floral flavors, this Chardonnay suggests Chablis as its model. The elegant structure is likeable. If you're a fan of big fruit, it's not for you, but it's quite a classy Chardonnay. Good with cracked crab with drawn butter and buttered sourdough bread.",US
5022,US,"A dry, somewhat lean Chardonnay marked by suggestions of lemons and limes, with some oak and lees influence, and notes of fresh herbs. Almost like Sauvignon Blanc in its tart, lemony feeling. Drink now.",US
5023,US,"This hits it right in the sweet spot for Chardonnay-loving consumers, with buttered toast, honey and grilled pineapple flavors. It's part of Delicato Family Vineyards' Noble Vines series.",US
5024,US,"This tastes sweet and creamy, with buttered toast, buttered popcorn and tropical fruit flavors. It's made in the modern style, and despite its shortcomings, it will appeal to many Chardonnay fans.",US
5025,US,"A little soft and direct, with jammy, pie-filling flavors of pineapples, tangerines, pears and apricots. Drink now.",US
5026,US,"Nice and crisp, with rich flavors of apricots, pineapples and pears, accented with smoky oak and a scour of coastal acidity. But finishes a little too sugary sweet.",US
5027,US,"This soft and seductive wine is reminiscent of a good Chassagne-Montrachet from a relatively warm year. It has the same ripe, lightly tropical fruit, inflected with citrus and buoyed by firm acidity. The use of oak is restrained, the balance perfect, and the finish long and satisfying.",US
5028,US,"There's too much oak on this wine, and the underlying fruit isn't strong enough to support it. The result tastes like toothpicks, with modest flavors beneath of tangerines and pears.",US
5029,US,"An awkward Chard that tastes unnaturally oaky, with medicinal flavors of toasted, sweet vanilla bean. You'll find hints of pineapples and papayas, but that oaky thing is really strong.",US
5030,US,"An  everyday Chard, with superripe pear and apricot flavors and a thick coat of smoky oak.",US
5031,US,"A thoughtful blend from vineyards representing the Wahluke Slope, Yakima Valley and Columbia Gorge AVAs. Complex and nuanced, this weaves together peaches, apples, honeydew melon, pepper, cinnamon and a vein of clean, wet rock. Great structure suggests this could be cellared for another five or six years.",US
5032,US,"Rich in citrus and tropical fruit flavors, but superbly dry and crisp in cool-climate acidity, with a wonderful, stony minerality. Comes down squarely on the dry, steely side of the Chardonnay spectrum, but no less complex and interesting.",US
5033,US,"A beautiful Chardonnay, creamy, dry and elegant. There's a tangy minerality underlying the rich tropical fruit, apple, pear and buttered toast flavors. This is an elegant and sophisticated wine from the Carneros region.",US
5034,US,"A nice Chardonnay whose rich, sweet smoky oak is pronounced, but doesn't dominate, as it does on their reserve Proximus bottling. Shows a nice minerally and slight herbal taste to the pineapples, apples and peaches.",US
5035,US,"Lots of crisp, citrusy acidity in this wine, which brightens the pineapple, orange, lemon and lime flavors. Meanwhile, 100% new oak adds a rich coating of smoky, buttered toast. The wine is dramatic, rather than subtle, and is at its best now.",US
5036,US,"Pure and clean, this has notes of toasted hazelnut, green apple, lemon blossom and white peach that scream Chardonnay, with zesty acids that keep the medium-bodied palate feeling lively. Although the flavors could use a boost of concentration, it's a fine wine to pair with chicken or tilapia.",US
5037,US,"Fine acidity, dryness and a cold minerality undergird the tropical fruit flavors, making it particularly likeable and food friendly. It showcases the ability of this little appellation in the middle of the Salinas Valley, just below the Santa Lucia Highlands, to ripen white wines.",US
5038,US,"Here's a racy, chiseled Chardonnay, with a pleasant veneer of smoky, buttered toast from new oak that enriches the lime and peach fruit. Elegant rather than powerful, it's a food-friendly wine. Try with lobster risotto.",US
5039,US,"Crisp and lean, with mineral, lemon and ripe grapefruit flavors, this is enriched with a sweet note of honey. The acidity is keen, and while the wine is a little severe, it's so elegant. Drink now.",France
5040,US,"Still quite young yet unmistakably lush, this bottling immediately shows fresh apples, white peach and plenty of new oak from 100% barrel fermentation. The lip-smacking acidity keeps fruit and oak in balance; all that is needed is a bit more bottle age. Decant it if you plan to drink it immediately.",US
5041,US,"With an over-oaked taste and sugary flavors of peach, pineapple and apricot jam, this Chard is more like a dessert wine.",US
5042,US,"Here's a bright, crisp young Chard. It's bone dry and vibrant in Meyer lemon, tropical fruit, spice and vanilla smoke flavors, with a keen, tangy streak of minerality. Tremendously versatile as a food wine due to its balance and finesse.",US
5043,US,"Made in the drier, leaner, earthier and more Chablisian style that's increasingly popular, this Chardonnay is a natural for food pairings, such as shellfish. It's a minerally wine, with elegant citrus, kiwi and pear flavors and a streamlined complexity.",US
5044,US,"All Stillwater Creek fruit and 100% varietal, this bright and spicy, unoaked Chardonnay showcases very pretty fresh herb along with the usual green apple and pear fruit flavors. Lively and light, despite its 14.4% alcohol, it's a versatile and refreshing white.",US
5045,US,"Smells a bit underripe, with a whiff of fresh asparagus, and richness is missing in the mouth. The flavors are of citrus fruits, lees, oak and fresh herbs. Nicely dry and crisp, but rather lean.",US
5046,US,"Sharp and spicy, this light Chardonnay hints at almond and coconut, solidly anchored in green apple fruit. The finish thins out quickly, but it's a fine food wine.",US
5047,US,"There's no oak on this Chardonnay, but it's so rich, you don't even notice. It's all pure, ripe pineapple, orange and lime fruit, accompanied by tart, clean Green Valley acidity. Tremendously versatile with food.",US
5048,US,"A seemingly oxidative hint lends aromas of nut and toast, with added notes of spiced, sautéed orchard fruit and white currant. The acids feel soft and malleable upon entrance, but they pick up some energy on the midpalate. The finish is short to medium in length.",US
5049,US,"This heavy, oaky wine shows the pitfalls that Napa Valley Chardonnay can fall into. While it's very rich and sweet in tropical fruit and honey, it's soft and structureless, and tastes like it's already going downhill.",US
5050,US,"Here's a soft, seemingly sweet and simple wine, with jammy orange, mango and buttered toast flavors.",US
5051,US,"The expressive nose on this full-bodied white evokes pear and apple, while flavors of butter, vanilla and apple unfold on the palate. Good for fans of rounder Chardonnays. Pair with crab, lobster or poultry dishes with cream sauces.",US
5052,US,"Smells and tastes a bit funky, with a sweaty note to the buttered toast, grilled pineapple and cinnamon flavors. Feels kind of soft and flabby. Decant before serving.",US
5053,US,"Ripe and oaky, this offers the sweet fruit and buttered toast flavors Chardonnay lovers crave. It tastes like a candy bar, with pineapple, mango, roasted almond and honeyed granola flavors, all brightened with crisp acidity.",US
5054,US,"Simple, sweet and oaky, this Chard has ripe flavors of tropical fruits, pears, lemon tarts and vanilla. It's fine for big parties where Chard is in demand.",US
5055,US,"Oaky and direct in ripe tropical fruit, with a gooseberry taste more akin to Sauvignon Blanc, this Chard is unripe and simple.",US
5056,US,"Starts with an opulent, inviting aroma of smoky honey, vanilla, tangerines, Meyer lemons, yellow apricots, green apples and minerals. In the mouth, the flavors are very similar—an explosion of fruits, spices and toast. Just a tremendous wine, but for all the volume and complexity, it's completely balanced.",US
5057,US,"Available only in magnums, this Chard consists of a single barrel from the estate vineyard, which is in the Petaluma area, a very cool region. The wine is very fine. It's equal parts ripe green pears, Meyer lemons and smoky oak, with a firm, steely underpinning of minerals. Should age well for a Chardonnay, especially in the big bottle.",US
5058,US,"This is a very low-production, best-of-barrels selection by the winemaker. It's an extremely tight young wine, austere and almost searing in acidity, with a yeasty taste from sur lies aging. If you're looking for opulent, immediately accessible Chardonnay, this isn't for you. But the wine has tantalizing hints of grilled pineapples and nectarines, and the powerful structure suggests cellaring. Stash this away for a couple of years.",US
5059,US,"If you like your Chards Burgundian style, you love the creamy complexity of this one. Only slightly oaked, it bursts with pineapple custard, green apple butter, guava, crème brûlée, vanilla, toast and cinnamon flavors, with a very long, honey-spicy finish.",US
5060,US,"The oak really stands out, so if you're sensitive to that, avoid. But others, including this reviewer, will find the toasty vanilla, meringue, butterscotch and char flavors perfectly in keeping with the ripe tropical fruit, pear and Meyer lemon flavors.",US
5061,US,"Lots of acidity and dryness in this Chardonnay. It will strike some as austere and lean. But it's fascinating in its citrus fruits and minerals, which seem to come from the stones of the Arroyo Seco. Oak influence adds much-needed notes of buttered toast. Gets better and better as it warms in the glass.",US
5062,US,"A deliciously savory wine, brisk in lip-smacking acidity, with the strong, pure flavors of limes, Meyer lemons and kiwi fruits that mark this cool climate region of San Luis Obispo County. Pretty much as good as Edna Valley Chardonnay gets. Drink now.",US
5063,US,"A bit rough and scoury in texture, but otherwise this dry sparkling wine has rich, complex flavors of citrus fruits, strawberries, brioche and vanilla. Shows fine Mendocino acidity that makes it finish brisk and clean.",US
5064,US,"A very good Chardonnay, fancy and elegant, although it's a little sharp in the mouth, and lacks a certain hedonistic appeal, especially at this price. Shows dry, oak-inspired flavors of pineapples, green apples and pears, with a firm minerality.",US
5065,US,"This nice, everyday Chardonnay is made in the modern style, showcasing appealingly ripe fruit. With a coating of sweet vanilla and buttered toast from the oak, it also shows pineapple and orange flavors.",US
5066,US,"Some new oak lends a sweet, smoky edge of buttered toast to this ripe Chardonnay. Its pineapple and pear flavors are highlighted by crisp acidity.",US
5067,US,"A good everyday Chardonnay, with sweet, jammy flavors of pineapples, apricots, tangerines, vanilla and cinnamon. Finishes creamy and dry.",US
5068,US,"Oaky, with butterscotch, vanilla cream and caramel flavors that swamp the underlying pineapple and pear fruit. If you're a fan of super-oaked Chardonnays, it's for you.",US
5069,US,"With a generous bite of acidity, this fine Chardonnay is extremely flavorful. Traditionally one of the winery's top Chards, it's explosive in pineapple, Asian pear, crème brûlée and roasted marshmallow flavors. Finishes in a swirl of creamy, buttery spices.",US
5070,US,"This is the winery's best Chardonnay blend. It comes mainly from Sanford & Benedict Vineyard, and shows the fine structure associated with the appellation. Juicy acidity firms up the oak-inspired Meyer lemon, crushed pineapple and tangy mineral flavors. Should soften and become more complex over the next six years.",US
5071,US,"This is a terrific wine, extremely powerful in fruity flavors. It impresses for its sheer volume. Waves of apricots, nectarines, pears, green apples, butterscotch, buttered toast and smoky, vanilla-tinged oak surf the palate, carried along on a wave of crisp acidity.",US
5072,US,"This cold-climate vineyard is source to some of the most powerful Chardonnays in California. The '05 shows the massive tropical mango, guava, nectarine, apricot and pineapple flavors the vineyard effortlessly delivers. Almost over the top, it's saved by very crisp acidity.",US
5073,US,"Year after year, Bonterra crafts splendidly pure varietal wines, from organically-grown grapes, and in large quantities that make them easy to find. The '06 Chard is delicious in pineapple, sweet Meyer lemon, tangerine, lime and caramelized vanilla oak flavors that finish clean and long. What a super value.",US
5074,US,"A fine Chardonnay, showing cool weather influence in the brisk acidity and ripe flavors, which veer toward tart green apples, peaches and tangerines. The oak has been tastefully applied.",US
5075,US,"A little on the simple side, but a pretty good everyday Chardonnay. It has nice, slightly sweet flavors of apricots, pineapples and sweet vanilla oak, offset with bright acidity.",US
5076,US,"A flowery Chardonnay with delicate, almost evanescent flavors of buttercup, buttered toast and grapefruit. It seems overly strong in oak and weak in fruit, showing a minerally spine and raw alcohol. Clean and bone dry, but lacks richness and vibrancy.",US
5077,US,"Very forward in fruit, offering a powerful wave of pineapples, oranges, lemons, limes and peaches. Fortunately, all this richness is dry, and brightened with crisp, tart acidity. Suggests a rich lobster or shrimp risotto.",US
5078,US,"A beautiful Chardonnay at a great price compared to what's out there. Shows brilliantly ripe pineapple, pear and guava flavors, with crisp Central Coast acidity and a bracing minerality. Nice to drink by itself, with shellfish or even with a citrus fruit pastry for dessert.",US
5079,US,"A beautiful Chardonnay notable for its food-friendliness. Strikes a firm path toward dryness and minerality, with suggestions of citrus, peach and vanilla. The racy acidity is wonderful. Defines elegance in Chardonnay, at a good price.",US
5080,US,"This features creamy flavors of orange, nectarine and tropical fruit. The finish is seems a little sweet.",US
5081,US,"An unadulterated Chardonnay with a light-to-medium body, this has tart acidity that drives the palate, but its flavor concentration falls on the low end of the intensity spectrum. Perky and zesty, it ends with a zing of light lemonade.",US
5082,US,"As this tastes pineapple-sweet, with a rich, creamy mouthfeel, it is for Chardonnay drinkers who prefer the popular style. The wine is best served chilled with similarly rich, creamy food.",US
5083,US,"Deep and intense on the nose, this has enticing aromas of toasted bread, honeysuckle and sautéed apples, drizzled with dark clover honey. A slight char-like bitterness mars the palate, and the wine's unctuous body is more salient than its flavors are intense.",US
5084,US,"Good price, but a little too soft and sweet for a dry table wine. Shows sugary, pie-filling flavors of pineapples, with lots of vanilla-oak influence.",US
5085,US,"This is a solid, everyday Chard. It's very dry and crisp, with earthy, fruity citrus flavors. The acidity may be a little too high for some people.",US
5086,US,"This is the oaked version of Jason-Stephens's estate-grown Chardonnay. It's rich and deep, yet still smooth, with the grape's trademark apple crispness. The finish lingers with an apple pie note.",US
5087,US,"The price is very good for what you get: a dry, creamy Chardonnay, with tropical fruit, vanilla and buttered toast flavors. A good job by the ice hockey great.",US
5088,US,"Forward and lightly toasty, this barrel-fermented Chard is a very nice summertime sipping wine. Apple and stone fruits combine in a gentle, forward, nicely balanced white wine.",US
5089,US,"Pessagno has a perfect track record with this cool-climate vineyard, consisently producing Chards of this caliber. The wine is tight in acids and flinty minerals, even showing new oaky tannins. But the exotic nuances of roasted peaches and grilled pineapples suggest cellarability. Best after 2008.",US
5090,US,"This is Baileyana's top Chardonnay, and the '06 defines what makes Edna Valley such a special place to grow it. Acidity and ripeness are the stars, with bright, explosive flavors of pineapples, pears, Meyer lemons, limes and kiwi fruits. The smoky, spicy oak is perfectly integrated into this delightful wine.",US
5091,US,"Iron Horse's estate Chard is a remarkably consistent wine. Never overoaked, superripe or heavy, it always has an elegant minerality. The '06, from a coolish vintage, is flavored with green apples, Meyer lemons and Bosc pears.",US
5092,US,"There's something tight and minerally and acidic about this Chardonnay that will appeal to connoisseurs of austere wines. Even though the oak is nearly one-half new, the wine has a lean, lemony taste, with nuances of crème brûlée and roasted hazelnuts. Defines food-friendly elegance, and could develop bottle complexity over the next 5 years.",US
5093,US,"Richly oaked, fantastically ripe in long hangtime fruit, this Chard has exotic flavors of golden mangoes, nectarines, passionfruit, pineapple jam and kiwis. Oak adds extra layers of buttered toast, crème brûlée and smoky vanilla. For all the honeyed sweetness, it's totally dry, a tour de force that's at its best now.",US
5094,US,"Clean, zesty and flavorful Chardonnay, with complex notes of pineapples, oranges, Meyer lemon tart, buttered toast and spices. Earns extra points for fine acidity and a bracing minerality.",US
5095,US,"Fermented and aged in Burgundian oak, this is intended to evoke a traditional Meursault style. It isn't far from the mark; soft and oaky, it's a bit like biting into a ripe banana squished between two graham crackers. Other tropical fruit flavors are in evidence: mango, pineapple and papaya. It's an easy-drinking style that will have a lot of consumer appeal.",US
5096,US,"Here is another fine effort from Columbia Crest that captures some spice and keeps the fruit bright and fresh. Apple and citrus flavors, sharp and tangy, run up against lots of barrel toast. The finish is loaded with baking spices and lightly touched with candied orange peel.",US
5097,US,"Heavy, sweet and super-oaky, like a liquid infusion of buttered popcorn, pineapple jam and vanilla meringue. Will appeal to many, but purists will find it heavy-handed and manipulated.",US
5098,US,"As sweet and fruity as Gatorade, with a blast of caramelized oak. It's a Chard made in the popular style to appeal to the broad mass of consumers.",US
5099,US,"Very dry, tart and earthy, this is a solid Chardonnay to drink now, at a fair price. It has everyday flavors of peaches and green apples.",US
5100,US,"A big improvement over the 2007, Stephens' '08 is rich and ripe. It brims with pineapple, buttered toast, vanilla and cinnamon flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Easy to drink, and delicious through the finish.",US
5101,US,"Like a bag of trail mix, this has scents of dried apple, walnut and toasted grain. Medium to full bodied, the mouthfeel is easy and pliant, with a broad orchard-fruit flavor. The acids pick up some vigor on the finish, giving the wine a lifted quality.",US
5102,US,"This tastes like an alcoholic fruit drink with apricot, orange and mango flavors. Still, it's clean and pleasant.",US
5103,US,"Shy, timid notes of white peach and tropical fruit are offset by hints of vanilla and nutty biscuit. It feels medium to full bodied, but this lacks intensity and concentration overall. A touch of spice on the midpalate adds interest.",US
5104,US,"This oozes with sweet oak, honey and buttered toast flavors, with added notes of pineapple cream and peach jam. Few Chardonnays are this opulent; it will have its fans among those who love this style.",US
5105,US,"This has everything that many people love about Chardonnay: It's creamy, buttery and toasty, with sweet tropical fruit and pear flavors. It's pretty flashy.",US
5106,US,"This shows the apricot jam richness often found in California's cool-climate vineyards. There may even be a touch of botrytis, although the wine is thoroughly dry. It's brisk in acidity and well-oaked; big and rich, it's almost a cocktail by itself.",US
5107,US,"Oaky but simple, with smoky, caramel flavors covering thin notes of pineapple sour candy.",US
5108,US,"Sweet in caramelized oak, this Chard also has jammy flavors of pears and apricots.",US
5109,US,"A beautifully elegant, refined Chardonnay. Because it's not overloaded with oak, it displays the basic finesse of the grapes from this cool-climate vineyard. Crisp and dry, it's rich and complex in citrus, tropical fruit, peach, mineral and honeysuckle flavors, at a fair price.",US
5110,US,"Lush in pineapple cream, Key lime pie, kiwi fruit, white peach and apricot flavors, this Chardonnay is as rich as they come. There's also a welcome overlay of zesty, citrusy acidity. The finish is honey sweet, in the modern style.",US

5112,US,"Fans of superfruity, oaky, big Chards will love this one. The grapes came from outside the true Santa Lucia Highlands AVA, but the wine shows similar power, with incredibly ripe, jammy yellow tropical fruit flavors accompanied by rich acidity. There's also a lot of new, smoky oak.",US
5113,US,"Sweet and simple, with strong, honeyed flavors of pineapples, peaches, green apples, vanilla and buttered popcorn. Crisp, coastal acidity fortunately provides balance.",US
5114,US,"This started out as a perfectly nice Chardonnay. It was dry, crisp and balanced, with a minerality under the pineapple and peach flavors. Then the winemaker decided to plaster it with oak, and it tastes like it went through the malolactic fermentation. The quality was lessened.",US
5115,US,"A simple Chardonnay, with likeable pineapple, apple, lime, kiwi and vanilla flavors. Finishes sweet. Seems pricey for what you get.",US
5116,US,"This seems as sweet as fruit juice, with flavors of orange, pineapple and banana. It's creamy and warm, in the way of the modern Chardonnay style.",US
5117,US,"This reserve-level Chardonnay does not outperform the winery's regular bottling. Some light cinnamon spice adorns the clean, simple green-apple fruit.",US
5118,US,"This bottling has been remarkably consistent over the last several vintages. Always exotic in lemondrop-candy fruit that's been well-oaked, it has nuances of flower petals, white peaches, minerals and honey. The '06 may be a little softer than past vintages.",France
5119,US,"Reminiscent of the 2000, this wine has a crisp, linear character that emphasizes minerals rather than the overt tropical fruits the vineyard shows in warmer vintages. It's a fine, dry, acidic Chardonnay whose oak-infused lemon and lime flavors will complement sourdough bread and cracked crab.",US
5120,US,"Full-bodied and oaky, this Chard delivers an action-packed punch of flavor. The peaches, pears, pineapples, vanilla custard and smoky vanilla are so rich, they finish like honey. But the wine is actually dry.",US
5121,US,"Botrytis infected the grapes, but the winemaker has vinified this unique wine totally dry, so you get pure Chard and botrytis taste without the sweetness. Fascinates for the intense dried lime peel, yellow apricot, vanilla and honeyed flavors.",US
5122,US,"Crisp acidity saves this rather sweet, oaky wine by giving it a clean mouthfeel. The flavors are of pineapple and apple juice, honey and vanilla caramel.",US
5123,US,"Light, watery and thin, with simple lemon and green apple flavors, and plenty of acidity.",US
5124,US,"Sweet and simple, with flavors of apricot, pineapple, peach and pear juice.",US
5125,US,"The nose smells hazy, with understated aromas of orchard fruit, toast and white soy sauce. On the palate, it feels one-dimensional and straightforward, with light flavor concentration.",US
5126,US,"This passes basic inspection for Chardonnay, with vanilla- and buttered-toast-inspired tropical fruit and pear flavors, but it's heavy and it tastes sweet. A portion of the proceeds goes to children's charity.",US
5127,US,"The oak sticks out, dominating with toast and excessively sweet flavors. If you can get past that, you'll find a dry, crisp wine, with a note of pineapple.",US
5128,US,"This is rich and appealing in orange and lemon marmalade and buttered toast flavors. It's delicious, balanced by crisp acidity and minerality. A flashy wine worth drinking now for its freshness and vicacity.",US
5129,US,"Good price for a firm, steely Chardonnay that's elegant and dry through the finish. Minerals and citrus fruits mark it, with a Meyer lemon tartness given added richness from 25% new oak fermentation. Ready now.",US
5130,US,"Showing Talley's distinctive elegance and brilliant structure, this Chard is a blend of the Rincon and Rosemary's vineyards. The wine's architecture really makes it special, with acidity and dusty tannins providing the bare bones to the lemon, lime, pineapple and mango fruit. A great wine to have with food.",US
5131,US,"Creamy smooth and enlivened with brisk acidity, this Chard shows forward, tart green apple, lime and pineapple flavors. Oak barrels add even richer notes of buttered toast and butterscotch to this elegant sipper.",US
5132,US,"At first high-toned, this opens nicely with crisp green apple fruit flavors. It's balanced and clear. Don't look for big, blowsy tropical flavors or buttery oak, though the barrel fermentation provides some texture to the finish. A great food wine.",US
5133,US,"A disjointed Chardonnay, with aromas of apricots, grapefruits, limes and wood. Finishes dry and somewhat sour in acidity.",France
5134,US,"A simple Chardonnay, with a soapy mouthfeel, lemony fruit and a hint of almond in the finish.",US
5135,US,"Too sweet and oaky for comfort, with caramelized flavors of pineapple and apple juice that finish with a white sugar aftertaste.",US
5136,US,"Slightly sweet, with simple apple and mango juice flavors and a veneer of oak-like vanillins and caramel. Crisp acidity helps to make the finish clean.",US
5137,US,"Overripe, with apricot and pear flavors, although it's dry. The wine feels heavy and syrupy in the mouth, lacking vibrancy.",US
5138,US,"Sugary sweet and simple, with flavors like a blend of the juices of pineapples, apples and pears. It's also soft, which makes it a little cloying.",US
5139,US,"Astonishingly rich, this is everything you want a Chardonnay to be. It's fantastically concentrated in pineapple, guava, green apple, pear and lime fruits; it's creamy and suave in lees influence; and it's brisk in acidity, despite undergoing malolactic fermentation. The texture is honeyed, with a perfect touch of smoky, new French oak. The estate grapes come from the winery's vineyard high up in the Vaca Mountains, east of the Silverado Trail.",US
5140,US,"This sets a high standard for Oregon Chardonnay. Bright and snappy, yet deep and concentrated, it's a symphony of lemon, citrus, stone and tropical fruits, well-differentiated yet perfectly integrated. The extraordinary length and precise focus, along with the overall balance and structure, suggest that this should improve for many years to come.",US
5141,US,"Gorgeously ripe fruit packs this wine with tropical flavors of cantaloupe, apricot and papaya. Lemony acid keeps it fresh and vibrant, and the overall texture and complexity are a revelation. Both of Evening Land's Chardonnays elevate the grape to new heights in this part of the Willamette Valley.",US
5142,US,"Acidity, dryness and steely minerality characterize this Chard. It has lemon and vanilla flavors that are brisk and clean. It's refreshing to get such an elegant alternative to today's ripe, fruity Chards. Gets better and better as it warms in the glass. Drink this brilliant wine with shellfish, sourdough bread and lots of butter.",US
5143,US,"Very tight now, with minerally, yeasty flavors of lees and unintegrated smoky new oak. High acidity adds to the impression of austerity. Difficult to appreciate in its infancy, but this elegant, layered, complex Chard should begin to blossom after 2008 and hold for several years.",US
5144,US,"Very sweet, with honey-rich apricot, tangerine, vanilla cookie and crème brûlée flavors, this late-harvest Chard satisfies for sheer opulence. It has just enough acidity to balance all that sweetness.",US
5145,US,"Simple, with fruit punch-sweet pineapple and lemon flavors. High acidity makes it a little sour.",US
5146,US,"Very powerful, very strong, almost overwhelming in the sheer wealth of fruit and oak, but balanced with acidity. Winemaker Bob Cabral himself calls it “concentrated.” It detonates on the palate with an almost dessert wine quality of lemons, pineapples, honey, vanilla and minerals, but it's totally dry. Will hold for perhaps six years.",US
5147,US,"Unbelievably rich and decadent, this tastes of honey drizzled over crushed ripe pineapples, guavas and pears. Added hints of buttered toast, vanilla bean, caramel and sweet cream come with scads of savory pie spices.",US
5148,US,"This is the winery's small-production, high-end Chardonnay, which shows the brilliant essence of Edna Valley. Few Chardonnays in the state are this streamlined, low in alcohol, crisp and minerally. An accomplishment in this day and age of fat, oaky bottlings, this has a steely taste that is relieved by subtle hints of lime, vanilla and buttered toast. Only 600 cases were produced.",US
5149,US,"A solid Chardonnay, this is dry, rich and creamy, with lemon, lime and tropical fruit flavors. A touch of oak brings a nice note of buttered toast.",US
5150,US,"This is a stainless-steel-aged Chardonnay with splendid streaks of lemon, honey and kiwi that surround a core of tart apple. It's balanced with good acidity that greets you on the entrance and on the finish.",US
5151,US,"This single-vineyard wine from Foxen's estate is a little too sweet. It seems to contain residual sugar, to judge by the jellied pineapple and apricot flavors. If you don't mind that, you'll find a crisply acidic, clean wine, with oak and lees complexities.",US
5152,US,"Has all your basic barrel-fermented Chardonnay character without being particularly complex. The wine is slightly sweet and oaky-creamy, with apricot, pineapple, peach and spicy mango flavors.",US
5153,US,"Soft and creamy and very elegant, this Chard has rich flavors of apricot tart, pineapple, Meyer lemon and chalky minerals. Really a well-structured, pulled-together wine of enormous appeal. Should improve through 2012.",US
5154,US,"Just what you want from a Sonoma Coast Chard. It's bone dry, crisp in cool-climate acidity, and elegant, with a minerally tang to the Meyer lemon fruit. Oak barrels bring richer notes of vanilla and buttered toast. Beautiful, and should hold through 2012.",US
5155,US,"Oak sticks out on this Chardonnay, with the aroma and flavor of buttered white toast dominating. But there comes an immediate rush of pineapples, limes and peaches, giving the wine a good balance of wood and fruit, and it's very dry and crisp. At its best now, but don't serve too cold.",US
5156,US,"The dryness and minerality of this wine, combined with its clean, brisk elegance, make it a very nice partner for shellfish. The flavors are lemons, limes, and ripe, crisp white peaches.",US
5157,US,"This is a big wine, and not really showing its best now. It's raw-boned. The oak is all smoky and spicy and dominant; the fruit is massive in pears, crunchy apples and pineapples; the acidity on the finish is tart. It needs a year or so to knit together.",US
5158,US,"Stainless- steel fermented, this Chard comes from a very cool part of Russian River Valley. You can taste that in the crisp acids that frame the green apple, pineapple, pear, lime and mineral flavors.",US
5159,US,"This polished Napa Chardonnay would have benefited from brisker acidity, as it's somewhat soft. But the orange popsicle, lemon cream and buttered toast flavors are very rich.",US
5160,US,"A massive Chardonnay, rich in fruit and oak. Shows long, decadent flavors of roasted pineapples, nectarines, honeysuckle, vanilla, buttered toast and meringue, dusted with cinnamon spice and brown sugar. Structure is fortunately provided by crisp acidity and even a framework of wood tannins. Now–2013.",US
5161,US,"There's a hard, minerally edge to this Chardonnay, like the tang of cold metal, an impression that's heightened by its citrusy acids. The flavor veers toward Meyer lemon, while toasted oak brings needed vanilla and honey richness. It's controlled and tight, compared to more opulent bottlings, but it's also elegant and complex. Mount Eden's Chardonnays have a history of aging, and this fine one will go for 10 years or so, gradually losing fruit.",US
5162,US,"Foxen's UU Block from the famed Bien Nacido Vinbeard fights it out every year with the estate Tinaquaic Chardonnay for top honors. In this cool vintage, the former wins out by a hair. Dry, steely and crisp in acidity, it shows vast tropical fruit, orange, vanilla, honey and buttered toast flavors that are delicious and refined. The richness and elegance strongly suggest pairing it with lobster.",US
5163,US,"The grapes for this estate Chardonnay are sourced from the winery's vineyards way up in the Vaca Mountains. This is a flashy wine, showing the ripe tropical fruit, cream, smoke, honey and buttery qualities of a fine Chardonnay.",US
5164,US,"This has slender flavors of tangerine and peach. It's elegantly dry, clean and brisk in acidity, with a light touch of smoky oak—definitely worth the price.",US
5165,US,"Very dry and crisp and minerally. Shows a stony, steely edge to the pineapple, pear and Meyer lemon flavors, with 30% new French oak contributing vanilla, buttered toast and toffee complications. A bit rough now, and should soften and develop bottle complexity after 2010.",US
5166,US,"A pretty good price for a single-vineyard Chard from a great appellation. Unoaked, the wine is very crisp in acidity, with citrus, apricot and mineral flavors that finish dry and clean.",US

5168,US,"Dramatically rich and ripe, a bells and whistles Chardonnay made in the white Burgundy style. It's flamboyant in pineapple, nectarine, guava and oak- and lees-influenced buttered toast, cream and vanilla crème brûlée, but it's also very acidic and dry, which provides balance and elegance. Fine now and for 3 or 4 years.",US
5169,US,"Chardonnay doesn't get much richer or riper than this. Explodes with grilled pineapple, lemondrop, smoky meringue, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors, brightened and boosted by crisp, citrusy cool-climate acidity. Racy and clean and complex, it should develop bottle nuance over the next four years.",US
5170,US,"This wine has varied over the years, but with the cool 2010 vintage, it really shows how fine its terroir can shine. A full degree of alcohol lower than the 2009, it's bone dry, brisk in acidity, and stimulating in its minerally taste and texture—like a lick of cold steel. There is a fortunate streak of Meyer lemon candy that lends enough richness to satisfy. Reminiscent of a fine Chablis, it's drinking well now.",US
5171,US,"Using grapes sourced from a cool subappellation of the Lodi area, this is a fine, ripe wine that finishes sweetly on a note of vanilla. Its acidity is in balance, making this a wine that will easily please a crowd.",US

5173,US,"Tasted in the Spring of 2009, this Chard was immature, marked by fresh fruit acidity and flavors, as well as unintegrated oak. But it's quite good, and just needs time to allow the grilled pineapple, crème brûlée and buttered toast flavors to come together with the alcohol. Best 2010–2013.",US
5174,US,"Crisply dry but very rich, even exotic, in fruit, this Chardonnay is a good value for the money. It's flamboyant in tropical pineapple jam, pears, vanilla custard and buttered toast, with a stony minerality.",US
5175,US,"All the buttered toast, vanilla bean, apricot jam and pineapple crème brûlée you could want is here, but this lovely Chardonnay is lifted above the ordinary by a minerality that gives it a refreshing tang. Crisp acidity also helps to provide structure to the richness. Will have a short life as evidenced by some overripeness on the finish, so enjoy now.",US
5176,US,"There's a lot of crunchy acidity and stony minerality in this Chablis-style Chardonnay. It's got plenty of fruit along the lines of green apples, limes, melons and dates, and is interesting for its sleek architecture.",France
5177,US,"Stainless steel fermented and aged Chardonnay (eg ‘naked') is becoming commonplace, but few offer as much snap and juicy fruitiness as this one. It's a great, round mouthful of grape juice, crisp green apple and suggestions of pineapple and citrus. A little fresh herb rounds out the finish.",US
5178,US,"Made in a leaner, crisper style than many Chards nowadays, this Chardonnay trades power for elegance. It's almost like a Sauvignon Blanc, with citrusy acids framing flavors of limes, pineapples and green apples that have a minerally edge. New French oak adds just the right touch of richness.",US
5179,US,"This massive, explosive Chardonnay is marked by extremely ripe pineapple, pear and peach fruit, accented with lots of sweet, caramelized oak. It's a potent, high alcohol wine whose buttered popcorn flavors are complex by crisp acidity and minerals. A bit obvious, but a fine example of its style.",US
5180,US,"Acidity and minerality lend this Chardonnay a distinctive personality. The cool vintage has given it a certain lean appeal, but that's not to minimize the tropical fruit and sweet oak that give it richness. It's sleek, stylish and moderate in alcohol.",US
5181,US,"The acidity in this Chardonnay stars, giving it a mouthwatering tanginess. There's a solid core of apricot, lime and tropical fruit flavors that give needed richness. A mineral note adds bracing grip. The dryness is just fine, keeping the wine worthy of repeated sipping. Overall, this is a food friendly wine; drink now–2016.",US

5183,US,"Sweet oak and buttered toast flavors dominate this Chardonnay. Underneath there are flavors of pineapple, pear and orange. It's rich, dry and bright in acidity.",US
5184,US,"This is a fairly simple wine. Although it's rich in apricot, orange and tropical fruit flavors, not to mention oak, it's a little overripe and seemingly sweet. The vanilla and buttered toast flavors will appeal to many.",US
5185,US,"Rich and buttery, this has smoky oak and toast flavors that frame the pineapple and orange jam notes. Not overly complicated, this is made in a way that appeals to Chardonnay lovers. Production was a hefty 16,500 cases.",US
5186,US,"Wow—delicious, the best yet. Lots of pineapple from the 75% Celilo fruit, very crisp and lightly butterscotchy. Big but not heavy, with alcohol in the mid-13% range. The wine fills in the midpalate nicely, weaving together rock, metal, butter and tropical fruit flavors in equal proportions. Good length also.",US
5187,US,"Made in the modern, ripe California style of exceptionally ripe fruit, accented with strong oak. Not especially subtle, but flattering to the palate, with opulent flavors of pineapple crème brûlée, peaches, cream, buttered toast, vanilla bean and honeysuckle.",US
5188,US,"Pretty oaky, with buttered toast and crème brûlée flavors upfront, but the pear, peach and pineapple fruit is strong, and so is the acidity, so that the oak is in keeping with everything else.",US
5189,US,"Jordan's Chardonnay was made full-Burgundian style, barrel-fermented in nearly half new oak and aged on the lees. Partial malolactic fermentation has enabled brisk, appley acidity to remain. The flavors are of green apples and nectarines, with a mineral tug. This is an elegant, sophisticated Chardonnay.",US
5190,US,"Bright in acidity, and powerful in flavor, this Chard oozes ripe pineapple, green apple, mineral, honeysuckle and spicy flavors. Totally dry, it's a little tight, and could develop some bottle complexity in a few years. Nice with Asian fare.",US
5191,US,"Shows that distinctive Edna Valley acidity and pure, laser-like Meyer lemon and lime fruit, while new oak and considerable sur lie aging adds richer notes of cream and yeast. Drink now for its vibrant youthfulness.",US

5194,US,"Nice everyday wine, with pleasant peach, pineapple and pear flavors that finish with a touch of smoky oak and vanilla. It's easy to enjoy this one with ham, crab, corn on the cob or just by itself.",US
5195,US,"Super-rich in vanilla and smoky caramelized oak, and ripe in pineapples, peaches and apples, this is a powerful Chardonnay. It's dramatic now in sheer strength, but not an ager, so drink now.",US
5196,US,"Another massive, dramatically rich Chardonnay from Williams Selyem. Purists will find it ponderous, but there's no denying the wealth of pineapple tart, orange custard, crème brûlée, butterscotch and vanilla flavors. Lobster comes to mind as a natural partner.",US

5198,US,"Very rich and dramatic—the grapes used for this wine were grown in a tiny, cool block of the estate in this corner of Cabernet country. It's full, yet balanced, with crisp acidity, tangy minerality and lots of ripe tropical-fruit flavors. This did not undergo malolactic fermentation.",US
5199,US,"This is pretty standard, with good acidity pervading tropical fruit flavors. There's a rich overlay of sweet oak.",US
5200,US,"Light and fruity with pineapple, melon and apple. This fruit forward, food-friendly wine has natural acids and a delicate balance. For the money it is a fine choice to accompany seafood, poultry and pasta salads.",US
5201,US,"A nice wine, good and dry. It has forward peach, pineapple, apricot and oaky vanilla and caramel flavors, and a finely acidic finish.",US
5202,US,"A little soft and candied in its oaky pineapple, applesauce and buttered-popcorn flavors, but easy to drink. Chardonnay admirers will recognize a distinctively Californian interpretation of the variety.",US
5203,US,"This five-vineyard blend of Chard has superripe, possibly botrytised, flavors of apricots and new oak. It's almost late-harvest in style, although it's fully dry. A disappointment.",US
5204,US,"This estate-grown Chardonnay opens with lots of new oak aromas, excellent fruit material, with Meyer lemon, yellow apple, hints of white peach. The phenolics give the wine some excellent texture, and it has a long and smooth finish.",US
5205,US,"Bone dry and complex, with terroir-infused mineral, citrus, pear and sweet green mint flavors. A streamlined, layered wine, although it's just a bit hot in alcohol.",US
5206,US,"With high alcohol and 100% new French oak, this wine could easily be clumsy, but it isn't. It defines the ripe California style. It's a little hot, but so massive in flavors of pineapples, lemondrop candy, crème brûlée and sweet buttered toast, you can't help but be impressed. A winery and wine to watch.",US
5207,US,"With 17% residual sugar, this supersweet wine seduces the palate with intense honey, but sweetness isn't enough. It falls short on the fruit side. If the apricot, peach and pineapple flavors were more intense, this would be a sensational wine.",US
5208,US,"Napa Cabernet specialist Krutz has been assembling a good record for Chardonnay in recent years, and with this release, Krutz reaches into Sonoma Valley, with excellent results.

5216,US,"Oregon Chardonnay in the low 12% alcohol range is well out of the ordinary, but it reflects the vintage conditions in 2010. This is a wine for acid lovers, with very tart green-apple fruit and a bit of spice.",US
5217,US,"There's too much oak for too little fruit in this wine, with the result that it tastes of sappy, smoky toothpicks. Buried under all that wood are modest apricot and pineapple flavors.",US
5218,US,"Kind of simple and sweet, like oaky apple and pear juice. Needs greater dryness and complexity.",US
5219,US,"Pretty oaky, with a flood of caramel and buttered toast, and you have to wonder why they plastered so much barrel influence, because the underlying wine is pretty good. Buried under the wood is a dry, crisp Chardonnay with pineapple, pear, floral and mineral flavors. Give it a good decant and don't serve too cold.",US

Brims with pineapple tart filling, Key lime pie, orange zest, honeysuckle, daffodil and smoky, vanilla-oak flavors, with a creamy, yeasty richness.

5240,US,"Delivers lots of bang for the buck. Shows real Chardonnay character, with rich vanilla cream-infused flavors of ripe pineapples, pears, sautéed bananas, buttered toast and honey. At this price, it's a fantastic buy that can stand next to Chards costing far more.",US

5251,US,"Those used to the fabulous richness of Ed Sbragia's Chardonnays at Beringer might find this disappointing. It's a good wine, with the Burgundian formula of half-barrel fermention in new oak, malolactic fermentation and weekly lees stirring, so it has those winemaker-added notes of creamy, yeasty smokiness. Yet the underlying pear and apple flavors are a little thin.",US
5252,US,"Made in the slightly sweet style that made this bottling famous, this Chardonnay's pineapple, orange and peach flavors are balanced by crisp, coastal acidity. It's a fine sipper at an affordable price.",US

5259,US,"Made from the estate vineyard high up on Mount Veeder, the wine has a brilliant intensity and near-perfect balance. It's big, but not in the usual California style.

5269,US,"The Audrey Cuvée brings extra richness to the regular Diamond T Estate Chard. It's an enormous wine that has honeyed sweetness.

5281,US,"Sugary sweet and simple, with candied, jellied flavors of peaches and oranges.",US
5282,US,"Restrained, vibrant and dry, this shows herb-inflected tropical fruit and citrus flavors, with a yeasty note of lees. Oak lurks subtlely and tastefully in the background. Bone dry, this is more elegant than opulent, making it food friendly.",US
5283,US,"Great price for a big production (5,000 cases) Chardonnay of this quality. It's dry and crisp and elegantly structured, with savory citrus fruit, peach, mineral and vanilla flavors. Easily as good as many Chards far more costly. From Don Sebastiani & Sons.",US
5284,US,"A simple Chardonnay, this seems sweet in pineapple and peach jam notes, with buttered toast and honey flavors from oak. Flashy, but one-dimensional.",US
5285,US,"Simple and strongly flavored, this is powerful in pear, vanilla and buttered toast notes. There's not much subtlety, but it will satisfy fans of this style.",US
5286,US,"The block is the oldest on the estate, with extremely low-yielding vines, and the wine is not produced every year. The resulting Chard is very concentrated and dense. Everything about it is big: the apricot and peach fruit, the smoky oak, the yeasty lees. Tasted in August 2007, the wine was a little disconnected, like the parts of an enormous machine that has not yet been put together. Give this ambitious young wine a year or so to come together.",US
5287,US,"An interesting and complex Chard marked by intense minerality. Calls to mind Chablis in the acidity, dryness and racy taste of cold steel. Also in the flavor mix are tart green apples, pineapples, limes, cinnamon spice and creamy lees.",US
5288,US,"With citrus and floral flavors in addition to Chard's usual pears and apples, this wine might be confused for a Pinot Grigio or even a leaner style of Viognier. However you slice it, it's a dry, crisp, easy sipper, and a good buy at this price.",US
5289,US,"Made in an appealing popular style, this Chard has ripe flavors of pineapples, pears, peaches and figs, with oak barrel notes of creamy vanilla and smoke.",US
5290,US,"Vibrant and racy, this Chard's bright acidity boosts and brightens the lime, pineapple, Meyer lemon and vanilla flavors. Try with grilled salmon with a tropical fruit salsa topping.",US
5291,US,"This is a powerful Chardonnay. It's explosive in tropical fruit, in malic acids and in new charred oak. All the parts kind of stick out on their own, going in different directions. It's a good New World style, but it should have more synergy.",US
5292,US,"Sweet, fruity and oaky, this Chard has flavors of peaches, pineapples and smoky vanilla.",US
5293,US,"A little on the thin side, fruit-wise. Shows modest peach and pear flavors, with lots of caramelly, toasty oak.",US
5294,US,"Tastes way too oaky, with a plaster of sweet vanilla and caramelized charcoal. The underlying pineapple fruit just isn't strong enough to support all that wood.",US
5295,US,"An unoaked Chard that's more than a little sweet. Tastes like a spicy mix of apricot, peach and orange jam.",US
5296,US,"Sweet and medicinal, with candied apricot and honey flavors balanced with crisp acidity.",France
5297,US,"Far too much sugary sweetness mars this Chardonnay. The peach, pear and tropical fruit flavors are well-oaked, adding caramel candy to the jelly flavors.",US
5298,US,"The underlying fruit on this unoaked Chardonnay doesn't need the richness of barrels in order to satisfy. Its flavors are enormously rich and ripe, with notes of tropical fruits, oranges, vanilla and spices. Interestingly, it's also much higher in alcohol than Foxen's oaked Chardonnays, giving it an almost dessert wine headiness.",US
5299,US,"Made in a food-friendly fashion, this Chard is dry, acidic and minerally. It was obviously picked at lower ripeness, but still shows a warm core of pineapples and green apples. Quite a nice wine for Chardonnay fans to drink with roasted chicken, fleshy fish, or even a white meat such as pork.",US
5300,US,"There's a nice Chardonnay down underneath all the oak, but it's hard to find below the buttered toast and caramel richness. It would be nice to taste an unoaked version, to appreciate the acidity and pineapple fruit.",US
5301,US,This crisp Chardonnay has a disjointedness about it. Its aroma and flavor is most akin to Lemonheads candy.,US
5302,US,"Sweet in smoky oak, with sweet cream flavors, this pleasant Chardonnay is rich in pineapples. Yet it's dry, with a minerally tang and fine acidity. Drink now.",US
5303,US,"The wine brims with pineapples, Asian pears and papayas, dusted with every spice in your pantry. It's bone dry, with a crisp bite of acidity. A touch of oak and lees gives it a rich edge of cream and buttered toast.",US
5304,US,"Very ripe and bright in acidity, with clean, vibrant flavors of Meyer lemon custard, Key lime pie, vanilla sorbet and crème brûlée flavors. Could be more elegant, but it's certainly not shy.",US
5305,US,"This high-acid Chardonnay has a prickly mouthfeel. It tastes considerably more tart than almost anything out there, which at least makes it different. Other than that, it offers fairly standard flavors of peaches, citrus fruits and pears, with oak elaborations.",US
5306,US,"A big, bold, bright and spicy Chardonnay. You'll hardly miss the presence of oak, it's so rich in fruit. Floods the mouth with oranges, pineapples, lemons, limes and minerals, with crisp acidity.",US
5307,US,"They pulled out all the stops on this white Burgundy-inspired Chard. It tastes quite leesy, with a Champagne-like yeastiness riding over the tropical fruit and oaky, caramelized flavors. Complex and intriguing, this unfined, unfiltered Chard should drink well for the next few years.",US
5308,US,"Just beautiful and oh, so refreshing. The cool vintage has resulted in a high-acid wine of enormous fruit, bursting with intense, classic Edna Valley flavors of limes, kiwis, Meyer lemons, honeysuckle and minerals. The vanilla spice and creamy smoke have got to come from the terroir, because the wine never saw a splinter of oak.",US
5309,US,"Extracted and oaky, this will appeal to those who enjoy the popular style. It's strong in buttered toast and butterscotch flavors, with a pineapple jam note.",US
5310,US,"A good Chardonnay to serve at parties, this shows plenty of oak-driven vanilla and toast flavors that ride high over the seemingly sweet note of pineapple candy. It will satisfy lots of Chardophiles, at an affordable price.",US
5311,US,"Fruity and oaky, this Chardonnay is made in the modern California style of immediate palate appeal. It's not especially complex or ageworthy, but has crowd-pleasing flavors of pineapple tart, crème brûlée and vanilla cookies.",US
5312,US,"This is from 30-year-old Wente clone vines, a crisply elegant, almost all stainless-fermented Chardonnay with a tight structure, underlying minerality and a zesty, lime-inflected flavor.",France
5313,US,"The word No refers to no oak and no malolactic fermentation. The wine is sharp in acids and totally dry, but with super-ripe flavors of pineapple, pear, peach and green apple marmalade. Very clean and mouth-cleansing.",US
5314,US,"New oak dominates the aromas and flavors, with buttered toast, buttered popcorn and caramel overwhelming the underlying fruit, which suggests pineapples and green apples. Although the wine is dry and acidity is fine, the fruit lacks the richness to support the oak.",US
5315,US,"Gets the Chardonnay job done at a fair price. With a touch of smoky oak, the wine shows ripe flavors of peaches, pears and nectarines, and finishes clean and dry.",US
5316,US,"The new oak really sticks out on this Chardonnay. It's toothpicky, with strong char and woodsap flavors that seem to overpower a nice, fruity wine underneath.",US
5317,US,"With its pear, apple, pineapple and oaky flavors, this Chard shows a good balance of crisp, cool-climate acidity. It's a little raw on the finish.",US
5318,US,"With its crisp spine of acidity, this wine clearly comes from a cool climate. The flavors show long hang-time notes of ripe pineapples and pears. There's too much oak for balance, given the dominating blast of caramel, but the wine will appeal to many for the price.",US
5319,US,"This is a barrel selection from the winery's Sleepy Hollow Vineyard and is one of the most concentrated Chardonnays in California. Has the honeyed richness of a botrytized wine, but is absolutely dry. Tastes like an apricot and pineapple tart, with seasonings of nutmeg, cinnamon, and the smoky, nutty pie crust. Very few California Chardonnays need time, but this one does. Stash until late 2008, but this powerhouse should gradually peak over a decade.",US
5320,US,"Superripe in fruit and superoaky, this is a big, lush, powerful Chardonnay, but for all the size, it maintains balance and elegance. Potent in smoky, vanilla-accented pineapple brûlée, exotic date and stony mineral flavors, it shows the crisp acidity the vineyard is known for, and finishes dry and spicy.",US
5321,US,"An excellent Finger Lakes pick, it's redolent with aromas of sweet apples and guava balanced with fresh-cut herbs and grass. The dry, full-bodied palate is rich and unctuous but freshened by a tart gooseberry and green plum acidity and a gravelly minerality in the finish.",US
5322,US,"Hints of smoke and toast lace the lush tropical fruit aromas on this dry wine. Highlighted by fresh apple and pear flavors with a pretty floral undertone, it finishes with a touch of tart yogurt cream on the palate.",US
5323,US,"A brisk, likeable Chardonnay. It shows ripe flavors of pineapples, peaches, lemons and sweet limes, accented with crisp coastal acidity. A hint of oak adds pleasant notes of buttered toast and vanilla.",US
5324,US,"Juicy acids and rich flavors of limes, green melons, kiwi and papayas star in this dry, unoaked Chard. The acidity gives the wine an exceptionally clean, vibrant mouthfeel.",US
5325,US,"An everyday Chardonnay, this has buttered toast, butterscotch candy and pineapple flavors. It's clean and brisk in acidity.",US
5326,US,"A little too soft and sweet for balance, with flavors like the melted filling of pineapple tart, lemon meringue pie and vanilla custard. Alcohol adds a nice, balancing burn.",US
5327,US,"A lean, crisp, herbal Chardonnay. Lacks richness, but the structure is dry and elegant. Shows tobacco, sage, cedar and citrus fruit flavors.",US
5328,US,"Ripe and fruity, this is a Chardonnay that will appeal to fans of the modern style. Brims with pineapples, lemons, limes and green apples, with a touch of vanilla cream.",US
5329,US,"A rich, fruity Chardonnay with lots of flavor and bright, mouthwatering acidity. Made sur lie, but with no oak, it has yeasty notes accenting pineapples, Asian pears, green apples, honeysuckle, cinnamon and vanilla.",US
5330,US,"Oak is the star of this Chard, to judge by the butterscotch and spicy caramel flavors that take center stage. Somewhere in there is a dessert-like pear compote, but the oak, or maybe it's the char level, really does seem too strong.",US
5331,US,"Here's a nice everyday Chardonnay. That means it shows good varietal character, with peach, pear, apple and smoky oak flavors, but is just a little rough around the edges.",US
5332,US,"The oak really dominates this wine. It tastes sweet and sappy and caramelly. Underneath it is a dry, crisp wine, with pear, pineapple and red apple flavors.",US
5333,US,"A worthy followup to the '05, possibly even richer and more balanced. Shows wonderfully crisp, mouthwatering acidity framing fruit that's so pure, it's like the essence of pineapples, mangoes, limes and green apples. Lots of oak is here, too, and the smoky, spicy vanillins add just the right touch.",US
5334,US,"Captures the essence of Russian River Chard with its crisp acids that boost and brighten an explosion of taste. The tropical fruit and spice flavors are enriched by toasty oak, while sur lie aging adds a creaminess to the texture of this deliciously dry wine.",US
5335,US,"Dry and crisp and with some complexity. The oak is 50% new and very evident in the smoky caramel, while the fruit veers toward peaches and pineapples. As is often the case with Napa Chard, there's a sweet, herbal quality. Drink now through 2009.",US
5336,US,"Dryness and herba notes mark this wine. Despite some rich oak influences, it comes down on the mineral and sage side, only vaguely suggesting fruitier notes of pineapples and peaches.",US
5337,US,"Tastes very oaky, with vanilla and caramel flavors dominating the earthy pineapples and green apples. That earthiness shows up in the form of sage-like herbs. Ready now.",US
5338,US,"There's plenty of acid in this tart, sleek Chardonnay, and no obvious flavors from barrel aging or even malolactic fermentation. It's simple, crisp, and tastes of green apples with a hint of cinnamon.",US
5339,US,"The palate impression is of oak, lees and acidity, which give tart vanilla, buttered toast and sour cream flavors to an otherwise simple wine. When the palate searches for fruit, it finds modest pineapples, peaches and green apples.",US
5340,US,"This wine is rich in tropical fruit, pear, green apple and lemon-lime flavors, but dry, with a touch of butterscotchy oak. Shows a deftly clean mouthfeel with fine, coastal acidity.",US
5341,US,"This is a wine that's so young and high in acidity, and so minty green, it's hard to find much to praise. A little oak would have helped fatten it, but the wine is unoaked.",US
5342,US,"Simple and crisp, this Central Coast Chard has ripe, candied flavors of apricots, pears and vanilla, in a creamy smooth texture.",US
5343,US,"Watery and thin in fruit, this dry, acidic wine has only modest peach and citrus flavors, with some oak elaborations.",US
5344,US,"Dry and acidic, with sweet and sour Lifesaver pineapple and lemon candy flavors. Made in an easy-to-like style. Production was 4,500 cases, and the alcohol is a modest 13%.",US
5345,US,"There's a lot going on in this young Chard, suggesting moderate aging to let all the parts meld. The wine, from a southern appellation close to Carneros, is dry and crisp in acids, with peach, green apple and dried herb flavors enhanced by smoky, vanilla-tinged oak. Give it through 2007, and should hold for another five years.",US
5346,US,"This big Chardonnay, which was entirely barrel fermented, is tasting a bit too oaky. It was sourced from the winery's estate Carneros vineyard and shows that appellation's crisp acids, along with bright tropical fruit and spice flavors. But the sweet, charry vanilla and caramel from barrels tends to dominate.",US
5347,US,"Seemingly sweet and simple, this has orange and butterscotch candy flavors.",US
5348,US,"Seemingly overly oaked and manipulated, this is all about buttered toast and buttered popcorn flavors, slathered over a note of pineapple jam.",US
5349,US,"Dry on the finish, but lush in smoky oak and pineapple meringue and custard flavors, this is a rich, flamboyant Chardonnay to drink now.",US
5350,US,"Lemony, light-bodied, bone dry and acidically crisp, its citrus and mineral flavors are easy and elegant, and will play well against shrimp scampi.",US
5351,US,"Strong wood flavors characterize ths wine, minimizing its elegance and complexity. It's heavy in toasty oak, with a coating of smoky, charred caramel covering the underlying pear and apple fruit flavors.",US
5352,US,"Soft and simple, this wine has canned fruit flavors of apricots and peaches, with a sweet-sour finish. At this price, it's fine for big parties where the Chard crowd isn't fussy.",US
5353,US,"There's an herbal undertow to this wine, with suggestions of dill and sage to the pineapples, green apples and buttercream. It's also soft, lacking the clean vibrancy that a rich Chardonnay requires. Drink now.",US
5354,US,"A good, rich Chardonnay that satisfies fans of oaky, ripe bottlings. Brims with pineapple, peach, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors, brightened with crisp acidity.",US
5355,US,"Bone dry and hard in acidity, this is an austere Chardonnay that lacks richness, and hopes to trade on elegance. It has modest pineapple flavors, touched with smoky oak and lees. Defines a low-alcohol, minerally approach. Drink now.",US
5356,US,"Barrel-fermented and aged on the lees, this Burgundian-style Chard is creamy and rich in ripe tropical fruit flavors and new oak. It's a big wine, forward in pineapple and mango flavors that are honey-ripe and crisp.",US
5357,US,"Polished and sophisticated, with lush green apple, pineapple, buttered toast and cinnamon flavors. Likeable for its balance and sheer drinkability.",US
5358,US,"There's lots of acidity in this young wine, which gives it a slightly minty, prickly feeling that actually adds to its food-friendliness. With pineapple, green apple, spice and smoky oak flavors, it finishes thoroughly dry. Easy to find, with 30,000 case production.",US
5359,US,"Simple and seemingly sweet, this Chardonnay has apricot jam flavors.",US
5360,US,"If there's any oak on this wine, it doesn't show. Instead, it brims with ripe, pure flavors of pineapples, kiwi fruit, limes and cinnamon spice. Crisp and bright.",US
5361,US,"Oaky and ripe, this Chardonnay shows barrel-inspired vanilla and buttered toast flavors that enrich the pineapples and apples. A touch of Gewurztraminer lifts it into floral and lychee territory.",US
5362,US,"Made in the California style, with very ripe pineapple and apple fruit, elaborated by French oak barrels, malolactic fermentation and sur lie aging. The result will appeal to many, even if it's a bit obvious and direct.",US
5363,US,"Tastes too oaky, with overwhelming smoky caramel, vanilla extract and buttered toast notes that swamp the underlying pineapples and peaches. In this case, you're better off with Gainey's regular 2007 Chard, which costs a lot less.",US
5364,US,"Lockwood's lost a lot of steam over the years. This '06 Chard is thin and watery, with just a squirt of lemon and lime flavor.",US
5365,US,"This very expensive release is one of the rare examples of Chardonnay that absolutely requires bottle age. Dry and leesy now, with a mineral compactness, it shows a rich core of baked peach, spiced apple, butterscotch and smoky honey. As it warms in the glass, it develops great flavor and textural complexities. Should come into its own by 2009, and improve for many years after.",US
5366,US,"This takes ripe fruit and oak influence to the limits, with powerful flavors of buttered toast, pineapple, orange jam and vanilla-cream. This defines the flashy style of California Chardonnay, with a honeyed finish.",US
5367,US,"Young and yeasty, this is a style best consumed early. It refreshes like a light beer, quick and clean, with bracing acidity, but not much in the way of fruit.",US
5368,US,"Easily the best Chardonnay in California at this price. Shows creamy, vibrant flavors of pineapples, green apples, buttered toast and buttered popcorn, cleansed with a scour of acidity. From veteran négociant Ceccheti.",US
5369,US,"Fresh apples with hints of butterscotch, toast and smoke perfume this lovely Chardonnay. While a tad short in concentration, this medium-bodied wine is wonderfully fresh and clean on the palate, with beautifully balanced oak and bright acidity on the finish.",US
5370,US,"The cold and fog actually helped this Chardonnay, which achieves a remarkable delicacy and tartness despite the power of its fruit. Really remarkable for the flood of golden mango, Asian pear and Key lime pie richness, which is grounded by a firm minerality. Oak influence and aging on the lees lend the perfect touches of smoky, buttered toast and zesty creaminess to this dry, polished wine. A mere 587 cases were produced.",US
5371,US,"A spectacular Chardonnay—this is dazzingly beautiful and mesmerizing in its appeal. The complexity of flavor stuns, offering tiers of pineapples, oranges, green apples and golden mangoes. Then the oaky influences appear in the form of buttered toast and caramel, with a suggestion of honey. The finish is dry and crisp in acidity.",US

5375,US,"Oaky, fat and slightly sweet, with creamy flavors of pineapples, buttered popcorn and vanilla. A good approximation of a Burgundian-style California Chardonnay at a fair price.",US
5376,US,"Several factors go into making this Chardonnay as extraordinary as it is. One is Carneros itself, which produces vibrant, crisp, fruit-filled grapes. Second is the Shafer approach of fermenting the wine in both stainless steel and oak barrels, giving a complexity of textures and brightnesses. The use of natural or wild yeasts may also contribute to complexity, while a firm decision against malolactic fermentation preserves vital acidity. The result is a compelling, layered wine whose tropical fruit, mineral, buttered toast and creme brulée flavors are in near-perfect harmony and balance.",US
5377,US,"Lush enough to drink now, with decanting, but this powerfully ripe Chard will benefit from limited aging. It's explosive in oak-infused pineapple, papaya, peach, green apple and Asian spice flavors, but right now the oak is not integrated with the fruit, making for a disjointed quality. Give it until mid-2008, and for a couple years after.",US
5378,US,"Dry, creamy and crisp in acidity, this has rich pineapple, lemon, lime and buttered toast flavors. It's easy to drink and enjoy.",US
5379,US,"A rather simple Chardonnay made in the modern style, with lots of flamboyance and flash, but not much subtlety. Strong and rich in pineapple and peach jam flavors, it's brightened with zesty acidity.",US
5380,US,"Scents of salted caramels, smoke and apple blossom make this wonderfully enticing. It's a straightforward, easygoing wine, but highlighted by fresh apple and pear notes that melt into richer, rounder flavors of nuts and cream.",US

5382,US,"Here's a county-appellated Chardonnay that shows how the art of blending can produce a really nice Chardonnay at a fair price. It shows bracing, cool-climate acidity and is quite dry, with a rich spicing of oak that gives a vanilla-cream smokiness to the peach and pineapple fruit.",US
5383,US,"Enormous in jammy apricot, peach, pineapple, Asian spice and sweet charred oak vanillins, this Burgundy-inspired Chard is a little sweet. But it provides enough acidity for balanced structure.",US
5384,US,"One word describes this Chardonnay: fabulous. It's really everything a California Chardonnay can deliver. Ripe tropical fruit, pear, green apple and honey flavors are wrapped into buttery, smoky oak. The richness is brightened by crisp acidity and a touch of minerals, showing its pedigree with every nuance. Drink soon, to enjoy its youthful beauty.",US
5385,US,"Simply astonishing for its price, this toasty, rich wine matches ripe flavors of peach, red apple and light tropical fruit. Thick, juicy, and seductive, it finishes with a lick of butterscotch.",US
5386,US,"Vintner Carr follows up on his great 2008 Reserve with this delicious bottling. In California, it's usually a cinch to get fruit this ripe and tropical, and easy to plaster on lots of new oak. What's hard is to fuse the elements seamlessly. This wine does, offering waves of Chardonnay opulence. It may have a touch of botrytis, but that's in its favor.",US
5387,US,"Lime-peel acidity marks this bone-dry, tart wine. The other flavors include steely minerals, pineapple crème brûlée and buttered toast. Drink now.",US
5388,US,"This Chardonnay has depth, starting with its unfolding nose of ripe Chardonnay fruit, minerals, hazelnut and citrus. The palate offers flavors of pear, citrus and grapefruit, its character refreshing and fruity but somewhat complex. An impressive white that can handle richer dishes.",France
5389,US,"Brisk and sprightly, with keen acidity that makes the mouth water. The basic flavors suggest ripe Meyer lemons, pineapples, Key lime pie, spicy Asian pear, vanilla and honeysuckle. A good, rich crowd pleaser at an affordable price.",US
5390,US,"Crisply acidic and very dry, with modest pineapple, lime and mineral flavors and a touch of leesy sourness wrapped into a cream mouthfeel. Drink now.",US
5391,US,"This is aromatic and enchanting, loaded with very pretty scents of citrus blossom and lime. The fruit blends sweet apple, lemon/lime and juicy white peach. It's a luscious Chardonnay that relies on the perfectly ripened fruit to deliver the flavors, and succeeds beautifully. All Dijon clones, with a splash of Viognier lifting up the nose.",US
5392,US,"Gallo has held this Chard more than 4 years before release; the reason may be an acidic tightness that still dominates the wine. It's deep in mineral-infused apricot and quince fruit. The barrel regimen consisted of 100% new oak. It's a big, absolutely dry, almost rasping wine, and may be one of those rare California Chards capable of aging. See what it does after 2008.",US
5393,US,"Sweet and sour, with candied pineapple and butterscotch flavors as well as brisk acidity, leading to a sugary finish. Okay as an everyday Chardonnay.",US

5396,US,"This is a pleasurable but ultimately simple wine, crisp and appealing in rather sweet orange, pineapple and apple fruit juice flavors.",US
5397,US,"Dry, acidic and earthy, lacking the richness you want in a fine Chardonnay. Could almost be a Pinot Grigio, with its crisp citrus and mineral flavors.",US
5398,US,"Lots of rich pineapple, buttered toast, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors in this Chard. It's made in an uncomplicated style to appeal to consumers who have made this kind of Chardonnay the most popular wine in America.",US
5399,US,"Buttered toast and caramel corn dominate this Chardonnay, which also features ripe pineapple and golden mango flavors. It's made in the popular style of ripe, oaky fruitiness.",US
5400,US,"Ripe, oaky and somewhat common. Shows all the bells and whistles of a Burgundian-style Chardonnay, with vanilla cream, pineapple tart and buttered toast flavors. But it's too soft for balance, and lacks complexity.",US
5401,US,"Oaky and dull, with flavors of sweetened pineapple juice that are heavily plastered with caramel and buttered popcorn. Needs greater restraint and subtlety.",US
5402,US,"A brilliant Chardonnay. It's powerful and ripe in fruit, offering a blast of pineapple, green apple, Key lime pie and Meyer lemon tart flavors, accented with the buttered toast of oak. As intense as the fruit is, it's balanced by keen acidity and a stony minerality. Defines the elegant, opulent Russian River style.",US
5403,US,"Enormously ripe and rich—this is honeyed, with citrus and tropical fruit flavors. It's creamy, too, with a butterscotch accent. The magic comes on the finish with a swirl of acidity and dry mineral. Decadent but never cloying, this defines the ripe California style.",US

5410,US,"A beautiful wine, this is rich in citrus, tropical fruit and green apple flavors, with a smoky jacket of oak. The acids and tannins lift it above the ordinary, as does a stony minerality that tastes of the soil.",US
5411,US,"This is arguably Firestone's best Chardonnay in many years—maybe ever. It's rich, creamy and powerful in Chardonnay flavor, flooding the mouth with flavors of ripe tropical fruit, apricot, buttered toast, vanilla cream and spice.",US

5414,US,"This winery has a good track record for producing rich, opulent Chardonnays. The cool 2010 vintage was beneficial, yielding a low alcohol wine with extraordinarily rich tropical fruit flavors and bright, graceful acidity. It saw a majority of new French oak, lending it a note of buttered toast, but the underlying wine is so big, it easily handles that weight.",US
5415,US,"Oak dominates this Chardonnay, with buttered toast and butterscotch notes offering an immediate impact. Underneath the oak tones are very rich, opulent flavors of pineapple and orange jam and lime tart. It's a bit jumbled now, but this may be a Chardonnay that can take some cellaring. Give it 3–4 years.",US
5416,US,"Beautiful, classic Green Valley Chardonnay, this shows bright, mouthwatering acidity and a steely minerality that make it savory and elegant. But there's also a deep, flavorful core of green apple butter, pineapple jam and orange-mango juice. Oak and lees aging lend a creamy, sourdough richness. Drink now.",US
5417,US,"Fogarty's basic '05 Chard shows an exciting crispness and minerality that, good as it is, makes you long for the single-vineyard bottlings to come. There's an elegant angularity to the wine despite the succulent pineapples, kiwis and new oak, and a brisk acidity that makes it finish vibrantly clean.",US
5418,US,"The 2006 Chardonnay is another excellent bottle from this Oregon négociant, offering ripe and luscious fruit flavors of pear, apple, quince and kiwi.

5427,US,"The vineyard is on Frei Road, which is in the cooler, southern part of the appellation, and this wine shows how well a good vintage can ripen the grapes into tropical fruit directions while still maintaining vibrant acidity.

5455,US,"The aroma suggests a ton of oak, and that impression carries over to the flavors. Butterscotch, buttered toast, caramel, crème brûlée, they're all tasty, but you don't want them to dominate, and here, they do. The underlying flavors of pineapples are swamped.",US

5480,US,"An extraordinary Chardonnay whose complicated richness is balanced with tight acidity and a firm grounding of stony minerals.

5491,US,"Shows the bright, tart acidity of this fine coastal region, with signature flavors of pineapples, figs, dates, limes and vanilla. But finishes too sweet in white sugar to earn a higher score.",US
5492,US,"This elegant blend of stainless- and barrel-aged lots captures the fresh fruit flavors of red apples, kiwi and lime, letting just a hint of barrel toast creep into the finish. It's leesy and bracing, finished at 14.8% alcohol but tasting much lighter.",US

5499,US,"The underlying fruit smacks of lemon curd, peach pie and kumquats, with a keen, cold minerality. Well-charred oak and lees contribute the richest notes of butterscotch, vanilla and toast. Dry, crisp and elegant, this is one of the best Dry Creek Valley Chards I've ever tasted, but it's still not in the league of the best cool-climate bottlings.",US
5500,US,"There's a minerality to this Chard that makes it bracing, although it also shows the opulence of Fogarty's other '04s. A tang of gunmetal undergirds the tropical fruit and vanilla custard flavors that are wrapped into a creamy texture. Almost begs for shrimp, lobster, crab, the more richly prepared, the better.",US
5501,US,"Vine Ciff has become one of the most successful producers of Chardonnay in Napa Valley. The reason why, besides sourcing great grapes, is balance. Everything works in this wine, which is a mélange of rich tropical fruit, crisp acidity, a creamy texture, and sweet wood tannins.",US
5502,US,"Here's a wonderfully balanced Chardonnay. It's rich, ripe and oaky, with crisp cool-climate acidity boosting the pineapple and papaya fruit, but there's also a mineral, diesel note throughout that adds complexing interest and firmness. Should hold for five years.",US
5503,US,"A few years in the bottle are beginning to age this charming Chardonnay, although its brisk acidity and minerality remain. The pear, guava, nectarine and tangerine flavors are just starting to pick up a dried fruit character. Complex and savory, it's a very fine wine to drink now.",US

5508,US,"This is the most citrusy of Testarossa's '07 Chards, brimming with Meyer lemon, lime and pineapple flavors. Smooth, smoky oak and lees add complex layers of butter, cream and tart yeastiness. Brilliant but immature, the wine should come into its own after 2009.",US
5509,US,"Native yeast, weekly batinage (lees stirring) in 50% new barrels, and, most importantly, a superb vineyard—Stillwater Creek—make for the best Chardonnay yet from Sparkman.

This is an inaugural vintage from the winery.",US

5527,US,"The idea here was to make a white Burgundy-style Chardonnay with lots of oak. But the new oak is so strong that it overshadows what's actually a pretty nice wine underneath. You have to dive down through an ocean of smoky char, woody vanilla and sweet woodsap to find the basic peach and pineapple flavors.",US

5558,US,"A racy, citric undertone and spicy toast beckon on this fun, fresh wine from New York. On the palate, there's an impressive roundness and a touch of butter on the tongue, but a very pretty wave of flowers, minerality and zip keep it light.",US
5559,US,"An awesome Chardonnay. Explodes in the mouth with massive pineapple, crème brûlée, apricot jam and new oak flavors that finish thoroughly dry. For all the richness, there's a near-perfect balance of acidity, and a mineral undertow that grounds the wine, providing vitality and life. Brilliant now and through 2013.",US
5560,US,"Here's a big, impressive Chardonnay. It's massive in new oak, offering waves of vanilla, buttered toast and caramelized flavors. Yet the underlying pineapple, pear and tropical fruit flavors are big enough to easily support that elaborate coating. Thoroughly delicious and compelling, a wine to drink now and through 2013.",US
5561,US,"Oaky and ripe, with powerful tropical pineapple, kumquat, mineral and floral aromas and flavors. New oak adds smoke, vanilla and char. The bottom line is of a flavorful, acidic and elegant Chard with a lingering, spicy finish.",US
5562,US,"A crisp, fresh, medium-bodied Chardonnay, this is toasty and nutty but not overly vanilla-scented. Grilled peach and buttered sweet corn notes pick up citrus overtones that finish long and mouthwatering.",US
5563,US,"Earthy and minerally, an austere Chard by today's standards, with a thyme and tobacco edge to the modest peach fruit. My bias is for either impossibly rich, oaky Chards or sleek, fruity, unoaked ones. This falls between those goal posts.",US
5564,US,"Simple and fruity, this everyday Chard has peach, pineapple and spice flavors. The taste of smoky oak shows up on the finish.",US
5565,US,"There's a decent wine here, crisp and ripe in pineapple flavor, but it's been buried under so much oak, it's practically invisible. The wine reeks of woodsap and charred barrels, dominated by a sweet vanilla taste.",US
5566,US,"Simple and too oaky, with peach, pineapple, vanilla cream and buttered toast flavors. The toast overwhelms everything.",US
5567,US,"This outstanding wine is crisp and delicious, absolutely loaded with stone fruits, fresh-cut pineapple, and juicy citrus.",US
5568,US,"The best Hogue Chardonnay in years, this 2007 reserve bottling showcases fully ripened apple, peach and melon fruit flavors in a luscious wrapping of new oak. Butterscotch and a whisp of vanilla carry through the seductive finish.",US
5569,US,"Another success from this vineyard, which supplies Chardonnay to some of the best producers in the state. Perfect structure, matching acid and mineral to citrus fruit, juice and rind. Fragrant, textural and deep.",US
5570,US,"This isn't one of those rich, gooey Chardonnays that dazzle some people. But it's a crisp, minerally wine that shows great elegance and Chablis-like sophistication. Dry and crisp, it shows complex flavors of tart green apples and pears, with subtle influences of smoky oak.",US
5571,US,"Ultrarich and oaky, with vanilla, buttered toast, caramel and smoky flavors accenting the underlying pineapple, guava, nectarine and pear fruits. This opulent wine will meld and become mellow in another 2–3 years.",US
5572,US,"For the first time the fruit was sourced from Conner Lee vineyard old vines. It's a glorious wine, a near-perfect mix of citrus and stone, kissed with honey and dust, lightly buttery. Fermented mostly with native yeast, this is one of the best Washington Chardonnays of a very good vintage.",US
5573,US,"Earthy, like some Napa Chards, with a sage and thyme edge to the pear and peach fruit. The wine also is a little soft. But there's an interesting minerality. Could develop bottle complexity over the next few years.",US
5574,US,"A round, full character with ample layers of creamy spice and balanced acid recommend this elegant, more traditional Chardonnay from the Finger Lakes. The mouthfeel is full but poised, and the finish long.",US
5575,US,"This is a bit fat and forward, with flavors of tropical fruit and banana, and a light dusting of cocoa, cinnamon and butterscotch. It's a tasty wine to drink up as soon as possible.",US
5576,US,"Showing lemon zest and yellow apricot flavors, this bone-dry Chard has serious underpinnings of minerals. It's reminiscent of a good French Chablis, and may require time in the cellar.",US
5577,US,"This is easily the greatest of Foxen's new Chardonnays. It show the dryness and crisp acidity of the other bottlings, but is enormously rich and complex in oak-inspired pineapple, peach, crème brûlée, buttered toast, honey and mineral flavors. Decant for a while to let it mellow, and it should develop bottle complexity through 2014.",US
5578,US,"Brilliantly crisp and lushly creamy and honeyed, just a beautiful Chardonnay that offers decadence and sheer deliciousness. Massive in grilled pineapples, green apples, ripe nectarines and butterscotch, brightened with mouthwatering acidity. A joy to drink.",US
5579,US,"Farrell's 2007 lineup of Chardonnays is a triumph, and this Starr Ridge is among their best. It's a big wine, rich in tropical fruit, peach, green apple, mineral and oak flavors that completely satisfy now. Yet there's an acidic urgency that suggests aging for up to six years, by which time the wine should achieve a honeyed creaminess.",US
5580,US,"Couldn't be riper or more powerful in flavor, a Chard that just detonates with explosive pineapple tart filling, honey, vanilla and crème brûlée. Could use a bit of subtlety, but fans of pure Chardonnay flavor will be delighted.",US
5581,US,"Vineyard sources for the winery's reserve tier of Chardonnay have bounced around over the years. Now, it's Russian River, but this Chard is far from Ferrari-Carano's best. It has decent peach and apple fruit, but with a thin brittleness inappropriate for this price, and all that new oak doesn't really help.",US
5582,US,"Simple and fruity, this Chard has flavors of canned apricots and peaches, finished with notes of charry oak. It's a soft wine, and a little bit sweet, but it's pleasant and affordable.",US
5583,US,"Your basic inexpensive California Chard: fruity, creamy and light, with pleasant peach, pineapple and apricot flavors finished with a touch of spicy oak.",US
5584,US,"Citrus and honeydew fruit flavors anchor this unoaked Chardonnay. It has a wonderful leesy texture that enlivens the palate, giving the impression of limestone, or at least lime pulp. Flavors linger, clean and utterly refreshing.",US
5585,US,"Marked by zesty acidity and dryness, this Chard shows long hangtime, ripe flavors of pineapples, lemons and sweet green apples. Minerality grounds the fruit, making the wine savory and clean. Gets better as it warms in the glass, a very good sign.",US
5586,US,"Produced from this famous cool-climate vineyard, the wine is zesty in acidity and dry, but enormously rich and impressive in pineapple and pear flavors, with a distinct minerality that makes it feel drier and earthier. It's a strong wine, but subtle. Drink now, but not too cold.",US
5587,US,"Banana fruit flavors are somewhat mitigated by old vine character and the inherent acidity of Yakima Valley grapes. There's a green streak suggesting not quite ripe banana and papaya—not a bad thing—along with fresh baked bread, vanilla and almond.",US
5588,US,"Way too sweet, this tastes like a couple spoons of white sugar were added to a wine that already had good pineapple flavors.",US
5589,US,"Pricey for what you get, namely an everyday Chard with ripe fruit flavors and a simple structure. The oak is unnaturally heavy and plastered on, like an eccentric overlay of makeup.",US
5590,US,"Shows a welcome return to form after the '06. This time, the butterscotchy oak plays a supporting role, allowing the pineapple, pear, guava and mineral flavors to shine. Beautiful and elegant.",US
5591,US,"The vineyard is the source of fantastic Pinot Noirs and Chardonnays for several wineries, and Barnett scores big points with this lush, rich but balanced wine. It's tremendous in pineapple, pear, green apple and oaky vanilla flavors, but beautifully balanced with firm acidity. Represents an impressive step forward for this bottling.",US
5592,US,"A beautiful Chardonnay with so much class and elegance, it's a bargain at this price. Shows lush flavors of pineapple crème brûlée, Meyer lemon custard and vanilla sorbet, balanced with crisp acidity and a fine touch of smoky oak. Perfect with shellfish.",US
5593,US,"A lovely Chardonnay, dry, elegant and minerally. Displays real control, with the pineapple, lemondrop candy, apricot and oak flavors balanced by crisp acidity. Easily as good as Chards costing far more, which makes it a value.",US
5594,US,"This is a good example of what Finger Lakes Chards can offer: assertive, full-flavored Chardonnay flavors and layers of spice edged by a clean minerality. Balanced and offering a supple mouthfeel, the wine is both food friendly and elegant.",US
5595,US,"Luscious fruit and toast aromas are the beginning of this fun wine from Fox Run. On the palate, it offers good Chardonnay flavors and a round, supple mouthfeel. It's not terribly complex but is flavorful and has dimension.",US
5596,US,"Very high in acidity, with a mouth-cleansing scour, this Chard carries lemon, lime, pineapple and floral notes. It has a honeyed creaminess that gives body and fatness to the structure.",US
5597,US,"A nice Russian River Chard, firm in acidic minerals, with an edge of dried herbs and wood char to the pineapple, green apple and cream caramel flavors.",US
5598,US,"The winery calls this unoaked Chardonnay “Homage to Chablis,” presumably because it's a high-acid, low alcohol wine whose main flavors are of minerals, with subtle elements of citrus zest and pear. It's a connoisseurs' wine that requires some understanding to appreciate. Sommeliers will love it, but it's hard to find. Only 120 cases produced.",US
5599,US,"You could enjoy this Chardonnay now, because it has lush pineapple, pear and mineral flavors, and smoky oak adds delicious notes of vanilla, honey and buttered toast. Yet it's a tight wine, with searing acidity. One of the few California Chardonnays that needs age, it will come into its own after 2012.",US
5600,US,"Nutty and melon-scented, this is a medium-bodied Chardonnay with distinct tangerine and spice components Lohr attributes to the “Muscat clone” used in this wine. Finishes with a flourish of buttery richness. This would pair beautifully with cold crab.",US
5601,US,"Has aromas of buttered toast and peaches a nd cream, but once it the mouth, it turns kind of harsh, with lemon skin and puckery acidity. There's a lot of new oak, which is nice, but it's out of balance with the underlying thinness of the fruit.",US
5602,US,"Soft and simple, with one-dimensional Chardonnay flavors of canned peaches. The winemaking notes emphasize that the wine has not undergone malolactic fermentation. Good thing, because there's almost no discernible acidity.",US
5603,US,"Damaris is a wine whose sourcing keeps shifting, from Bien Nacido to Sonoma County. Now it's Sonoma Valley. The wine is dominated by oak, all vanilla and char, but isn't very interesting down below. The flavors are citrusy, just not big enough for a wine with this famous a name.",US
5604,US,"Everyday Chard, dry and balanced, with crisp acidity, some creaminess and a touch of new oak barrel to the peaches and citrus. Could be richer and longer in flavor, though.",US
5605,US,"A very pleasant Chardonnay that's lifted above the ordinary by a brisk, dry minerality. Orange, lemon and pear fruit stars, with a suggestion of toast and complicated notes of anise, vanilla and cream.",US
5606,US,"Labeled Columbia Valley, but actually from Wahluke Slope fruit, this refreshing, tart take on Chardonnay offers a palate-cleansing mix of cucumber, melon and apple-flavored fruit. Crisp acids and a phenolic kick to the finish make this a super food wine.",US
5607,US,"A very fine Chard, complex and layered, and quite dry. Acidity makes the tangerine, kumquat, ripe yellow pear, roasted pineapple and oaky, crème brûlée flavors really come alive. After you swallow, the wine leaves behind a delicious impression.",US
5608,US,"Rich and oaky, with lavish flavors of vanilla custard, smoky meringue and créme brulée. The fruit consists of ripe pineapples and Meyer lemons.",US
5609,US,"This is all Sundance vineyard, beautifully executed. It's got a ton of character, intensity, and brilliant, bright fruit. The acids are natural and flavors run through the citrus spectrum, from lime to pineapple, with great persistence.",US
5610,US,"Big and bold, a ripe, oaky Chardonnay that needs some time in the cellar to come together. Offers tiers of apricot, pear, peach and nectarine flavors, with a stony minerality and crisp acidity that makes the mouth water. Bone dry and complex, this Chablisian Chardonnay will blossom some time in 2010.",US
5611,US,"A lush expression of buttered brioche, Key lime, toasted nuts and light tropical fruit, nicely woven together. It gains fullness as it breathes and opens up right in the mouth. The finish extends and details beautifully, without relying on superripe fruit or excessive oak.",US
5612,US,"That terrific Santa Rita acidity is there, and the oak regimen tastes very expensive, but the fruit doesn't seem up to the task. It's a pretty good wine, with pineapples, dates, crème brûlée and spices, but there should be greater richness and complexity from this esteemed vineyard.",US
5613,US,"Pronounced minerality and fresh, bright fruit are balanced nicely in this stylish wine. A touch of spice adds dimension. Pair with poultry dishes.",US
5614,US,"It's all upfront in this direct Chard, with ripe pineapple, yellow apricot and passionfruit flavors that have been generously oaked. Will satisfy fans of big, lush California Chards. Drink now.",US
5615,US,"Frog's Leap's Chards always have a softly herbal earthiness, even though there's plenty of pineapple, green apple, apricot and vanilla oaky flavor. That herbaceousness keeps the wine from soaring.",US
5616,US,"An acidic, bone-dry Chardonnay, brilliant in fruit, that doesn't seem to have been touched by oak. It's so pure in zesty Meyer lemon, lime and kiwi flavors, with a mouthwateringy clean finish.",US
5617,US,"Dry and balanced, this young wine has a steely mineral tang to the fruitier flavors of ripe yellow apricots, tangerines and baked green apples. Oak adds smoky, spicy wood notes. A very nice Chard at a good price.",US
5618,US,"Made in a spare, angular style, this has citrus zest, mineral and pear flavors, brightened by acidity. It's an elegant wine with a creamy, buttery texture.",US
5619,US,"Dramatic and unctuous, displaying Rosemary's usual complexity and intensity. In this fine vintage, the ripe grilled pineapple, peach tart, crème brûlée, buttered toast, honeysuckle and mineral flavors are accompanied by fine, crisp acidity that brightens and lifts the richness. Very rich and elegant. Drink now–2010.",US
5620,US,"Don't let the Washington appellation dissuade you, this is 70% Woodward Canyon estate fruit. Aged in 20% new oak, it's aromatic, a lovely mix of fruits, perfectly assembled. Flavors run from lime to apple, pear to tropical, dusted with toasted hazelnuts and finished with notes of vanilla and caramel.",US
5621,US,"Smoky, creamy and ultrasmooth in vanilla bean sweetness, this is an absolutely delicious Chardonnay. It's so forward in pineapples, peaches, pears, green apples and honey, with lots of buttered toast, but is also crisply balanced in citrusy acidity. A real treat now.",US
5622,US,"Made from a block in the estate vineyard, the Chardonnay shows classic Green Valley acidity and savory flavors of Key lime pie, stony minerals, Asian pears and pineapple brûlée, with a rich coating of smoky oak. For all the opulence, it's totally dry on the finish. Complex and compelling. Drink now–2013 for freshness and vitality.",US
5623,US,"Here's a pull out all the stops, bells and whistles Chard that aims to compete at a high level. Barrel fermented in 80% new oak, aged on the lees and put through full malolactic fermentation, it's rich, creamy, buttery and exotically flavored in opulent toasted barrel and tropical fruits. I personally like this style, but others might find it too oaky.",US
5624,US,"Tropical fruit aromas mingle with toasted oak on the nose of this elegant wine from Finger Lakes pioneer Dr. Frank. On the palate, the wine offers appealing and balanced flavors of creamy vanilla, spice and vibrant, lively fruit, making it an excellent choice for everything from salmon to spicier Asian cuisine.",US
5625,US,"Geyser Peak's Reserve Chards have been pretty good lately, as they learn how to bring balance to grapes that ripen so easily. The '05 is plenty ripe, packed with jammy apricot, tangerine and oaky vanilla custard and butterscotch flavors. It's a rich, exotic wine, with good enough acidity for balance.",US
5626,US,"Shows the dried hay and light tobacco herbalness that sometimes accompany Carneros Chards, with riper notes of pineapples. When the oak kicks it, it brings smoke, buttered toast, toasted coconut and vanilla. This is a very dry wine to have with a wide range of foods.",US
5627,US,"Co-released with the '04, but the wine is tired. It's already showing old flavors, with an earthy, herbal undertow.",US
5628,US,"Seems tired, and even though it's not an old wine, it just lacks zest. It's a simple little Chardonnay with modest peach flavors and a dry earthiness.",US
5629,US,"This is the kind of Chardonnay that divides wine lovers into enemy camps. Old World purists will criticize the candied richness. New World fans will love the toasted marshmallow, caramel corn and buttered toast flavors that rest on a solid foundation of pineapple and green apple fruit.",US
5630,US,"Marked by big, sharp acidity, like biting into a lime, and clean, linear flavors of limes, green apples and pineapples, this bone-dry Chardonnay badly needs food to balance it out. Think of bacon-wrapped grilled shrimp, or a spicy Ahi tuna tartare dish.",US
5631,US,"Rich and oaky, with brisk acidity framing delicious flavors of pineapple custard, buttered toast and crème brûlée. Elegant and impressive for drinking now.",US
5632,US,"H3 is Columbia Crest's line of wines from the Horse Heaven Hills AVA—the winery's home turf—and the wines seem to have a bit more cut and flair than the slightly less expensive Columbia Valley bottlings. Here you will find a more complex blend of fruits—starfruit, apple, melon and a hint of banana—and less focus on butter and toast. In other words, more of a food and sipping wine.",US
5633,US,"Made in a softly flamboyant style, with massive flavors of citrus and tropical fruits, buttered toast, cinnamon and crème brûlée, firmed with stony minerals. Tons of stuffing in this opulent Chardonnay, which was aged in 50% new oak.",US
5634,US,"There's a lot of oak on this Chard, sourced from multiple vineyards, and the barrel influences currently dominate, with the vanilla, butterscotch and caramel flavors many people confuse with the taste of Chardonnay itself. In this case, the underlying pineapple, pear and green apple fruit is ample enough to support all that weight.",US
5635,US,"Ripe, lush and immediately attractive, this Chard offers rich tiers of pineapple custard, pear marmalade, vanilla, buttered toast, toasted coconut and Asian spice flavors. It's a strong, flamboyant wine that calls for equally strong foods, like lobster.",US
5636,US,"Barrel fermented and aged on the lees for almost a year, this is a nutty, slightly oily wine that shows the influence of the barrel, but lacks the fruit density to match it. The 14% alcohol hits the palate with some heat. High-toned and a bit harsh.",US
5637,US,"A very appealing nose of earthy spice starts this successful Chard, and leads into a full, rounded blanket of toasted oak and fruit. There's complexity here without heaviness, and the wine finishes big but pretty. Pair with richer seafood—like crab—or creamy poultry dishes.",US
5638,US,"This is rich and fruity and direct. It appeals for its acid-laced lime, kiwi, passionfruit and pineapple flavors and rich, smoky coat of oak.",US
5639,US,"Firm and minerally, with zippy acids framing oak-touched mango, pear and sautéed banana flavors. Not a big Chard, but an elegant, crisply dry one.",US
5640,US,"Very forward and mouth-filling in pineapples, mangoes, nectarines, guavas and figs. Yet the wine is dry and crisp. Shows flamboyance rather than complexity, and will appeal to fans of this hedonistic style.",US
5641,US,"This is a tremendous, powerful Chardonnay that swamps the mouth with ripe fruit and oak. It detonates with pineapple crème brûlée, peach tart, buttered toast and vanilla flavors, and while it's dry, it has a honey-sweet finish and a crisp, citrus acid tartness. Drink now.",US
5642,US,"A dry, and elegant fruit-forward wine. It was harvested relatively early, at lower brix, resulting in crisp acidity and succulent flavors of tart green apples and kiwis, with a tang of pepper and cinnamon. Delicious.",US
5643,US,"Not a very interesting; a soft, weak wine with aromas and flavors of canned fruits.",US
5644,US,"The promotional material for this wine says it's to celebrate “the indomitable spirit and culture of the Big Easy,” New Orleans. It's not only a bad wine, it's an insult to the victims of Hurricane Katrina, and a cynical attempt to play off the public's sympathy. If Bronco Wine Co., which owns the brand, donated any of the profits to relief efforts, it would be one thing. But they're not. Shame.",US
5645,US,"Four things define this wine. Extraordinarily ripe fruit, high acidity, a terroir-driven minerality, and lots of new French oak. The flavors are of tropical fruits, the ripest white peaches and vanilla cream, baked into spicy pastry crust. The impression is of impossible richness, California Chardonnay at its most opulent, flamboyant limit.",US
5646,US,"Tart and slender, this is deceptive; at first it seems a little thin, but as it opens in the glass into a succulent, well-defined, racy wine with citrus and peach, mineral and herb. It's not delicate, but its muscularity is concealed behind elegant styling.",US
5647,US,"Believe me, you won't miss the oak barrel influence on this wine. It's so good all by itself. Brightened with crisp Monterey acidity and totally dry, it's rich in pineapple, tangerine, Meyer lemon, lime, mineral and vanilla flavors that will satisfy your Chardonnay tooth.",US
5648,US,"This Chard's  acid-laden minerality dominates, tasting of cold metal and wet flint, with undertones of pineapple liqueur, and the finish is dry and oaky. Elegant, it's a Chard to drink with buttery lobster. Should develop interestingly, over the next 8 years.",US
5649,US,"Huge, rich, white Burgundy style Chardonnay. Has a pie-filling fruity richness of pineapples, lemondrop, pears, kiwi fruit and exotic kumquats, balanced with fine, minerally acidity, and wrapped into a buttercream texture. The oak is flamboyant, but perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume. Dazzling and dramatic, from a vineyard that just keeps performing better and better.",US
5650,US,"Guaranteed to please the most discriminating Chardonnay fans for its dry crispness, great structure and endless opulence. Massively complex, offering waves of grilled pineapple, pear, buttered toast and smoky vanilla. The grapes came mainly from Bien Nacido Vineyard, with the balance from Sierra Madre. Only 338 cases produced.",US
5651,US,"Bob Cabral's Chardonnays sometimes get lost in the brilliant glare of his Pinot Noirs, but he has spent years exploring the rich, flamboyant side of the variety, with great success. This bottling represents William Selyem Chardonnay at its best. It's ultra-decadent in apricot and pear flavors, with a strong oak influence, and yet an underlying minerality and fine acidity balance it so that it doesn't tire as you drink. In fact, you want more.",US
5652,US,"Massively rich, with pronounced, sweet, smoky oak flavors and a rich vein of tart, creamy lees highlighting the underlying fruity ripeness. Shows flavors of grilled pineapples, tropical mangoes and pears, balanced with crisp acids. Tremendously delicious and compelling.",US
5653,US,"Amazingly rich, one of the most opulent Chardonnays you can drink now. Just wows the mouth with pineapple, pear, exotic tropical fruit, crème brûlée, vanilla custard, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors that go on and on through the finish. Also shows fine, tart acidity, which provides needed balance. Yes, it's superripe, but this is what California Chardonnay does at its best.",US
5654,US,"Massive, opulent, oozing in pineapple créme brulée, honey, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors. Totally decadent, and fortunately set off with brisk, citrusy acidity. Calling all lobsters, and don't forget the drawn butter. Sheer hedonism in a glass, at a fantastic price.",US
5655,US,"Massively fruity and oaky, this is an atom bomb of a Chardonnay. You either love this style or you hate it. The pineapple tart, apricot, pear, peach, crème brûlée, buttered toast, vanilla cream and cinnamon spice flavors go on and on. Beyond the utter richness is firm acidity and a bracing minerality. Defines California-style decadence, but drink now, as the wine will quickly go downhill.",US
5656,US,"Superrich, ripe and flamboyant, if not particularly subtle. Dazzles for its tsunami of grilled pineapple custard, pear tart, golden mango and Key lime pie richness, accented with sweetly, caramelized oak, and brightened with brisk acidity. A racy, decadent crowd pleaser.",US
5657,US,"Tight, dry and acidic, this Chard is marked by herb and mineral flavors. It is not one of those big, fat, gooey Chards, although it does show elegantly ripe Meyer lemons, buttered toast and spices. Could age for up to five years.",US
5658,US,"Doesn't say so on the label, but the grapes are from Dry Creek Valley. It's a sleek, sophisticated and different sort of Chardonnay, drier and earthier than most, with pleasant pineapple, pear, green apple and herb flavors.",US
5659,US,"This oaky, ripe, fruit-forward Chardonnay will appeal to fans of the California style. It's massive in pineapple jam, lemondrop candy and vanilla crème brûlée flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. A little obvious, but delicious.",US
5660,US,"Tight, taut and lemony, a Chablis-like Chardonnay of extreme dryness and minerality. Shows mouthwatering flavors of flint, Meyer lemons and limes, with a touch of smoky oak. Very fine and elegant, a beautiful Chardonnay that will support, not overwhelm, food.",US
5661,US,"A light floral and toasty nose leads into this clean, slightly racy Chardonnay from New York. There's a touch of sweetness to the wine but it's balanced by good oak and an earthiness to the finish.",US
5662,US,"For lovers of the big California Chardonnays, this wine delivers. Bold aromas of buttery spice lead into full flavors of cream, butter and spice. The wine offers complexity and unfolds nicely on the palate. A white that can handle rich dishes and can age.",US
5663,US,"Here's a likeable Chard, with peach, pear and fig flavors that have a distinctly herbal edge, like dried sage. Turns buttery and vanilla-y on the finish.",US
5664,US,"A little too ripe and oaky for elegance, this is almost dessert-like, in the sweet vanilla, crème brûlée and pineapple jam flavors. Crisp acidity helps to balance.",US
5665,US,"Fresh toast, wooded spice  on the nose is friendly and appealing. On the palate, it works too, with its playful balance of layered spice oak and fresh acidity. The wine will appeal to fans of both oaked and unoaked Chardonnay, and will make a nice addition to the table.",France

5668,US,"This is forward and a bit fat, with softly laid-in fruit flavors of pear, melon and white peach, set against generous, buttery oak. The 2005 seems to have had more acid and weight; this is a lighter, softer vintage, but the wine has been made in the same general style. It's ready to be enjoyed right now.",US
5669,US,"A good, rich, oaky Chardonnay, with intense fruit concentration and elaborate winemaking technique. Shows powerful pineapple, papaya, nectarine and sweet vanilla flavors, with a grounding minerality and adequate acidity for balance. Production was 2,215 cases.",US
5670,US,"This bottling, an extended lees Chardonnay, has been an innovation by the winery. The experiment is augmented by holding the release date back longer than usual. The 2006 vintage was not a great success, but this is an interesting, complex wine that should further develop in the bottle. Marked by the creamy, slightly sour taste of the lees, it has richness added by ripe apple and pineapple fruit and sweet, smoky oak.",US
5671,US,"Shows the richness and complexity of all Testarossa's Chardonnays, with masses of tropical fruit and oak flavors balanced by zesty acidity. But this wine, with a statewide appellation, has a mouthwatering minerality, a zesty tang of steel, that gives the wine extra layers. What a delicious, exciting Chardonnay.",US
5672,US,"This is a really nice Chardonnay. Sebastiani knows how to make a balanced varietal wine, and this clean, ripe Chardonnay completely satisfies, with fruity flavors and a rich balance of creamy oak, coastal acidity and spicy oak.",US
5673,US,"Searing acidity marks this wine, which tastes like it has a lot of Edna Valley fruit in the blend. It also shows bright, strong, long hangtime flavors of limes and pineapples. It's actually quite a fine Chardonnay, dry and low in alcohol. A great value at this price.",US
5674,US,"This is a very rich Chardonnay, almost too elaborated and overworked. It's tremendous in oak-infused fruit, with dominating buttered toast, crème brûlée and pineapple pie flavors. Very crisp coastal acidity provides a pleasant balance of tartness. Drink now.",US
5675,US,"A beautiful, lush Chardonnay, made in the ripe California style. Rich and creamy, marked with brisk acidity, it shows wonderful flavors of pineapples, roasted marshmallows, buttered toast and vanilla, with a tart, spicy scour of lime. Brilliant and complex. The vineyards were a combination of Sierra Madre and Bien Nacido.",US
5676,US,"Shows amazingly ripe fruit, offering a blast of pineapple jam, apricot, tangerine, papaya and lime flavors. The acidity is crisp and tart, and the oak is rich and flamboyant, yet in keeping with the size of the underling wine. Super-rich and decadent, this Chardonnay is at its best soon.",US
5677,US,"Lots of exotic flavors in this barrel-fermented Chardonnay. Its deep in gold color, indicating richness and oak, and follows through with pineapples, mangos, tangerine sorbet, buttered toast, buttercotch, vanilla cream and cinnamon spice. Great price for a Chard this good.",US
5678,US,"Williams Selyem is now playing the unoaked game, and with their fruit sources, wow. Most winemakers would kill to put oak onto these grapes. The wine is tremendous in pineapples, pears, papayas and kiwi fruit. It's so rich, you won't even notice the absence of caramel and all those oaky influences.",US
5679,US,"It's common to complain that American oak isn't as good as French oak, but this wine disproves that. The wood shows up as rich in caramel, buttered toast and vanilla spice notes that provide a lovely counterpoint to the wine's grilled pineapple and lime fruit. This is a beautiful, interesting Chardonnay.",US
5680,US,"Probably the most expensive unoaked Chard out there, this is a stunning wine, showing the laserlike purity and bright acids that this northwestern part of the Highlands coaxes from the grapes. The brilliantly illuminated flavors range from limes and kiwis to green apples, peaches and guavas. The finish is dry, but with a honeyed unctuousness that could be a touch of botrytis.",US
5681,US,"At first pass, this feels a little tired, with a somewhat feeble nose and flavors that could tend toward bitter. But in the mouth, the wine impresses—the fruit is pretty and round, the mouthfeel smooth. Spice and fruit come together nicely and chase away any austerity that may be lurking. The finish is good and layered.",US
5682,US,"From giant Brown-Forman, it's a lip-smackingly fruity Chard, bigtime in pineapple, vanilla and smoky caramel flavors, with a sweet, honeyed finish.",US
5683,US,"With this wine's slightly rustic character, it makes it a slightly harder Chardonnay to love, but interesting notes of spice add interest. The wine lacks some dimension but overall, offers pretty flavors and a food-friendly minerality.",US
5684,US,"Entirely barrel-fermented in older barrels, this wine nevertheless shows plenty of buttered toast aromas to go with its tropical fruit. It's broad in the mouth, medium-bodied and turns citrusy on the finish.",US
5685,US,"This is an elegant Chardonnay that will pair well with upscale fare, like scallops in a curry cream sauce. It's forward in ripe pineapple, pear, peach and lime flavors, with a smoky, crème brûlée richness that finishes in a swirl of spicy vanilla and smoky oak. Seems at its best now.",US
5686,US,"Super-ripe, superoaky, and while these are potential pitfalls, Testarossa handles them with aplomb. The flavors really impress, offering a detonation of creamy, smoky oak and imposingly rich pineapple custard and crème brûlée. It's all balanced by zesty acidity. Drink this flashy Chardonnay now.",US
5687,US,"This is a new winery for me, and it's produced quite an impressive wine. It's big, thick, mouth-filling, with creamy pineapple custard and spice flavors and a firm, acidic minerality that is clearly a function of terroir. Impresses not only for power but finesse.",US
5688,US,"There aren't a lot of wines coming off this appellation, and most of them are red. But this is a wonderful Chard. Ripe and detailed, it combines tropical fruit, mineral and oak flavors, and is dry and tart in acids. This is one of the few California Chardonnays I would age for up to ten years.",US
5689,US,"The vineyard is in the Green Valley, and the acidity is very high, giving a bright purity to the kiwi, Key lime pie, pineapple custard and crème brûlée flavors. Lots of toasty new French oak and lees bring super creaminess to the mouthfeel. White Burgundy is the model, expressed California-style.",US
5690,US,"Plenty of richness here, mangoes, pineapple custard, Key lime pie, not to mention smoky, caramelly, butterscotchy oak, but there's also a streamlined, sleek minerality that leaves a lip-smacking steely feeling behind. Part of that is acidity. Really fine wine.",US
5691,US,"Brisk and ripe, this Chard, from a cool region on San Luis Obispo, shows a classic profile of pure kiwi and lime fruit flavor. A layer of oak adds caramel, butterscotch and vanilla flavors. It all finishes in a long, spicy swirl of orange blossom honey.",US
5692,US,"There's a minerality to this pleasantly dry Chard, a stony tang that dominates, although you'll find pineapple underpinnings. It's a leaner, more elegant style, and the winemaker has tried to enrich it with oak, sur lie aging and 50% malolactic fermentation.",US
5693,US,"This is a new, reserve-style wine from veteran Ferrari-Carano. It shows its cool-climate origins in the brisk acidity that boosts well-ripened pineapple tart, green apple sauce, and Key lime pie flavors. It's also extremely oaky, and would be a better wine if it had less barrel influence.",US
5694,US,"I found the winery's regular '04 disappointing. This commemorative bottling is oakier and much riper in tropical fruit flavors, with non-malolactic crisp acidity and a buttercream texture. Somehow, though, it lacks the power and follow-through a great Chard should have, especially at this price.",US
5695,US,"Lots of rich, ripe, forward fruit in this well-oaked wine, with tart green apple, pineapple, lime and kiwi flavors. It's stylishly dry, with a nice, creamy finish.",US
5696,US,"This impressive Chardonnay from a small Livermore Valley producer is on the austere side of Chardonnay, with notes of just-ripe pear, tiny hints of wet stone, a nice, nutty finish and enough body to go with a wealth of foods. Good balance too.",US
5697,US,"Horse & Plow sourced organic grapes to craft this excellent Chardonnay, giving it the luxe treatment—handpicked, whole-cluster pressed, French oak barrel fermentation and aging nine months sur lee—and it shows. The wine is pretty, with a tropical bouquet that gives way to just enough oak-driven vanilla. Will age nicely but is also ready to drink now.",US
5698,US,"This Chardonnay is so delicious in citrus, tropical fruit, peach and vanilla bean flavors, brightened with brisk acidity, that you hardly miss the absence of oak.",US
5699,US,"Lives up to its reserve status, being the creamiest and most densely packed of Roche's several new Chardonnays. With brisk, bright acidity and ripe flavors of pineapples, Key lime pie and vanilla cream, its buttered toast and char flavors provide the perfect counterpoint from oak barrel aging.",US
5700,US,"Fragrant and lush with floral/citrus aromas, this stainless-fermented Chardonnay is inviting and seductive. Brilliant, bright fruit anchors a wine that is tense and dense and vividly thrilling. The acids are natural and flavors seamlessly run from lemon/lime to pineapple to orange, and keep on keeping on, with fresh, water-washed rock in the finish.",US
5701,US,"Lots of razzle-dazzle in this rich, opulent Chardonnay. Shows buttery, oak-inspired pear and pineapple flavors, with a leesy, creamy mouthfeel, and fine acidity to brighten and balance all that richness. Drink this decadent wine with lobster, scallops, crab or shrimp, or a great ahi tuna tartare with potato chips.",US
5702,US,"This is classic Washington Chardonnay, from the winery that first put it on the national map. It's beautifully built upon ripe apple, pineapple and kiwi fruit, with proportionate acid and lovely, lightly toasty oak. The alcohol is 14.3%, and the wine strikes a perfect note of weight and density, without being fat or fatiguing.",US
5703,US,"Always an interesting wine, Talbott's '03 Diamond T is so distinctive, it's almost eccentric. The candied apricots and cinnamon flavors have a baked pie-filling taste. With high acidity and a minerally edge, this Chard will develop nutty complexities over the next three to five years.",US
5704,US,"A terrific Chardonnay. You won't miss the oak at all. Offers a wealth of pineapple pie, Meyer lemon sorbet, green apple jam and vanilla flavors, brightened by clean, crisp coastal acidity. Sommeliers, buy this one in quantity. Easy to find, with 45,000 cases produced.",US
5705,US,"This is a big, oaky, creamy Chardonnay, but it retains the crisp acidity and overall control to be balanced and even elegant despite its size. Shows potent flavors of pineapple-infused crème brûlée, butterscotch and vanilla custard. Drink now.",US
5706,US,"Bright and zesty, with flavors of limes, kiwi fruit, green apples and pineapples, accompanied by crisp acidity. Could almost be an Edna Valley Chardonnay. Oak plays only a supporting role.",US
5707,US,"Shows the extreme dryness, crisp acidity, flowers and minerality that often mark Carneros Chadonnays, which makes it elegant and sleek. With a touch of Meyer lemons and limes, it rises to richness. Drink now.",US
5708,US,"A clean, classic minerality leads on this unique and food-friendly Chardonnay. On the palate, fresh fruit flavors mingle with a touch of oak, and the finish offers both length and character.",US
5709,US,"A soft, feminine nose of toasted oak and round fruit on the nose, and a flavor profile of balanced fruit and acid on the palate, make this a good white for both cold weather, serious meals and just sipping on the patio in warmer months. The mouthfeel is a touch light and the wine could use some weight, but overall, a good choice for numerous dishes.",US
5710,US,"New oak seems to dominate this Chard, swamping the actual flavor of the wine. The grapes provide lovely apricots and pineapples, balanced with fine acidity, but the oak swamps with smoke and vanilla and sappy wood cream.",US
5711,US,"A little thin and herbal, but shows enough Chard character to accompany good shellfish or a chicken or veal dish. Modestly oaked, the wine has peach, tangerine, buttercream and smoky flavors.",US
5712,US,"Here's an everyday, country-style Chardonnay with good enough flavors of tropical fruits and smoky vanilla oak, and a nicely creamy texture, to satisfy.",US
5713,US,"Creamy fresh white fruit and toast on the nose hint at a fullness that the wine does not quite deliver on the palate, but overall the fruit is good. This tends toward tart and needs the balance of more oak to cut the edge.",US
5714,US,"Showing true cool-climate character, this Chard brims with tropical fruit, pear, honeysuckle and smoky oaky-vanilla flavors, with a gentle scour of acids. Pretty good price for a wine this rich.",US
5715,US,"Made in the powerhouse Talbott style, which is extremely strong and powerful in flavor, and generously oaked. Floods the mouth with pineapple-infused crème brûlée, grilled pear, candied ginger, buttered toast, fire-toasted meringue, butterscotch, vanilla, white chocolate and even some botrytis flavors that are balanced with crisp acidity. These wines rapidly disintegrate with age, but it's flamboyant now.",US
5716,US,"This is an intense, tightly wound Chardonnay, with potent flavors and high acidity. It dazzles with flavors of grilled ripe pineapples, green apples, Key lime pie, honey, vanilla and new oak that are flamboyant from entry to spicy finish. Not likely to age before the fruit fades, so drink now and through 2011.",US
5717,US,"A lovely Chardonnay that's marked by a steely minerality that braces and provides structure to the pineapple, lemondrop, honey and buttered toast flavors. Feels really elegant and creamy in the mouth. Easy to find, with nearly 13,000 cases produced, and a good price for the quality.",US
5718,US,"Tastes of new oak and is also acidic, a combo that makes the mouthfeel rather harsh and salty, despite obviously well-ripened fruit. May settle down and show softer, lusher notes in a year or so.",US
5719,US,"Shows classic Edna Valley Chardonnay structure and flavor, a brightly acidic, minerally wine with a great burst of Key lime pie, ripe kiwi, pineapple custard, honey and vanilla oak flavors.",US
5720,US,"From a cool appellation in a cool vintage, a balanced, drily crisp Chardonnay. Oak dominates, with toast, butterscotch and vanilla notes riding high over underlying green apple and kiwi fruit.",US
5721,US,"If you're a fan of big, oaky Chards, you'll like this one. It's rich and unctuous in ripe tropical fruit custard flavors, with the buttered toast, crème brûlée and smoky char that comes from new French barrels. But it has a perky acidity that lends it an appley, minerally note.",US
5722,US,"The winery must have held this back this long to let the acidity soften, but it's still a crisp Chardonnay. A big one, too, packed with tropical fruit, roasted coconut, creamy lees, steely mineral and new oak flavors. Give it until 2007 to resolve itself.",US
5723,US,"At four-plus years, the wine is hanging in there, maintaining fruit and freshness and picking up some aged, dried pineapple and peach character. It's an interesting wine, picking up textural complexities, but needs to be drunk soon.",US
5724,US,"Fresh tropical fruit, peach and apricot flavors star in this flashy young wine. Oak also plays a prominent role, giving buttered toast and caramel notes. And the texture is creamy and smooth. The overall impression is very rich and powerful, but the wine could have more finesse. Drink now.",US
5725,US,"Lincourt's grapes are so rich and well grown that they don't even need oak to make a delicious Chardonnay. The wine is dry and crisp, with appealing flavors of pineapples, tangerines and Meyer lemons. The savory creaminess seems to come from aging on the lees. What a great food wine.",US
5726,US,"Rich and opulent, in the California coastal style. The grapes come from some respected Carneros vineyards, including Hyde and Stanly Ranch, and the pedigree shows in the balance of ripeness and acidity. With pineapple, mango, green apple, crème brûlée and buttered toast flavors, it's just delicious. Great with Dungeness crab and sourdough bread and butter.",US
5727,US,"Offering none of the oaky, fruity richness of popular Chardonnays, this bottle needs to be figured out in a different way. It's super-dry, acidic and minerally, with citrus fruit flavors that seem barely touched by oak. It's a wine of structural integrity, made in the style of a great Chablis. One of the rare Chardonnays that should age.",US
5728,US,"An acidic, minerally Chardonnay  showing structure, cleanliness and elegance. Richness comes by way of intense limes, as well as the usual complexities of new oak and lees aging, and there is not the slightest suggestion of sweetness. This is a very pure, Zen-like expression of cool-climate California Chardonnay.",US
5729,US,"Beautiful young bubbly, light and elegant, with Chardonnay flavors of peaches and limes, enriched with leesy dough and smoky spice. The texture is ultrarefined, with a very fine mousse. This is one of the best, most complex Chandon bruts in a long time.",US
5730,US,"Acidity marks this Chardonnay. It gives a tart, mouth-cleansing citrusy scour to the lemon and lime and pineapple flavors that finish so dry. It's a minimalist wine, with a minerally frame, and quite good with shellfish.",US
5731,US,"Nice and dry, with crisp, citrusy acidity and a touch of creamy oak. Shows savory flavors of Meyer lemons, limes and tingly Asian spices, with a touch of green apple butter. Clean and food-friendly.",US
5732,US,"Really nice, fragrant and floral with lovely clover and peach highlights. It's dusty and elegant, a truly stylish and very affordable Chardonnay. There's just a bit of sharpness in the finish, gently fading into toast.",US
5733,US,"Good tropical fruit, green apple and buttercream flavors in this bone-dry wine. It has a slightly rugged, earthy taste as well, of dried herbs and tobacco. A sound Chardonnay.",US
5734,US,"There's lots to like about this cool-climate Chardonnay, from the ripe pineapple, kiwi and lime flavors to the rich touch of lees and vanilla. It has a sharp cut of acidity that's almost Champagne-like, and calls for extremely rich fare to balance. Try with shrimp risotto.",US
5735,US,"A rush of zippy, fresh fruit and spice aromas recommends this white from New York, offering the kind of clean fruit flavors and minerality that makes this region unique. The wine lacks real complexity and tends toward the austere but the beguiling spice saves the day.",US
5736,US,"A deep golden color and classic Chardonnay fruit and spice aromas, albeit with a touch of sweetness, begin this wine. On the palate, the fruit is fresh and good but lacks the layering and grounding that oak should offer. Overall it's a good everyday wine that just needs a touch of class to round out the rough edges; food may be the key.",US
5737,US,"This Chardonnay is creamy and scented with vanilla, ripe apple and pineapple. The fruit has a slightly overripe quality, a suggestion of funk on the finish, and the vanilla seems artificial. It says unoaked, but that's a lot of vanilla nonetheless.",US
5738,US,"A subtle nose of butter and spice leads this wine whose flavors are varietally correct but not terribly inspired. The fruit is balanced and round but the finish slightly watery. Not a bad everyday sip, but needs complexity.",US
5739,US,"Brings Foxen's usual steely, dry, minerally approach to Chardonnay, which makes for a more versatile, elegant wine. It's bone dry, while high acidity makes the mouth water, but the austerity is relieved by the ripeness of the citrus, peach and apple fruit. Should develop through 2013, becoming creamier and nuttier.",France
5740,US,"You want soft, gooey Chardonnay? Go someplace else. This is a steely, minerally, bracing wine whose high acidity makes your mouth water. It has a little oak, but is mainly noted for the intensity of pineapple, peach and vanilla flavors. Very nice with shellfish and pasta in a cream sauce.",US
5741,US,"The vineyard is on the Carneros border, and this Chard has lots of juicy acidity, which may also be due to the winemaker picking the grapes at a relatively low ripeness level. The pepper- and mineral-infused flavors suggest peaches and grapefruits, enriched with new oak and lees. This is an extremely dry, food-friendly wine.",US
5742,US,"Almost sweet in pineapple custard, marzipan and butterscotch flavors, and there may even be a bit of residual sugar in this honey-rich Chard. Saved by a crisp backbone of acidity.",US
5743,US,"Shows what is becoming the classic profile of unoaked, cool-climate Chard. Clean, crisp and minerally, the wine shows high-toned flavors of ripe kiwis, limes, passionfruit, pineapples, green apples, vanilla and cinnamon-spice. A match for scallops with mango salsa.",US
5744,US,"Good everyday Chard, with direct flavors of pineapples and kiwis, and the buttercream and smoky vanillins that oak barrels contribute. Finishes dry and crisp.",US
5745,US,"Shows the dramatic structure of a fine coastal Chardonnay, with crisp acidity and a bracing minerality framing ripe, lush flavors of pineapples, tangerines, pears and sweet, caramelized oak. Very rich and fine, deserving of the best shellfish, salmon, ahi tuna.",US
5746,US,"This is a big, ripe, rich and oaky Chardonnay, the kind that will seduce lots of people with sheer dazzle, although only 135 cases were produced so it's likely to be hard to find. Dry and crisp, it's concentrated in pineapple tart and peach marmalade flavors, accented with plenty of sweet, smoky oak, and brightened with crisp Monterey acidity.",US
5747,US,"Has great weight and texture, with an unctuous, oily mouthfeel, and is crisp and dry. Almost like a great Chablis, with a tang of steel and minerals undergirding the limes, pineapples and wildflowers. The grapes are from the well-regarded Sierra Madre Vineyard.",US
5748,US,"A rich, brisk and complex Chardonnay that shows cool-climate structure and the ripe fruit that comes from a good vintage and great viticulture, in a difficult growing region. The pineapple, pear and golden mango flavors are enriched with lots of smoky, buttery oak, and offset with crisp acidity. Decadent and delicious.",US
5749,US,"The grapes are from all parts of the valley, cool as well as warm, and the wine shows a complex structure and rich fruity flavors. The tiers of pineapples, tangerines, sautéed bananas, green apples and butterscotch have a honeyed, botrytisy richness, although the finish is thoroughly dry.",US
5750,US,"This is a polished, really likeable Chard. It offers everything the variety should: a rich, creamy texture, brisk acidity, and ripe, delicious flavors of pineapples, apricots, peaches and kiwis coated with vanilla.",US
5751,US,"The vineyard is on the cooler western edge of Paso Robles, and this bottling has been getting better over the years. The '07 is the best yet, a dry, crisp wine of richness and polish. Shows pineapple, nectarine and guava flavors, with a subtle minerality, creamy mouthfeel, and a fine coating of smoky oak.",US
5752,US,"Fancy, with racy acidity and rich oak framing ripe natural flavors of pineapple brûlée, pear concentrate and Meyer lemon essence. Rich, but balanced and elegant.",US
5753,US,"Buena Vista has a good reputation for this bottling, and the great '07 vintage has resulted in another fine Chardonnay, at a good price. Racy in acidity, the wine shows mineral-infused citrus fruit, apple and honeysuckle notes that finish with a touch of off-dry sweetness.",France
5754,US,"This series of wines, under the Badger Mountain label of Powers winery, uses grapes that are organically grown. Minimal sulfites are added. This a fresh, forward, deliciously fruity Chardonnay, loaded with a classy mix of apple, pear and peach fruit. A great springtime sipper.",US
5755,US,"This is Geyser Peak's barrel-fermented Chardonnay. It shows classic Alexander Valley ripeness, with rich tropical fruit, green apple, pear, buttered popcorn and vanilla flavors, accented with racy acidity. Very nice now with roast salmon, crab or a simple roast chicken.",US
5756,US,"A nose of clean citrus and spice leads on this simple but likeable Chardonnay. On the palate, it offers more of the fresh flavors and the finish is crisp. A nice wine with seafood and salad, and a good choice for fans of lively whites.",US
5757,US,"A fresh, fruity nose with hints of spice lend an alluring start to this Chardonnay, but on the palate, flavors run a little thin.  That said, an appealing toasted oak spice character adds dimension.",US
5758,US,"Soft, subtle flavors of classic Chardonnay mingle with warming spice in this friendly but simple white. Pair with salad or seafood.",US
5759,US,"This friendly, likeable wine offers approachable, slightly sweet flavors—fruity and fresh—that are not complex but will pair well with food.",US
5760,US,"Simple and superoaky, with strong flavors of vanilla and char dominating an otherwise average Chard. Under all that smoky wood you'll find a wine of modest peach, pineapple and apricot flavors.",US
5761,US,"The wine, a three-county blend, shows some creamy, oaky notes and good varietal flavors of pineapples, apples and pears.",US
5762,US,"Ripe, soft and creamy smooth, this Chard has polished flavors of pineapple jam, vanilla, pears, apple butter, honey and cinnamon.",US
5763,US,"Achieves the alchemy of well-toasted oak and perfectly ripe fruit to produce this luscious, creamy Chardonnay. Mangoes, papayas, pineapple custard, caramel, vanilla, it's all there, along with crisp, balancing acidity.",US
5764,US,"Many wineries have taken fruit from this vineyard, generally with good results. The '05 Lucas & Lewellen shows its terroir, with a cool-climate crispness backing up ripe pineapple tart, nectarine and papaya flavors. But the oak-inspired caramel, char and butterscotch is a bit heavy-handed.",US
5765,US,"Here's your basic straightforward upscale California Chard. It's forward in tropical fruit and oaky butterscotch and vanilla char flavors, wrapped into a creamy texture. There's a touch of green in the finish, though.",US
5766,US,"One hundred percent new French oak is the dominant theme here. It floods the mouth with the flavors of buttered toast and vanilla. The oak influence is strong, but the underlying wine has some equally strong pineapple, mango and apple fruit. It's made in a rich California style you either love or hate.",US
5767,US,"Notable for very high acidity, this Chard would be aggressive were it not for the ripe, honeyed flavors and creamy texture, which soften it up. The flavors are very pure and clean: of kiwi, lime, mango and papaya.",US
5768,US,"Lovely scents of apple blossoms lead into a fine, textural wine that proves you can put the focus on the fruit without sacrificing complexity. Drinking this is like biting into a bowl of mixed apples, with a delightful fruit salad effect. It's lightly dusted with cinnamon accents, which linger in an elegantly toasty finish. The wine keeps its balance and its delicacy throughout.",US
5769,US,"Here's a polished Chard with an elegant balance to a variety that often lacks both. Everything is here, from the ripe tropical fruit and rich oak to the crisp acidity and mineral trimmings, all poised in perfect equilibrium.",US
5770,US,"This is all Birch Creek vineyard, barrel fermented, 100% malo, about one third new wood, one third one year, the rest neutral. It's a soft, fleshy, buttery, California style, but nothing overblown. There's plenty of new oak flavor, good ripe fruit, and enough acid to support the yellow apple and melon fruit.",US
5771,US,"A fine Chardonnay, which Ferrari-Carano can usually be depended on to produce. Shows crowd-pleasing flavors of pineapple jam, butterscotch, crème brûlée and vanilla custard. Easy to find, with 42,000 cases produced.",US
5772,US,"This Chardonnay marches to its own beat. It's not one of those oaky, ultra-ripe wines, but instead shows a dry, herb-infused minerality you might call Chablisian. Shows modest fruit flavors of pineapples, while the oak is restrained. Drink this elegant Chard now.",US
5773,US,"A very lush, fruity wine, if a bit soft, with flavors of pineapples, lemon custard, buttered toast and smoky vanilla. Satisfies for its richness and creamy texture.",US
5774,US,"Partially barrel fermented and aged on the lees, this Chard has a creamy texture, and good flavors of pears, pineapples, figs and vanilla. Brisk acidity makes the finish clean and tart.",US
5775,US,"This new release from Waterbrook is a slimmed down version of previous efforts, with rather plain fruit flavors and no discernible new oak influence. Not that that is necessarily a bad thing, but when Chardonnay is built upon little but simple green apple fruit flavors the grape's lack of character sometimes makes you wish for the return of the good old oaky days.",US
5776,US,"A light, subtle nose is followed by simple but elegant Chardonnay flavors and a successful play of oak and acid. The mouthfeel is equally appealing, round and supple. The wine could use more complexity but overall, is enjoyable and will be good with a variety of richer poultry and seafood dishes.",US
5777,US,Nice bright fruit aromas and a lively play of minerality and good fresh fruit make this a definite everyday choice for fans of cleaner whites. The wine is not terribly deep but it's playful and flavorful.,US
5778,US,"This is a wine that takes some time to warm up to—on first sniff there's a somewhat sulfuric, rustic aroma to it. On the palate, a viscous mouthfeel feels a bit heavy, but then there's the fruit, which exhibits good classic Chardonnay flavors and is balanced by elegant oak. A good choice for casual sipping.",US
5779,US,"A rustic but likeable Chardonnay, this offers subtle flavors of oak and fruit in a balanced but somewhat innocuous package. Not much beyond the initial wave of flavors; it wants more complexity and weight.",US
5780,US,"A spicy, tingling nose leads. followed by reserved balance elements of acid, classic Chardonnay fruit and a slatey minerality. Not terribly complex but likeable, and food friendly.",US
5781,US,"Pineapple and spice on the nose are followed by like flavors on the palate. An interplay of acid adds quality to the wine but overall, it lacks dimension and the kind of layering that typifies good Chardonnay.",US
5782,US,"Though found in some Chardonnays, there's a heaviness to this wine, with its orange Muscat nose and syrupy flavors, that seems out of sync here. The wine seems to flop onto the palate and sit there, without much progression. Needs more acid and a lighter touch.",US
5783,US,"Fresh, crisp minerality—a quality that can take a good wine to great heights in the right proportion—seems to hinder this wine. The lack of fruit and oak balance feels tart and thin.",US
5784,US,"Earthy aromas of Chardonnay fruit and toast lead on this wine with a   somewhat prickly character. Lean and simple, it wants more spice and a softer mouthfeel to make it work.",US
5785,US,"Tastes sugared, and the fruit is thin, making the alcohol taste hot.",US
5786,US,"A somewhat candied nose leads, and on the palate, a clumsy sweetness creates a flabbiness over simple fruit that seems unnecessary. Lacks poise but will pair well with cheeses and seafood.",US
5787,US,"This is a creative if not entirely successful wine; its intense, lavish aromas are followed by a surprisingly rustic wave of fruit that has a spin of austerity to it. One-dimensional and rough around the edges.",US
5788,US,"There's an appealing earthiness on the nose and palate, but the overall character is a bit discordant. It has some complexity but not the balance one wants from a Chardonnay.",US
5789,US,"This is a very flamboyant Chardonnay. The grapes are superripe in pie-filling pineapples, nectarines and oranges, enhanced with smoky oak and sweet buttered popcorn, but the finish is completely dry. Drink now with rich fare, like lobster and shellfish.",US
5790,US,"Made in a less ripe style, with citrusy, herbal flavors that are well-oaked and leesy, this very dry Chard displays both elegance and a long finish. If you're into aging Chardonnays, try cellaring this through 2010. Should be fine.",US
5791,US,"Lots of flash in this relatively inexpensive Chardonnay, which shares many of the qualities of far more expensive wines. Flamboyantly ripe tropical fruit, opulent oak with creamy buttered toast and vanilla, a rich, voluptuous texture, waves of complexity and crisp, balancing cool-climate acidity—it's all there.",US
5792,US,"Bright acids liven up very ripe papaya, pineapple and Key lime pie flavors, wrapped in a rich, creamy texture. The wine finishes with lots of spicy, smoky oak.",US
5793,US,"Made in a very ripe, very oaky manner, this Chardonnay is extraordinarily rich now, if not very subtle. It's all about power. Buttered toast, caramel cream, pineapple marmalade, lime, orange and spice flavors flood the mouth, snapping to an oaky finish.",US
5794,US,Aromas of apple and tropical fruit on this rich Chardonnay lead into vanilla and honey on the palate. The wine is full and opulent in the mouth but not overwrought. Good balance and a lingering finish add to the appeal.,US
5795,US,"Released unusually at the age of nearly five years, this Chardonnay is losing its primary fruit. It's developing a toasted cashew and hazelnut character, and the pineapples are transmogrifying to chewy dried fruits and even Christmas fruitcake. Meanwhile the sweet, caramelized oak is fully integrated. Bravo to the winery for holding this back and letting us see what an older Sonoma Coast Chardonay does.",US
5796,US,"A very interesting Chardonnay, and easily worth the price. It was fermented in 50% new French oak, which gives it a creamy, smoky richness, while the underlying fruit flavors are ripe and rewarding, suggesting pineapples, Asian pears, green apples and Meyer lemons. A beautiful, complex and balanced wine.",US
5797,US,"Shows mouthwatering acidity and long hangtime flavors of pineapple essence, papaya, butterscotch, vanilla crème brûlée and toast, yet for all that richness, finishes dry. This is a good price for all that richness.",US
5798,US,"A pretty, floral nose adds a surprising dimension to this wine, but on the palate, the flavors fall somewhat flat. A good balance of oak and fruit prevails, but the nose suggests more.",US
5799,US,"There's a lack of balance, with thin, slightly bitter fruit overriding any complexity that may have been achieved with more oak. This is not offensive, it just lacks character.",US
5800,US,"Oaky influences give this wine a candied taste of caramel and lime pie, on top of the grapier flavors of pineapples and pears. It's solidly in the mode of what Americans want in a Chardonnay.",US
5801,US,"A plump, medium-bodied Chardonnay with a deft touch of oak, this is what most California Chardonnay drinkers are looking for in an entry-level wine. Slightly nutty, toasty elements frame bold pineapple and citrus flavors.",US
5802,US,"A sharp, edgy wine, lifted with a bit of volatility, then smoothed over with a honeyed sweetness. Very ripe, soft, peachy and definitely ready to drink.",US
5803,US,"This is a balanced, easy to drink Chardonnay, with citrus, peach and green apple flavors that have been finished with a veneer of smoky oak. It's totally dry. Do not overchill it, as it's a delicate wine that needs some warmth to open up.",US
5804,US,"Byron's regular Chardonnay has historically been a very good wine. This continues that tradition, rich in tropical fruits, but extremely dry, with a stony minerality and high acids that stimulate the taste buds and call for rich fare.",France
5805,US,"If you're looking for a kosher Chard, try this one. It's a fine wine, rich in fruit, well-oaked and balanced, with the creamy, full-bodied mouthfeel you want in this varietal. The peach custard, pineapple and kiwi flavors are simply delicious.",US
5806,US,"A little on the thin side, fruit-wise, although there's a wealth of toasty oak, and the wine possesses that bright acidity so associated with the vineyard and appellation. The flavors veer toward apricots and papayas. While official alcohol is only 14.5%, the finish is chili-pepper hot.",US
5807,US,"Lots of peach, pear and pineapple fruit here, with a tasty layer of vanilla and smoke. A good value.",US
5808,US,"This is an earthy Chardonnay, with restrained peach and spice flavors and a kiss of oak. It's also very dry. Has some real complexity in the structure and the finish.",US
5809,US,"This is all Birch Creek vineyard fruit, barrel fermented and put through full malolactic. It's soft, fleshy and buttery, with good ripe light tropical fruit, lots of barrel flavor, and enough acid to support it all. Both Rulo Chardonnays are perfect expressions of their style—one oaked, one unoaked—each in fine balance and proportion.",US
5810,US,"Shows the slight tug of herbaceousness that often marks Carneros/Napa Chardonnays. But it's very dry and crisp, and there's a minerality that helps this lemon- and lime-flavored wine pair cleanly with shellfish, salmon or just a good roast chicken.",US
5811,US,"A very nice Chardonnay that's dry and crisp and elegant. Shows tart, leesy flavors of citrus fruits, apricots and pears, with a steely minerality that may come from those famous Livermore rocks. Great price for a Chardonnay of this quality.",US
5812,US,"Beaucoup butter, caramel and toasted nut flavors; 80% of this reserve Chardonnay went through malolactic. It's got plenty of fruit power and acid; but it's mostly the French oak barrel flavors that stand out at this young age.",US
5813,US,"Big, oaky and loaded with butterscotch, this is a lush take on Chardonnay, mixing rich streaks of tropical fruit and pear with new oak flavors powered by buttered toast and butterscotch. It's big, broad and yummy – what more do you want?",US
5814,US,"So high in acidity that it creates a tingly burn on the palate, this dry wine is bright and forward in lemon and lime flavors, and a tangy minerality. Finishes fine and clean.",US
5815,US,"Very dry, and on the earthy side, this Chard is marked more by controlled elegance than by opulent fruit. There are flavors of lemons and limes and tart green apples, with additional complexities from barrel fermentation and sur lies aging. The finish is fairly acidic.",US
5816,US,"Very fruity, with bright melon, pineapple and red apple flavors. It's a step up from the well-made 2003, with crisp fruit and a bit more complexity. A second taste reveals a tart, racy, fruit-forward food wine with fine balance; a great choice for seafood or chicken salad.",US
5817,US,"Crisp, bright acidity marks this dry, clean Chardonnay. It's bone dry, but rewardingly fruity, showing ripe peach, pear and pineapple flavors, with a richer streak of crème brûlée. Easy to find, with 23,544 cases made.",US
5818,US,"Rich and full bodied, this is a tremendously ripe Chardonnay that explodes with peach custard, orange popsicle, pineapple, crème brûlée and cinnamon spice flavors, leading to a long, fruity finish.",US
5819,US,"The big acidity on this wine and the citrus fruit flavors make it kind of austere and minerally. But partial new oak and sur lie aging add some richness. This is a very dry, elegant, structural Chard meant for food. Try with a firm white fish topped with a fruity salsa.",US
5820,US,"A well-behaved Chard with a streak of minerality that uplifts the apple and peach flavors, as well as lees and oak. Finishes a bit rough and earthy, with tobacco leaf acidity.",US
5821,US,"I tasted this alongside a Chard costing more than twice as much, and it held its own. The fruit, acids, oak, spice and creamy texture come together in an appealingly balanced package. Finishes dry, long and complex, but just a tad thin.",US
5822,US,"Here's a compact, young Chard that's tight in minerals and acidity, riding high over well-oaked tropical fruit and peach flavors. It's closed now, and should be allowed to breathe for a while. Drink now through 2009.",US
5823,US,"There's just too much oak on this otherwise fine Chard. It's like drinking toothpicks, all sweet vanilla char, toasted meringue and caramel. Too bad, because the underlying wine is filled with polished mineral and fruit flavors.",US
5824,US,"Oak stars in this Chard—too much oak, in fact. Vanilla, char, wood sap, woody spice and smoke tastes dominate the tropical fruit, peach and citrus flavors.",US
5825,US,"Charred oak brings vanilla, buttered toast, spice and other barrel notes, but can't quite elevate the underlying wine, which has vegetal flavors. It's also high in acids. Not bad, but expensive for what you get.",US
5826,US,"This is one of those earthy Chards, the kind that bring to mind dusty brown spices. It's got appley and smoky, woody flavors, and is dry.",US
5827,US,"Heavily oaked with well-charred wood, so you get lots of upfront toast. Below is a nice Chard with pleasant peach and apple flavors. Finishes dry and spicy.",US
5828,US,"It's all here, the ripe, fruity flavors,  creaminess, the lees, spices and oak, in a somewhat countrified Chard that could use a lighter touch and more finesse.",US
5829,US,"Tastes a bit old for a Chard, with the fruit fading. It's still lively in acids, and has enough pear and apple flavors to satisfy. Finishes quick, and overall, it's not what it should be.",US
5830,US,"Absolutely beautiful, one of the best unoaked Chardonnays on the market. Brims with bright, clean flavors of pineapples, limes and kiwis, along with vanilla and a touch of cinnamon spice. With its brisk scour of acidity, it's a super-drinkable wine.",US
5831,US,"A nice, lush Chardonnay. It lacks a bit of exciting structure, and depends too much on sheer dazzle. But it sure is rich in toasty oak-inspired pineapples, peaches, pears and limes. Good now with grilled shrimp.",US
5832,US,"Shows lots of dryness and austerity, with acidity, minerals and herbs accompanying the citrus and oak flavors. Not a flamboyant Chardonnay, but a controlled one that offers complexity. A good companion to fresh crab, with buttery garlic bread.",US
5833,US,"Lees and new oak seem to prevail in this wine, giving it a yeasty, caramelized taste that overpowers the fruit, which seems just fine in pineapples, peaches and limes.",US
5834,US,"The vineyard is inland, in the Delta region, and the wine has exaggerated flavors of sweet, baked apricots, mangoes and pears, with charred barrel notes of clove and vanilla.",US
5835,US,"Here's a rich Chardonnay with tropical fruit pastry flavors that have a dusty, dried herb edge, and lots of creamy oak. The wine is a bit soft. The fruit and spice flavors reprise on the long-lasting finish.",US
5836,US,"Richer and tarter than Kenwood's regular '05 Chard, this wine shows the acidity and green apple flavors of the central part of the valley. Bosc pears, Meyer lemons and white peaches pleasantly complicate things as you continue to sip.",US
5837,US,"Soft and sweet, although there's a lot going on, taste-wise. Flavors of pineapples, peaches, pears and vanilla are wrapped into an oaky, creamy package. But the wine would benefit from more acidity and less sweetness.",US
5838,US,"Good everyday Chard, a little minty, but rewards for its upfront pineapple pie, peaches and cream and vanilla smoke flavors. The tart acidity actually works to balance out the richness.",US
5839,US,"A good effort from New Jersey's Unionville, this delicate Chard offers harmonious flavors of tropical fruit and flowers, with a touch of spice to add complexity. Balanced acid keeps the wine clean and light.",US
5840,US,"I like this smooth, dry wine, although it's rather overworked. The oak and lees are a bit obvious, yet the papaya and peach fruit flavors, and the acidity, are powerful enough to make it all work.",US
5841,US,"Compared to the winery's Starr Ridge Chard from the same vintage, this is unassertive. It's thicker in the mouth, and softer, with a malted, custard texture framing peach flavors.",US
5842,US,"This isn't one of your tropical fruit and oak, acidic cool-climate monster Chards. It's soft and earthy, with a dried sage and oregano edge to the green apple and white peach flavors.",US
5843,US,"Not showing much beyond a huge, unbalanced plaster of charred oak. Smells and tastes like toothpicks.",US
5844,US,"This is your basic dry, ripe California Chardonnay. A little rustic, with decent fruit and a kiss of oak and cream.",US
5845,US,"Rustic, despite some ripe peach and other stone fruit flavors and what tastes vaguely like oak.",US
5846,US,Shows the distinctly high acidity and laser-pure lemon and lime flavors that are so typical of this chilly appellation. You'll also find enriching oak and lees influences in this clean Burgundian-style wine.,US
5847,US,"A bit overt in oak, with vanilla and buttered toast aromas and flavors dominating. But you'll also find rich, flamboyant notes of pineapples, kiwi fruit and limes. Fancy and elegant, with broad restaurant appeal.",US
5848,US,"There's not much, if any, oak on this Chardonnay, leaving the fresh, clean fruit flavors to star. Shows a rich array of pineapples, Meyer lemons, yellow apricots and peaches, with spicy, vanilla overtones. Elegant, and a good buy at this price.",US
5849,US,"Creamy and lightly toasty, this elegant Chardonnay mixes its melon/apple fruit with vanilla cream and toasted cracker. The acid feels natural and brings in suggestions of pineapple, with a nice smack of butter kicking out the finish.",US
5850,US,"This is an enomoursly rich Chardonnay that positively explodes in apricot jam, pineapple, vanilla custard and butterscotch flavors. It's balanced with crisp, cool-climate Carneros acidity that makes it tangy and clean. Easy to find, with 33,000 cases produced.",US
5851,US,"Here's a tight, acidic young Chard from this cool-climate appellation. It's showing lots of mineral flavors now, against a background of Meyer lemon and apricot, and the finish is totally dry.",US
5852,US,"The home vineyard is in a cool, southeastern part of the valley, and you can smell the minerality in this crisp, young wine, grown in the fog. It's exceptionally bright in steely tangerine, kiwi and pineapple flavors whose smoky oak veneer is in perfect balance.",US
5853,US,"This is Chris Gorman's first white wine; it has been babied and it shows. The wild yeast fermentation in 100% new French oak really piles on the rich, butterscotch flavors, along with toast, spice, nutmeg and caramel. But there's fruit to match, powerful and thick, with impressive length and weight.",US
5854,US,"The winery's '05 reserve is oakier than their regular Chard, and the wine is heavier and less fresh, an impression heightened by full malolactic fermentation, which has softened the acidity and given a buttery taste.",US
5855,US,"There's no oak to give fans their daily dose of buttered toast and vanilla. But there is plenty of pure, unadulterated fruit—apricots and peaches to be exact. It's a rich, spicy wine that advances the argument for no-oak Chard.",US
5856,US,"This is St. Supery's other Chardonnay, the oaked one. It's not super-oaky, but it does have buttercream and vanilla notes in addition to the wine's apricot, peach and tangerine flavors. It's a very dry, somewhat tart but elegant wine.",US
5857,US,"Way too much oak on this rustic wine, and rather insipid, too, with its too-soft mouthfeel and slightly sweet, Lifesaver flavors.",US
5858,US,"Fruity, semi-sweet and heavily oaked, this bland Chardonnay has too much unnatural wood.",US
5859,US,"Very ripe and oaky, but a little on the obvious side, with flamboyant tropical fruit, honey and buttered toast flavors. Could use greater finesse, subtlety, complexity.",US
5860,US,"Soft and flabby, especially on the entry, without the acidity to balance the very ripe pineapple, guava and vanilla-oak flavors. A wine this flavorful desperately needs crispness.",US
5861,US,"Pretty thin in fruit, which makes the bare-bones alcohol, acids and oak stick out.",US
5862,US,"Basic Chard, if thin, with just enough peaches and cream, vanilla and toast flavors to satisfy.",US
5863,US,"This pleasant wine shows all the usual Chardonnay features of well-ripened tropical fruit and peach flavors, toasty oak, and a creamy, buttery mouthfeel. It's clean and brisk, with a long, fruity finish.",US
5864,US,"You'll find some tasty apricots, peach and vanilla-oak flavors in this soft, creamy wine. It's a nice California Chardonnay, slightly sweet in the finish, and a great accompaniment to salmon or pork.",US
5865,US,"This wine shows those crisp, bright, mouthwatering Central Coast acids. They perk up the lime and tropical fruit flavors enhanced with a touch of vanilla and smoke from barrels. Finishes spicy and dry.",US
5866,US,"There's a lot of Chard character here, in the flavors of peaches, pears, Asian spices, buttery toast and cream. A large proportion of the grapes came from Monterey, which also helps explain the crispness.",US
5867,US,"Handley's Anderson Valley bottling is always bright in acids, which are so nice and clean in a Chardonnay as fruity and rich as this. The flavors are a complex melange of pineapples, peaches and pears.",US
5868,US,"A lean, steely and slightly herbaceous Chardonnay, whose brisk elegance makes up for the absence of richness. This Chablis-style wine is marked by minerals and suggestions of lemons and limes, as well as strong acidity. Calls for fresh crab in the shell, with plenty of drawn butter for dipping.",US
5869,US,"Stainless steel fermented, this pure varietal is bursting with a tasty fruit bowl mix of apple, pineapple, and Meyer lemon. A hint of mint sneaks in, and the acidity brings bracing minerality to the finish.",US
5870,US,"Dry and richly oaked, with ripe flavors, this is a big Chardonnay. It shows massive flavors of pineapple custard, pear jam, butterscotch, buttered toast and caramel. A bit direct, but a crowd pleaser.",US
5871,US,"Dry and balanced, just 25% of this went through malolactic, it shows crisp apple, pear and citrus brightened with punchy acids. Just a hint of oak from aging in 25% new barrels.",US
5872,US,"A good collection of fruit flavors bring interest to this surprisingly ripe Chardonnay. Pineapple, green apple and light tropical fruits are set against pleasing barrel flavors of baked pear and glazed doughnut (really!).",US
5873,US,"The aim here seems to be to avoid ripe, opulent fruit in favor of an elegantly streamlined wine you might call Chablisian. The result is bone dry, high in aciditiy and lean, with mineral and citrus flavors. This is against the grain these days for fruity Chards.",France
5874,US,"Burgundian technique was used in this wine, and the aromas and tastes of those techniques dominate. The wine is heavy in leesy, yeasty, toasted oak notes, which dominate, rather than subtlely support, the underlying fruit.",US
5875,US,"Simple and easy, with oaky flavors of apricots, peaches and pineapples in a creamy texture. Fine for picnics and parties.",US
5876,US,"This is a ripely fruity wine with a dollop of French oak that's a textbook example of Lodi. Soft in acids, with powerful tropical fruit, nectarine, peach, pear and apple flavors, it offers clean, easy drinking.",US
5877,US,"A deeply satisfying and intense Chard, for its wealth of well-ripened tropical fruit, pear, key lime pie, vanilla and toast flavors and the refreshing acidity that makes the wine clean and lively. The long, complete finish is impressive. Defines the sunshine and chill of its appellation.",US
5878,US,"Earthy and minerally, and very dry, this Chard has a scour of high acidity. It's a lean wine, by the usual fruity standards, but a clean, complex one, rather Chablisian in its way, and might improve with some time in the cellar.",US
5879,US,"Made in a very ripe, extracted style, this eccentric wine has flavors of apricots, or more precisely, apricot marmalade on buttered toast, because it's also oaky. It's dry and crisp in acids. A bit unusual, but in its own way, a good wine.",US
5880,US,"Made in a very dry and acidic style, this wine has flavors of limes, honeydew melons and buttercream. It's tight and minerally, with a tart, high-acid finish, and seems designed to complement food.",US
5881,US,"Has everything the best Chards have, without quite the same complexity or depth, of course. But's it's a value for the rich pear, peach and pineapple flavors, creamy smooth texture, and sumptuous overlay of oak.",US
5882,US,"The price is right, but this wine is rather skimpy in fruit, over-oaked and too sweet.",US
5883,US,"Heavy and thick, like canned peach syrup, with too much oak and sweetness.",US
5884,US,"Not much going on. Clean and dry, with watery flavors of apples and oak.",US
5885,US,"Inviting, fresh, racy scents mix pineapple, citrus and light tropical fruits. There is an interesting mouthfeel not unlike Sémillon, though none is indicated in the blend. The wine has substantial length and unusual highlights of spice, clove and mint, along with plenty of rich, ripe fruit to hold down the center palate. Not shy at 14.8% alcohol, this is a fine effort from consulting winemaker Charlie Hoppes.",US
5886,US,"Good price for an upscale Chardonnay this rich and interesting. It's oaky, with vanilla and buttered toast flavors, but the underlying pineapple and Meyer lemon fruit easily supports the wood, while brisk, refreshing acidity provides balance.",US
5887,US,"A flamboyant Chardonnay. Shows flashy scents of vanilla and buttered toast from oak, riding high over pineapple, pear, golden mango and nectarine fruit. Crisp acidity provides needed balance to the richness. Good price for the quality.",US
5888,US,"A dry, streamlined wine, for those who don't like super-fruity, oaky ones. With a streak of minerals, it shows an elegant structure framing citrus, melon and peach flavors.",US
5889,US,"Rich and vibrant in acid-accented lime, peach, pink grapefruit and tangerine flavors, this creamy, smooth Chard is partly barrel fermented, which gives it a toasty, buttery edge.",US
5890,US,"Fans of oak and fruity tropical flavors will appreciate the price on this well-organized, everyday Chard. It shows pineapple custard, vanilla yogurt and cinnamon spice flavors wrapped into a dry, creamy texture set off by high acidity.",US
5891,US,"Here's a nice, clean Chardonnay whose best features are dryness and a rich coating of oak. The flavors veer toward peaches, apples and pineapples, along with a distinct spiciness and a bracing streak of minerality.",US
5892,US,"There's too much oak interfering with this Chardonnay, which was grown just below the Santa Lucia Highlands. The underlying fruit is fine, suggesting crisply ripe nectarines and pears, but the oak buries it under a plaster of smoky caramel and butterscotch.",US
5893,US,"This is the winery's big, barrel-fermented Chard. Even under all that creamy, smoky oak and leesy richness, those Edna Valley acids shine through, making the lime, kiwi and pineapple flavors bright, and leading to a zingy, crisp finish.",US
5894,US,"A junior version of the very fine Reserve, the '05 is ripe and forward in tropical fruit and flowery spice flavors, with an overlay of smoky, creamy oak. It's explosive, but balanced and controlled.",US
5895,US,"Here's a modest, likeable Chard, a bit soft, with pear, apple, peach and cream flavors. It's extremely well balanced, and has a satisfyingly long finish. Great with roast chicken or grilled fish with a brown butter sauce.",US
5896,US,"This is not a very good Chardonnay. It's thin and simple, with syrupy flavors and a heavy hand of oak.",US
5897,US,"The underlying wine shows real Santa Barbara Chard character of crispness and ripe, juicy fruit, with flavors of pineapples and peaches. But a huge, major flaw is excessive oakiness. All that caramel and butterscotch throws this otherwise likeable wine out of balance.",US
5898,US,"Simple and gluey, with canned tangerine and apricot flavors and an unnatural oaky taste.",US
5899,US,"Syrupy, with candied apricot flavors and a sugary finish.",US
5900,US,"From up in the Chalone highlands comes this very dry, acidic and rather earthy Chard. It has peach and apricot flavors, with a touch of green tea and tannins. Seems like it has the structure to age, although that has got to be considered a gamble.",US
5901,US,"This simple Chard has likeable, intense flavors of lemons and limes and other tropical fruits, such as guavas and nectarines. It's very dry, and the finish is rich in clean, bright, palate-stimulating acids.",US
5902,US,"Tart and minerally, this high-acid Chard has green apple pie flavors, sprinkled with cinnamon and nutmeg. It's bone dry, an angular, somewhat lean wine that needs food to show what it can do. Try with grilled salmon.",US
5903,US,"With peach custard, pineapple and smoky, oaky tastes, this is a good, satisfying Chard. It's dry and balanced in acidity, with a nice spiciness.",US
5904,US,"The winery specializes in single-vineyard wines, and this is certainly a unique Chardonnay, but it's not an opulent one. On the contrary, it's flinty, acidic and raspingly dry, which makes one think it was picked early. It's almost like a Sauvignon Blanc, with its puckery lemon flavors.",US
5905,US,"At three years, this Chard is losing some freshness, and is picking up a dried peach and apricot flavor. It's also softening, which emphasizes the creaminess. It's best to pop the cork on this dry wine now.",US
5906,US,"Very ripe, almost jammy in apricots, pineapples and pears, this Chard seems sweet, like sugared or honeyed pie-filling. The finish is a bit cloying.",US
5907,US,"Tastes like fruity soda pop or canned fruit syrup, with sugary pineapple and pear flavors. The oak is unnaturally sweet and strong.",US
5908,US,"Butter, pear and cinammon aromas preface tropical fruit on the palate. Feels round and medium-weight, with oak not so obvious until the finish. Even so, Winemaker Cara Morrison says that future vintages will show even less wood.",US
5909,US,"Nice and direct in ripe fruit and oak flavors, this is textbook proper Chardonnay. The flavors are of tropical fruits and spice, the texture is creamy, the finish is long and spicy.",US
5910,US,"Great price for a Chard of this quality. Dry, crisp and amply flavored in peaches and cream, tangerines and buttered toast, it has the richness of more costly wines.",US
5911,US,"Chard doesn't get any riper, unless it's late harvest. Floods the mouth with peach custard, pineapple, guava, nectarine and apple flavors, with a rich, creamy, oaky finish. It's a bit one-dimensional, but what a tasty dimension.",US
5912,US,"Rich and spicy Chardonnay, and while it's a little soft in acidity, there's luxury in the creamy texture. The flavors veer toward pineapples and peaches, with the vanilla and buttered toast of fine oak. An upscale Chard for shellfish.",US
5913,US,"Nasty and sharp, with candied LifeSaver flavors that have a weirdly medicinal, over-oaked taste.",US
5914,US,"This has a rich earthy quality, suggesting sweet heaps of mulch and herbs, in addition to fruitier flavors of apples and peaches. It's also somewhat soft and well-oaked. If you're looking for an example of Napa Chard, for better or  worse, this is a good one.",US
5915,US,"Parker's basic county Chardonnay shares the same features as his upper tier, namely a wonderful balance of acids, fruit, oak and alcohol. The flavors are of tropical fruits, although the wine is necessarily not as rich or concentrated as the single vineyards.",US
5916,US,"This is a tightly wound Chardonnay, crisp and steely. It's also oaky. The underlying flavors are of citrus and tropical fruits, buttered toast and vanilla, with a touch of metallic stone. Calls to mind the 2006. Give it a breath of air before serving to soften it, and don't drink it too cold.",US
5917,US,"This is a new line of fairly low-priced varieties from this venerable Napa winery. The Chardonnay, made from very ripe grapes, is good and rich in creamy fruit, with balancing acidity.",France
5918,US,"Shows many of the qualities of Chardonnay from this appellation, with high acidity and pure citrus fruit flavors. There's also a lot of new-oaky extract.",France
5919,US,"No oak here, so what you get is upfront acidity that makes for a direct, tart mouthfeel that frames lime, apple and peach flavors veering into pineapples. This is a simple, clean wine.",US
5920,US,"Here's a good, everyday Chard with plenty of fruit and cream flavor and a tangy, crisp mouthfeel. It does the California Chard thing at a fair price. From Stag's Leap Wine Cellars.",US
5921,US,"If you can get past the hard, faux-wax plastic seal, you'll find a sweetish wine, with peaches and cream flavors, and a spicy, honeyed finish.",US
5922,US,"Showing plenty of zesty acidity, this dry Chard has modest flavors of peaches and pineapples, wrapped into a creamy texture. It finishes quick and clean.",US
5923,US,"Dry and crisp in acidity, with butterscotchy new oak notes that frame flavors of apricots, lychee, pineapple, pear and papaya. Drink this delicious Chardonnay now.",US
5924,US,Simple and sweet. Tastes like lemonade.,US
5925,US,"Hat Trick is the best of the best of Morgan's estate vineyard, which is in the chilliest northwestern part of the Highlands. Acidity stars, giving the wine a brilliant crispness that's so clean and fine. Barrel fermented in one-third new French oak, the wine is incredibly rich and leesy. The terroir has coaxed out complex layers of pineapples, Meyer lemons, limes, apricots and very exotic tropical fruits suggesting golden mangoes and papayas. The oak adds even richer layers of crème brûlée to this vastly enjoyable wine.",US
5926,US,"The fruit is precise and fine-tuned, showing nuances of mixed green and yellow berries, citrus and stone fruits, along with a smooth vein of butterscotch from barrel aging in new French oak. A sophisticated debut that promises good things to come.",US
5927,US,"This is rich, ripe, fat and seemingly oaky. It may be too much of a good thing. Massive in caramelized, butterscotch, pineapple, peach, apricot, lime and cotton candy flavors, it might overpower any food you have it with. Almost better as a cocktail sipper.",US
5928,US,"Here's a good everyday Chard, offering immediate pleasure in the ripe tropical fruit and peach flavors, creamy texture and smoky oak influence. It's a blend of Russian River and Alexander Valley.",US
5929,US,"Bigger and richer than the Starmont bottling, with correspondingly heavier oak. Lots of toast and grilled pineapple and peach notes on the nose, followed by a mouthfilling wine laced with smoky accents. Echoes of butter and dark toast on the finish.",US
5930,US,"These high-acid grapes have made for a mouthwateringly crisp wine, with deliciously provocative flavors of high-toned citrus fruits, including oranges, and lots of vanilla and buttered toast. Clean, complex and satisfying.",US
5931,US,"Here's a really good Chardonnay: Crisp, delicate and dry, it shows great acidity and brilliant fruit, saturating the palate with pineapple tart, Key lime pie, vanilla cream, crème brûlée and cinnamon spice flavors. Finishes with the deliciously creamy, yeasty complexities of lees aging.",US
5932,US,"Past Chardonnays from this vineyard have been more opulent, and it's a curiosity why the winemaker shied away from ripeness this vintage, when it should have been easy. The absence of richness makes the acidity and alcohol stand out. It's a good wine, just something of a disappointment.",France
5933,US,"Oak and lees add extra layers of complex interest to this smooth wine. It has pretty flavors of apples, peaches and honeydew, and those Monterey acids are firm and bright. The finish is notable for its rich spices and length.",US
5934,US,"A clean, focused Chard, with tightly wound flavors of citrus fruits, apples and peaches. Oak adds notes of vanilla, buttered toast and smoke. Particularly nice for its crisp acids and firm balance.",US
5935,US,"Ripe and fruity, this tasty wine is filled with flavors of pears and pineapples, apples and peaches and a sprinkling of Oriental spices. It is well oaked and creamy smooth, with a long, fruity finish.",US
5936,US,"Almost as tight as the Aurora bottling, maybe a shade richer in pear fruit flavors. Still, it's a lean wine, a structural drink dominated by acids, alcohol and dusty tannins. Oak provides vanilla. The finish turns tart and earthy.",US
5937,US,"A rich, New World-style Chard with very ripe, forward fruity flavors of tangerine, apricot, and tropical fruits. Well-framed in oak, and with refreshingly crisp acids, this full-bodied wine is well-priced for the quality.",US
5938,US,"Great price for a Chardonnay of this quality. The grapes come from cool coastal areas, and the wine brims with crisp, long hangtime ripeness, accented with toasty oak. Feels rich and creamy, with pineapple, tropical fruit and vanilla flavors.",US
5939,US,"Offers a good modern interpretation of Chardonnay, with its ripe, oaky flavors and creamy texture. Grilled pineapples, mashed green pears, buttered toast, caramel and vanilla, brightened with crisp acidity.",US
5940,US,"From a vineyard that has a long track record of success with Chardonnay, this new entry is a bit sharp and toasty, perhaps just a bit young to be at its peak. The fruit flavors are light and bring green apple and melon into play; the oak tastes new and not yet well-integrated, but with time this should balance out.",US
5941,US,"Sharp and crisp in citrusy acidity, this Chard has jammy flavors of apricots, pineapples and vanilla oak. A little direct, but dry and creamy, and easy to drink.",US
5942,US,"Burnished gold in color, with aromas of custard, lemon curd, toast and baked apples. The flavor profile is an amalgam of dull pear and apple, while the finish is heavy as it deals coconut and tropical fruit. Overall it's a soft, fading Chardonnay that can be summed up in one taste.",US
5943,US,"This is a big, ripe Chard, well-oaked and brimming with spice and tropical fruit flavors. Plays to the popular taste for rich, creamy Chards that flood the mouth and last through a long finish. Try with lobster bisque.",US
5944,US,"The coolness of the site and the vintage has yielded a young, tart wine that fans of big, fat Chards might find lean and austere. But it's a grand wine for Burgundy lovers. Acidity is high, and there's a stony minerality undergirding the citrus, wildflower and smoky oak flavors. This is one of those rare Chards that needs some time to come around. Best 2008–2011.",US
5945,US,"Like the winery's other 2005 Chardonnays, this one, tasted in March, is tightly wound and minerally. The aroma will show little if the wine is too cold. Flavor-wise, hints of tart tangerines, lemongrass, green apples, candied ginger and vanilla cream swirl into a smoky oak, spicy finish. This is a Chardonnay that needs some time in the bottle. Drink now and for a couple of years.",US
5946,US,"Charry, smoky oak stars in this young, well-structured wine, leading to powerhouse peach pie (with the crust), lemon mousse and buttered toast flavors that finish long and spicy. Acidity is high, and gives a tangy minerality that adds complexity.",US
5947,US,"The golf legend lends his name to this everyday, simple Chard. It has fruity flavors and a creamy texture, with smoky notes, and is dry and balanced.",US
5948,US,"An exceptional value, this is buttery and round, loaded with peaches and creamy vanilla flavors. Solidly mainstream and quite delicious in a full-on, barrel-fermented, 100% malolactic style.",US
5949,US,"Very, very sweet in residual sugar, with powerful flavors of apricots, honey, oranges and vanilla. A bit soft, but the luscious sweetness is what makes it work.",US
5950,US,"Shows the bright acidity and citrus of the appellation, and is clean and dry, but could certainly use more fruity concentration.",US
5951,US,"Kind of heavy and dull, with earth and mineral flavors breaking into citrus and green apples. Finishes bone dry and tart in acids. Call it Chablisian.",US
5952,US,"The problem here is a lack of fruit. Except for a hint of Chardonnay peaches and cream, you get little beyond alcohol and acidity. But it's a clean wine.",US
5953,US,"Has most of the elements of a fine Monterey Chard. Keen acids and a lively, clean finish stimulate the tastebuds. The problem is a lack of fruit. The wine teases with peaches, then pulls back and fails to deliver.",US
5954,US,"A very nice Chardonnay that continues the winery's success with this bottling. Dry and creamy, it has rich flavors of pineapples, pears, vanilla and spices.",US
5955,US,"This succulent wine's bright, well-defined fruit flavors of pineapple, grapefruit and citrus add life and lift across the entire palate. The fruit is the star here, and whatever new oak has been applied has been used well. There is just the right touch of butterscotch and toasted almond on the finish, but the fruit keeps the flavors rolling through the back of the palate for a long, leisurely ride.",US
5956,US,"With a dash of oak for vanilla and crème brûlée seasoning, this is a very ripe, soft Chardonnay. The fruit flavors veer toward apricots and nectarines, and finish a bit sweet.",US
5957,US,"Soft, ripe and oaky, with flamboyant tropical fruit pastry flavors that are almost sugary sweet on the finish. There's good acidity to balance.",US
5958,US,"I get the idea of this wine. It's to craft a mountain Chard that's lean and acidic now, but a cellar candidate. It is indeed tight and austere, not offering a lot of satisfaction beyond oak and a hint of spicy pear on the finish. If you're adventurous, hold until 2006.",US
5959,US,"Right now my preference between Mondavi's Reserve and regular Chard is the regular. This is a better wine, from a classic Chablisian point of view, but it needs time. It's firm and deep in fruit, with an impressive minerality, and the balance for aging. Lay this Chardonnay down for two to four years as it gains some bottle complexity.",France
5960,US,"Plenty of flavor packed into this modest little blush, which smacks of ripe peaches and strawberries. A bit of sugar balances out the high acidity, leading to a soft, semi-sweet aftertaste.",US
5961,US,"There's a lot of crisp, vibrant acidity in this wine, which gives the pineapple, apricot and peach flavors a jamminess that lasts through the finish. With its creamy texture, it's a wine to drink now.",US
5962,US,"High in acidity, almost sour despite complete malo, this is a very dry wine, and it's thin in fruity flavor. Will do in a pinch, but you can do better for the money.",France
5963,US,Not much going on here besides alcohol and acidity. The fruit is thin and citrusy. A little Viognier adds modest floral notes.,US
5964,US,"Estancia owns some impressive vineyards in the Pinnacles region, but you'd never know it from this wine. It's watery, tasting of alcohol and acidity.",US
5965,US,"Here's a fat, unctuous, oily Chard, about as ripe as they come. Barrel fermented in all-new oak, it has an overlay of smoky char and caramelized vanilla riding over guava, nectarine and honeysuckle flavors. It sure is decadent.",US
5966,US,"Good everyday Chard, with pronounced peach, apple and pear flavors and more exotic notes of tropical fruits. Oak adds the smoke, vanilla and cream that round the wine off.",US
5967,US,"Lots of oak, lots of upfront ripe peach, pear and tropical fruit, that's pretty much the story with this widely available Chard. With more than 100,000 cases, it should be easy to find.",US
5968,US,"This creamy Chard has good varietal character, with pleasant peach, green apple and cinnamon spice flavors.",US
5969,US,"Tastes kind of thin and simple, with watery flavors of peaches, alcohol and oak that finish quick. But it's a clean, balanced wine.",US
5970,US,"Bitter oak, a sugary mouthfeel, and an earthy, chunky, pineapple candy-flavored palate.",US
5971,US,"Silky and crisp, with those long, penetrating Edna Valley flavors of ripe kiwis, Key lime pie and intense vanilla. Shows real elegance and flair, and this is a good price for the quality.",US
5972,US,"Ginger snap and graham cracker aromas share the field with golden apple, menthol and lemongrass on the nose. Winemaker Rob Hunter selects the best lots and crafts a tightly-meshed wine with persistence and a strong backbone. Pear, pineapple, vanilla and toasty oak linger on the palate. Has personality and closes with impressive length.",US
5973,US,"Another solid effort from Mondavi, the 1998 reserve shows fine structure and an attractive spectrum of citrus, peach, crème brulée and nut aromas and flavors that work in lovely harmony.  It's full but not heavy, and balances fruit and acidity, sweetness and tartness, and light and full elements. The positive fruit, style and restraint are notable.",US
5974,US,"This is a ripe pear-scented butterscotch-infused Chardonnay. The palate shows more ripe pear and melon flavors, along with lots of toasty new oak, which yields delicious hazelnut shadings. Soft and easy to enjoy, it closes long, and creamy-spicy.",US
5975,US,"This is a unique wine with an unusual and impressive bouquet of peach smoke, cocoa and hazelnut. Balanced but firm on the palate, it offers robust fruit and spice flavors and mint, toast and nut accents. There's even an intriguing kirsch-like cherry note in here. Full-bodied, it's a wine of real individual character that finishes dense, long and spicy.",US
5976,US,"The fragrant and flavorful nose's butter, lychee and banana aromas create an alluring opening. Pink grapefruit and tropical fruit flavors accent a sweetly spicy, baked-apple mouth that has medium weight and a nice texture. The wine finishes dry and nutty, with moderate length. Smoky and lush, it's ready to drink tonight.",US
5977,US,"A flamboyant bouquet of pineapple, ripe orange, floral, nuts and toasty oak opens to a full palate of orange, nectarine and pineapple flavors. Interesting accents including brown sugar, buttered popcorn and mineral notes provide great tension against the fruit. Round and full—if a touch soft—it closes with a long, refined spicy-nutty finish.",US
5978,US,"Apple and tropical fruit aromas accented by mint, grass and herbal notes open to an equally bright palate of pineapple, mango and citrus flavors. In this classy, medium-bodied Chardonnay, these lively elements meet buttery vanilla notes in the mouth and flow into a long caramel finish with brisk, pepper-oak accents.",US
5979,US,"Big and oaky, as Private Reserves always are, the '99 is a textbook toasty Chardonnay. Apple, peach and plum aromas and flavors are wrapped in a smooth, smoky cocoon. The rich and supple palate feel is a winner, the long finish still tight. Enjoyable already, but should be held for a few years.",US
5980,US,"Intriguing Asian spice, peanut brittle, pineapple and butter cream aromas comprise the bouquet of this round, well-integrated wine from Sonoma County's tiny Green Valley appellation. Everything flows smoothly into the lingering pineapple, butterscotch, pear and apple flavors in the finish. Top Value.",US
5981,US,"This Chardonnay, from a small vineyard block in Jess Jackson's Alexander Mountain estate, is grand yet graceful. Oozing pear, butterscotch, melon and menthol flavors, it shows good weight and a positive richness that's supported by firm structure. It's balanced, appealing, admirably not overoaked and finishes long with flavors of melon, spice and pear offset by toasty accents. Top Value.",US
5982,US,"This seductive, creamy Chard wraps smoky, spicy, vanilla-laden oak flavors around a core of lush tropical fruit. There's lively acidity and a lot to like here. The finish shows a slight edge that may smooth out in another three or four months.",US
5983,US,"One of two Byron bottlings from this source; this one should be less difficult to find in stores. The dry apple and pear fruit flavors are bolstered by crisp acidity, refreshing mineral accents and earthy elements. This is a chewy, mouthfilling wine with richly textured palate feel. The long finish is tangy with citrus, cinnamon and mineral components.",US
5984,US,"Jed Steele's wines turned in impressive performances in this tasting—as in this full-bodied, well-integrated and elegant wine from the respected Sangiacomo Vineyard in Carneros. Tropical fruit, butterscotch, lemon and hops flavors caress the nose and palate, supported nicely by an acid spine. Creamy yet firm, the mouthfeel is admirable. The wine sports a stylish, mildly spicy finish. Top Value.",US
5985,US,"Fine flavor definition and very good acidity. Citrus, apple and herb aromas sing on the nose. Round apple, anise and pineapple show on the velvety palate. The wine finishes with a pretty melding of pineapple and vanilla, like an elegant tropical creamsicle. Enticing, but still tight enough to warrant holding it for a year or two.",US
5986,US,"Like autumn in a bottle, the subdued smoke and pear bouquet is followed by a buttered apple, toast and vanilla palate. The flavors are more understated than they sound—this wine is all about subtlety and balance. It builds in layers, complex and butter-smooth. The standout finish shows butterscotch and mineral notes in a delightful tension.",US
5987,US,"A pale gold color belies the full, deep aromas and flavors this wine offers. The lively, multifaceted nose highlights orange, pear, ginger snaps, anise and caramel notes. It opens to a rich, even palate that shows similar flavors and a smooth, buttery feel. The pleasing finish displays plenty of toast, vanilla and spice, and an impressive dry, leesy aftertaste.",US
5988,US,"Four different clones are separately fermented and then blended to make this unique bottling. An expansive nose shows vibrant pineapple, peach, and orange fruit with lemondrop and butterscotch accents. It's rich and mouthfilling, like a bite of banana cream pie, and turns maybe a bit orangey-sweet. Shy on subtlety, it packs in a lot of juicy flavor.",US
5989,US,"Apple, pear, coconut and chalk mark the bouquet of this smooth yet crisp and brisk wine from the Napa microproducer. Lime, pineapple and apricot with oak and cinnamon shadings are in play on the rich, viscous palate and flow beautifully through to the finish. Though full, the wine never gets weighty. It closes light on its feet, long and tangy, with lemon, cream and oak accents.",US
5990,US,"If you like piña coladas and getting caught in the—oh…I mean…coladas and ripe banana, caramel and pear aromas and flavors, then this wine delivers. There's an undeniable coconut quality here, and nice acid zip that keeps the fruit in the mix. The oak tannins need a bit of time to smooth out—they're a little edgy on the back end.",US
5991,US,"Heavy clove and cinnamon-spice notes grace the nose of this very limited single-vineyard offering. Honey, stone and a nuttiness mark the nose. Ripe and lively pineapple, banana, lime and grapefruit flavors shine nicely in a medium-weight, well-balanced style. Finishes long and tart. A year or two in the bottle will bring out more complexity.",US
5992,US,"A pear, apple-orange and earth bouquet sets the stage for a palate chockful of pineapple, pear and lemon flavor. Toast notes offset and vibrant acidity uplifts the fruit nicely. The finish is long and tart-sweet with complex leesy, earthy notes. Medium-bodied and restrained, this complex wine shows depth. Give it six months to a year to unfold.",US
5993,US,"The rich bouquet shows buttery, creamy vanilla notes with hints of tarragon and sweet hay. Golden apple and pear wears sweet butterscotch on the medium-weight, soft palate. Shows a bit of alcoholic heat as well as good intensity and impressive weight, but a one taster found it too controlled by vanillin oak qualities at the expense of the fruit.",US
5994,US,"Fermented with native yeast, this estate wine from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir pioneer Josh Jensen is classy, earthy and firm. Apple and yellow plum flavors mingle with mineral elements on the palate. It finishes nutty and tart, with good length and a solid acid spine. One of the few California wines that are Burgundian in spirit, this is still tight. Although it was one of the oldest wines we tasted, it can still use a few years to fully unfold.",US
5995,US,"Helen Turley's Chardonnay shows nice complexity, particularly on the nose, where nuanced oriental spice, tobacco, nectarine, floral and yellow fruit aromas play with the senses. The palate is mild and balanced, with melon, stone fruit and nut flavors, and a smooth texture to boot. Just a touch of heat shows on the long, dry yet spicy finish.",US
5996,US,"With its 90% Napa and 10% Sonoma lineage, this wine serves up mild lime, butterscotch and green apple aromas and a nicely weighted palate with tropical fruit, peach and caramel flavors. The mouthfeel is soft, with a caramel custard quality. The long, creamy and toasty finish will win raves from lovers of both the full malolactic and well-oaked styles.",US
5997,US,"Tasty hazelnut overtones to the apple and cinnamon aromas mark the nose of this elegant wine. Toasted almond, pear and caramel flavors work in harmony. Good acidity and all-around stylish restraint make it a great food wine.",US
5998,US,"Pear, pineapple and citrus aromas with spearmint accents comprise the bouquet of this Russian River favorite. The wine is round and soft with tea, lemon, tropical fruit and buttercream flavors. It's light- to medium- weight, but with enough complexity to hold the taster's interest, and a persistent, tangy, sweet and sour back-end fade.",US
5999,US,"Complex leesy, smoky, nutty aromas adorn the nose of this racy wine. It displays a citrusy tartness and lime, green apple, vanilla and wintergreen accents that linger refreshingly. Finishes with unusual apple, nut and burnt sugar aromas and flavors. A Mendocino appellation wine from Jim Clendenon, the notorious ‘Mind Behind' Santa Barbara County's Au Bon Climat Winery.",US
6000,US,"This opens with a muted but very pleasing nose of orange, pineapple, clove, almond and baked apple aromas. The palate's tropical fruit is complemented by butterscotch, clove and allspice flavors. Soft but well-constructed, it's a medium-weight wine with balanced fruit and well-utilized oak on the finish.",US
6001,US,"Strong in every sense, with ripe pineapple, lemon and peach flavors and strong oak. Lacks subtlety, but it's crisp in acidity and shows a nice streak of minerals. Ready now.",US
6002,US,"From the old vine planting, this is a thick, chunky, fruity style, with banana and light tropical fruit flavors. Firm acidity and grip give it a substantial mouthfeel.",US
6003,US,"This is a big, rich, showy Chardonnay. Barrel fermented and aged in 80% new French oak, it shows buttered toast and charry vanilla bean aromas and flavors. The fruit below is good, if a little heavy and ripe, suggesting apricots and pears. Best now in its youth.",US
6004,US,"Here's a good, rich and super-drinkable Chardonnay. It shows oak-inspired flavors of pineapples, peaches and green apples that taste like they were baked into a pie. Finishes clean and zesty in acidity.",US
6005,US,"Very rich, creamy and oaky, made in the ripe, California style of Chardonnay. Brims with buttered toast, vanilla cream, and caramelized wood aromas and flavors riding over underlying pineapples, pears and limes. Flamboyant, if a little top-heavy. Ready now.",US
6006,US,"A brisk, clean Chardonnay with a firm footing of minerals undergirding polished pineapple, pear and cedar flavors. Offers lots of sophisticated pleasure at a good price.",US
6007,US,"To this taster, there's so much high-char new oak on this Chard that it goes beyond toast all the way to burnt ash. Too bad, because the underlying wine is crisp and ripe in polished tropical fruit.",US
6008,US,"Give this youthful wine some time to settle down. Tasted in late March, its parts had yet to mesh. The acidity, oakiness and fresh grapy flavors are at some odds with each other. By winter of 2007, it should be a fine, complex Chardonnay, and drink well for five years.",US
6009,US,"I liked Morgan's Double L Chard for its Chablis-like character. This wine is more so. It's drier, more acidic and more elegant, but there's nothing lean about the power of its core of tropical fruit, which detonates on the palate and doesn't stop. There's fascination with every sip, as the wine slowly changes in the glass. This is a great wine and showcases the infinite possibilities of this appellation.",US
6010,US,"This is hefty, dry and structured Chardonnay. Offers a complex musky, creamy nose that ushers in a range of tart citrus, coconut, toasted nut and mineral flavors. The smoky finish also shows a crisp, almost hard-edged metallic note. Stylized and appealing, but still tight—should be better in a year or two.",US
6011,US,"Aromas of ripe cantaloupe, vanilla and tropical fruits plus creamy malolactic notes show on the nose of this limited-production Napa Chardonnay. This offering, a distinct label from the proprietors of Far Niente, has apple, pear and white peach flavors. Expect caramel and nut accents on a smoothly textured, buttery palate. The finish is long and dry—you'll see a reprise of the nutty elements plus a hint of lime.",US
6012,US,"Announces itself with an unusual and pleasant Gewürtztraminer-like tangerine, lychee and ginger nose. Its mild but decidedly unique character is clearer on the melon, butter-cinnamon and peach palate. Nice acidity and a tangy-spicy finish.",US
6013,US,"In good vintages, Trefethen reserves a special portion of their Chardonnay production for late release in their Library Selection series. This latest offering—one of the oldest wines tasted—shows good balance and creamy, yet still crisp, smoothness. The green apple fruit is still holding well, along with a chalky note and a refreshing lime, herb and flinty tartness reminiscent of Chablis.",US
6014,US,"Refined and inviting, the bouquet offers caramel, hazelnuts and toast. Dark apple, toast, spice and earth flavors fill the mouth. The mouthfeel is rich and dense, though a touch more fruit would really have it singing. Finishes with spice and faint lime notes, and a toasty oak flavor that really takes over. The former Deutz Champagne estate in San Luis Obispo County, Laetitia is now devoted to producing Chardonnay and Pinot Noir.",US
6015,US,"This Carneros Chardonnay shows solid mainstream style. Apple, caramel and mint aromas on the nose open to apple, coconut and menthol-oak flavors. The mouthfeel is full, though some tasters thought more big than full. Toasty new oak takes the lead, and a touch of heat shows on the back end.",US
6016,US,"Notes of smoke, toast, lime and herbs play against guava, pear and brown sugar scents in the bouquet. A chalk note accents zesty orange, grapefruit and guava flavors and a soft mouthfeel. Vanilla, clove and oak highlights mark the wine's creamy, medium-length finish.",US
6017,US,"This is an impressive bottling with complex caramel, toasted nut and tropical fruit aromas. It's big bodied and coats the mouth with rich butterscotch, banana, apple and toasty oak flavors. A touch short on acid, it could use bit more backbone, but it's still big on toasty style. Its long, satisfying finish is an oak lover's paradise.",US
6018,US,"This big, brawny Chardonnay's potent nose of smoke, hay, orange, banana and pungent lees is an attention-grabber. Baked apple, buttered popcorn, and vanilla flavors come on strong along with an edge of spicy oak that carries through the finish. The panel rendered a split decision on this wine from veteran winemaker David Ramey. It showed harmony, length and finesse to some, but appeared edgy, a bit disjointed and obvious to others.",US
6019,US,"This blend of 35% Sonoma, 33% Santa Barbara and 32% Monterey grapes shows the intensity and depth of flavor that careful grape selection and knowledgeable blending can achieve. The wine is full and forward, with mango, pear, pineapple, popcorn and very toasty oak boldly coating the palate. Just a touch unsubtle, it's still very delicious, and finishes with butterscotch and nutmeg.",US
6020,US,"Tastes like harvest in Hawaii. Toasted marshmallow, coconut and sunny tropical fruit notes hula on the opulent nose. A medium-weight palate of rich and warm, very comfortable flavors—apple cider, spice and earth—follows. A tangy, spicy finish makes you wish it were a touch longer.",US
6021,US,"Rich opening aromas of pineapple, pear and lime plus toast and leesy accents open to a round palate of sweet pear, apple, vanilla and pineapple flavors. This nicely balanced, medium-weight wine is smooth, but the new wood really dominates the lengthy close.",US
6022,US,"Thyme and lavender notes mingle with orange, tangerine and banana aromas and flavors in this exotic, stylized wine. An ample dose of spicy new oak brings dimension, but also adds a dry, slightly austere note to the long finish. Appealing now; may integrate better with short-term cellaring.",US
6023,US,"The green apple and menthol toast bouquet shows some unusual tobacco-like aromas that are usually associated with red wines. A sip reveals mint, apple and caramel flavors on a full, oaky frame. Nicely balanced and still tight, it ends with slightly subdued but persistent caramel and toast flavors. Previous vintages of this Santa Barbara classic have performed well—often better—after cellaring. Try in two years.",US
6024,US,"A presently reined-in wine with exotic elements, showing a ginger, saffron and green apple bouquet. It's well-balanced, with lively apple and citrus flavors. It has good acidity and a firm structure that should hold it together for three or four years. With aging, it may integrate and develop further.",US
6025,US,"The bouquet is like an aromatic walk in the woods—it has pine, earth and floral elements as well as the expected fruit aromas. Red apple and plum flavors are accented by lemon-lime the mouth, and a mineral note asserts itself. It has body but not weight, and closes with a clean citrus-chalk finish.",US
6026,US,"Very ripe tropical fruits and appealing pear, apple and spice notes show well in this nicely balanced wine. Good acidity plays a solid supporting role here. The toasty oak holds the almost overripe fruit in check—it's strong from the mid palate through the handsome butter-and-apple finish.",US
6027,US,"This barrel-fermented Chardonnay shows smoky new oak and telltale matchstick leesy aromas. Real spiciness comes through on the palate. The apple fruit wears strong clove, nutmeg and butterscotch notes. There's a firm acid backbone that's lively, but slightly jarring to some tasters. Give this one four to six months to knit itself together.",US
6028,US,"The complex smoke, earth, spice and mineral aromas that open this wine are followed by subdued tangerine and citrus flavors, dried spice and mineral accents on an oaky frame. Like the other Mt. Carmel Vineyard offerings, this is a bit tight now but has a promising, good balance. Not a fruit-driven wine, this finishes long with spice and mineral elements. Only 86 cases produced.",US
6029,US,"Opens with a lovely bouquet of lemon and tart pineapple fruit with anise, mineral and tobacco accents. The lemony note resurfaces on the pear, white peach and green apple palate. A chalk element adds interest and balances the overall zingy, bright tone in this tangy, high-alcohol wine.",US
6030,US,"Mint, fresh fruit and decidedly floral aromas led to yet another split-decision wine you may just have to taste yourself. Some tasters found elegance, white stone fruits, citrus and good acidity leading to a rich, silky finish with buttery and nutty notes. Others (same bottle!) found it soft, sweet and a bit cloying in a “your auntie's perfume” manner. Strange, but true…we can't make this stuff up.",US
6031,US,"This estate vineyard wine's complex nose melds mineral, spice and lime aromas with herb and floral notes. It handles the disparate elements gracefully, showing body but not weight, and has a soft, almost tender mouthfeel. There's a touch of floral sweetness in the mouth—as on the nose—offset by earthy, mineral flavors on a lithe frame. This wine shows real subtlety, but leaves us wishing for more depth. Finishes light, dry and flinty.",US
6032,US,"A lively citrus tang balances the rounder fig, melon, toast and dried spice flavors that predominate here. Finishes evenly with medium length. It seems to be at its peak, so drink this round and well-integrated Chardonnay up now.",US
6033,US,"Smooth and creamy from start to finish, this wine is a dead-on mainstream pleaser. Begins with a nutty and toasty nose that also shows traces of apple and lemon. The palate, buttressed by a healthy dose of oak, also offers a lot of fruit flavor, including pear and lemon, without being overly sweet. The bouquet's creamy and nutty notes reappear on the supple back end.",US
6034,US,"A touch of mint graces the tropical fruit-laden nose of this respected Monterey bottling. Fruit driven yet taut, the orange, pineapple, apple and herbal notes here show an earth-and-mineral complexity without the common overt oakiness. If you are fan of less-overtly oaked wines, this is a medium-weight, stylish offering with personality and fine balance.",US
6035,US,"A very tasty, fruity, slightly sweet style It's front-loaded and fruit-loaded, but good value and good taste.",US
6036,US,"A very nice cocktail wine for its dryness and crispness. Although it's Chardonnay, it's not a big, rich wine, but a sleek, bone-dry one, with citrus and mineral flavors and strong acidity. A dash of Viognier adds an exotic, flowery note.",US
6037,US,"Pretty oaky, with vanilla, buttered toast and charred wood aromas and tastes dominating. Under that are grilled pineapples and peaches, balanced with fine, tart acids. A little off around the edges, but a promising Chardonnay grown in this coastal L.A. climate.",US
6038,US,"The Conner Lee and Stillwater vineyards provided the grapes, which were fermented with native yeast and kept in 35% new French and 65% once-used barrels. The wine has retained plenty of natural acid and is showing quite a lot of buttery, new oak flavors. The fruit is solid, ripe and full, but one dimensional.",US
6039,US,"Opens with peach and apricot aromas, then turns fruity and simple, with a dryish, creamy mouthfeel.",US
6040,US,"Nice, dry and complex, a crisp wine with quite a bit of minerality undergirding the fruit and oak. Feels fine and balanced in the mouth, and should take a couple years in the cellar.",US
6041,US,"This is a new brand for me, and they're off to a promising start with this dry, minerally Chardonnay. It packs a punch with upfront lemon and lime, passion fruit and pineapple flavors that are pushed forward by great acidity, while oak adds a fine appliqué. This wine is notable for its balance, elegance and sheer deliciousness.",US
6042,US,"Smells a little funky, with a meaty, raw beef aroma on top of scents of green apples. Tastes thin and watery, with a suggested of appley citrus fruit flavor. The finish turns tart and dry.",France
6043,US,"Bizarre and unripe. Aromas of canned peaches with a strong note of the veggies, especially asparagus. The oaky overlay feels unnatural, with disembodied smoke and char flavors. Tart and acidic, and that vegetal taste returns to haunt the finish.",US
6044,US,"Vegetal and herbal, with disageeable aromas of canned white asparagus. Tastes a little better than it smells, but hardly like a Chardonnay. Flavors are citrusy, and the wine is lean and tart.",US
6045,US,"Attractive pear, citrus, melon and mild spice aromas open this lean and elegant wine. The mouthfeel is light, but not insubstantial and slightly tense (in a good way), showing good acid spine, crisp citrus flavors and taut mineral accents. A slight creaminess keeps it from getting too sharp, and it closes with a nice chalky note. Has the stuff to keep and may well merit a higher score with a few years of aging.",US
6046,US,"Susie Selby's homage to her late father has some sulfur and earthy notes on the nose, but there's good fruit behind. This full-bodied, nicely textured Chardonnay has nutty, smoky and spicy flavors melding with tangy tropical fruit to create a tasty, fairly lush wine that's easy to enjoy. Finishes soft, with a faint whiff of petrol—in the Alsace manner—and is drinking well now.",US
6047,US,"Aromas of movie popcorn, hops and Asian pear open this rather over-the-top wine. It's a decidedly candy-sweet combination of butterscotch, peach and nut flavors with a soft, round mouthfeel. The light orange finish is easy. If you have good friends who just don't like dry wines, this is a great one to serve them.",US
6048,US,"Citrus, pineapple, white stone fruits and green apple are among the aromas and flavors in this clean, medium-weight offering. The wine has a nice butterscotch streak, but some tasters found it light to the point of insubstantial, while others praised its balance and elegance.",US
6049,US,"Smoky, heavy toasted oak complements mild tropical fruit, nuts and coconut on the nose. The toasty flavor and a decidedly earthy note reads big against the pineapple, citrus and rich vanilla notes showing in the palate of this even, medium-weight wine. Finishes dry, brisk and slightly tart.",US
6050,US,"The bouquet offers dazzling aromas, including pineapple, banana, cinnamon, nutmeg, roasted nuts and butter. On the palate, the wine becomes more focused: taut pear, citrus and golden apple flavors closely wrapped in a tasty butterscotch and toast cocoon. Finishes long and even; could still use six months to a year to unwind.",US
6051,US,"The historic estate's 1998 is characteristically lean, angular and fairly closed. The bouquet of apple cider, anise, and fragrant jasmine-like notes opens to a trim palate of green apple and toast flavors, and a taut mouthfeel. Tart apple and oak, plus a flinty, mineral element play on the finish. Notoriously tight when young, this wine often opens incredibly with cellaring.",US
6052,US,"Tasters pegged apples, anise, crème brûlée and cinnamon in the lively nose of this rich wine—one that also sparked some controversy. The straight-ahead flavor profile is appealing, with solid apple, clove and butterscotch offset by the attractive anise streak. But is it native yeast or heavy malolactic fermentation that's responsible for the mixed feelings some panelists expressed? Concerns were noted about a dairy-like note on the nose and also a slick, yet gummy texture. Nevertheless, the winning aromas and flavors kept the overall take positive.",US
6053,US,"Another one of Jed Steele's many single-vineyard offerings this wine from Santa Barbara is big and perfumey. Pineapple, banana and caramel flavors are cloaked in sweetness that may be a bit heavy for some.",US
6054,US,"Restraint and elegance are not what you usually find in a Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay, but this one offers tart apple, citrus, and peach flavors along with a dose of toasty new oak. Clean and understated style.",US
6055,US,"We enjoyed the vanilla, pear, butter and toasty flavors on this classy Chard, but the high alcohol it contains almost does it in. The nice acid backbone holds it together though and leaves a good overall impression. Enjoy it with grilled seafood.",US
6056,US,"Lavishly oaked from the first whiff on the nose and palate, dense toasty notes envelope the pineapple and tropical fruit. Plenty of vanilla and both a tangy nuttiness and a creaminess from the oak, provide a nice mouthfeel tension. Panelists had two schools of thought about this wine: The oak totally dominates—certainly now—and how you feel about that determines your take on the wine. Lacking fruit? Or just tight and needing a year or two to open? Only time will tell.",US
6057,US,"This sunny, medium-gold wine opens with caramel and apple aromas. More candy apple-like flavors appear in the mouth, accompanied by tropical fruit and toasty accents with a rich caramel tone. It verges on too-sweet, but it's nonetheless pleasing in an uncomplicated way.",US
6058,US,"This light and elegant wine opens with orange and mild tropical fruit aromas. Easy peach and pear flavors bear dry vanilla and toasty oak accents. Even and soft on the palate, the nutty-leesy-chalky finish brings the wine to a pleasing close.",US
6059,US,"Pear, pineapple and herb aromas intrigued some tasters, but others found an odd note in this wine's nose. Vanilla, pear, apple and sweet spices mark the medium-weight and round palate. The back end of this wine has tangy wood and a slight chalkiness.",US
6060,US,"This Chard displays a slightly unusual but appealing sweet and sour streak. The bouquet shows tart green apples, grapefruit, stewed fruit and sweet herbs, plus tangy green oak shadings. The palate delivers more of the same, with zingy citrus and crisp apple flavors, but also dry, leesy notes. There's both cream and pepper on the back end of this likeable, split-personality wine.",US
6061,US,"The bouquet of Farrell's wine is a mixed bag of buttered popcorn, minerals, herbs, citrus fruit, pineapple and melon stuffed in an oak envelope. Similarly attractive flavors mark the palate, which is fairly full and has an almost rustic quality. Has all the body and length you could want, if not quite all the balance and finesse.",US
6062,US,"Some very appealing apple, asian pear, mint, smoke and toast notes mark the nose of this even, medium-weight wine. It has fine fruit-to-acid balance and offers apple-peach flavors with a mild but evident butterscotch element. The tangy oak that's present from the start shows most prominently on the spicy finish.",US
6063,US,"A full and creamy bouquet announces a palate laden with ripe golden delicious apple, vanilla, and melon flavors, with chalk, mineral and earth elements. The dry finish carries some length and builds in intensity. A straightforward wine that's ready to drink right now.",US
6064,US,"This Napa Valley mainstay's offering shows a firm acid backbone and crisp, bright green apple flavors with lemony accents. Overall a bit on the lean side, but it shows just a hint of butteriness and some tangy new oak spice on the long, tart finish.",US
6065,US,"The full fresh-bread aromas of yeast, honey, oats promise much body, but the palate delivers a dry citrus-mineral mouthful of flavors. Mouthfeel is dry and briskly acid—but with a nice chalky note, too. Chalk shows again on the finish, where it somewhat checks the sharp lemony-metallic notes.",US
6066,US,"Big and easy with caramel and creamy notes to spare, this has good apple, spice and toast elements and an appealing nutty-leesy aspect. Still, it seems already quite mature, like it needs to be drunk now. Enjoy it soon for its full mouthfeel and ripe baked apple flavors.",US
6067,US,"From the smoky, spicy nose through the spicy apple notes in the mouth, this bottling has an intriguing earth and mineral streak from start to finish. Medium-bodied, the wine offers some lemon and mineral tang and a lot of smoky oak on the finish.",US
6068,US,"This very rare, single-vineyard Chardonnay has distinct vanilla, golden delicious apple, banana and peach flavors—a nice mix of sweet and sour, but some tasters found searing acidity and a sharp metallic note. Finishes tart, dry and long with a bracing edge capable of cutting right through your fried calamari and spicy sauce. Only 132 cases produced.",US
6069,US,"A big nose of toasty oak, vanilla and butterscotch opens this offering. There are hints of pear and apple fruit, but the palate has a dominating oakiness and a custardy fatness. It's slightly hot, with dominant butterscotch and vanillin oaky flavors.",US
6070,US,"Respected vineyard source and established record of the winemaker notwithstanding, the dense gunpowder/matchstick quality here isn't easy to take—or even read. It is stylized, and big (we can sense suppressed tropical fruit and earthy, mineral notes below the veneer). Hidden treasure…or just rough stuff?",US
6071,US,"Apple and pear, cracker and citrus, pineapple and a hint of residual sugar combine in a soundly made, all-purpose Chardonnay. The alcohol is just under 13%, and the wine was not put through malolactic fermentation, leaving it crisp and fresh.",US
6072,US,"Rich and flamboyant in ultraripe pineapple jam, butterscotch and vanilla flavors, this Chard leaves little to the imagination. It has direct appeal for deliciousness.",US
6073,US,"Fruity and forward, with jammy apricot, pear, pineapple and vanilla cream flavors, girded with a tang of minerals. Grown on the Sonoma side of Carneros.",US
6074,US,"Unctuous and deep gold in color, this ripe, supersaturated wine is loaded with a sensuous mix of tropical and stone fruits, from peach and melon to tangerine and papaya. The acids manage to keep up, lifting what might otherwise turn flabby, and the wine continues to unfold with streaks of caramel and white chocolate. It's a decadent take on Chard, but well done, and definitely made for near-term drinking.",US
6075,US,"Clean enough, but not much going on in this dry, thin Chard. It has watery, vaguely Chardonnay-like flavors and is acidic.",US
6076,US,"Call it Chablisian for its high acidity and dry minerality, with suggestions of herbs and mushrooms that create a deep undertow to the brighter peach and pineapple flavors. This is a powerful, very complex wine, easily able to handle its share of new French oak.",US
6077,US,"Here's a polished, delicate wine that shows the poise and elegance that Carneros Chard can achieve. It's varietally pure, with pineapple, mineral and toast flavors that finish dry, a wine meant to enjoy with food, rather than star on its own. Easy to find, with 31,000 cases produced.",US
6078,US,"They didn't let any malolactic fermentation into this wine, a wise decision because you wouldn't want it to be any softer. Still, there's a prettiness to the ripe green apple, honey and toast flavors, which are complexed with layers of tropical fruits, spices and lees.",US
6079,US,"The pleasant nose of nuts, green apples and caramel also shows an odd whiff that mattered more to some tasters than others. Light apple fruit, spice, earth and butterscotch notes play on the full, but vaguely sour milk-tinged palate. Finishes tart and dry with slight mineral notes, in the manner of some white Burgundies. We've been big fans of Foxen's wines in the past, but this one left us scratching our heads.",US
6080,US,"This wine cuts a racy Chablis-like profile. Green apple and lemon-lime fruit, mild spices and a dry earthiness are all in play here. They ride on brisk acidity through a tart and minerally finish. A thoroughbred wine that, to some, “lacks stuffing.”",US
6081,US,"Some panelists praised this Chardonnay's balance and zingy citrus flavors; others were put off by its potent, even overwhelming, oak and green woody aspects. It's full-bodied, and there are pleasant pear, lime and butterscotch notes fighting for space on the palate. Give it a year or two and judge for yourself.",US
6082,US,"The nose here shows clean pine and citrus notes, with accents of herb and tropical fruit. Straightforward apple, pear and nut flavors show on the palate. In some ways, including the nutty finish, the wine is good—in other ways, it's just there.",US
6083,US,"Slightly odd-scented nose with hints of pipe tobacco, grapefruit, green apple and herbs. Better on the palate with green pear, faint apple, pineapple and herbal notes in a tart, lean framework. Pleasant hints of oak show up on the finish.",US
6084,US,"The nutty, smoky notes on the nose are overshadowed by taut, high-octane alcohol-mineral scents. The stony, mineral-laden palate also shows earthy, apple-oatmeal flavors. The mouthfeel is full, yet tight (we could say ripe, but it's not fruit-driven wine). This unusual offering fades long but closed, with hints of spice and coffee. Previous tastings of Mt. Carmel have proved it a tough read when young. Hold and taste in three years.",US
6085,US,"The nose here delivers a hefty dose of meaty, smoky, nutty notes paired with mild pear and apple. The palate doesn't show complexity—a pronounced toasted oak rides hard on apple and pineapple fruit. It's balanced and finishes dry, but comes up wanting the desired texture and nuance.",US
6086,US,"Lean and tautly balanced, this wine has an outdoorsy, mineral-and-hay bouquet and sweet herbal accents. Green apple flavors take over the palate, though hints of lemon and minerals also show up. Tasters didn't find anything terribly wrong here, just a lack of element that would make it more right. Finishes with lingering oaky notes.",US
6087,US,"Crème brûlée and baked apple aromas on the nose open to a smooth palate of mild apple, pineapple and spice flavors with citrus accents.The flavors aren't vibrant, though, and the intensity of the oak rendered the faint fruit nearly invisible.",US
6088,US,"There's still a good and pleasant dose of pineapple and apple fruit accented by vanilla spice in this wine, but a mature and overly soft palate-feel suggests that it's best consumed near-term. Finishes smooth and light, with medium length. Drink up this year.",US
6089,US,"Opens with a nice nose of roasted nuts, banana, caramel and a hint of smoke. The palate's pear, baked apple and apricot flavors wear interesting coconut accents, but all these are unfortunately overrun by a scotch notes peek out from behind an edgy acidity.",US
6090,US,"The deep gold color here suggests age, as do the soft, vaguely oxidized flavors. Still, it shows some nice vanilla and baked apple notes, as well as slight chalk accents, on its toasty oak frame. Drink now.",US
6091,US,"Asian pear, but also dairy-like notes of cheese, sour cream and show on the nose. The mouthfeel is a bit heavy. Apple and woody flavors show on the palate; dry wood and spice mark the back end. A good wine, but now reading ponderously—perhaps past its prime.",US
6092,US,"Offers an attractive nose of white peach, pear, lime and anise, but fails to come through with much substance on the palate. Simple and buttery-slick in the mouth, it shows some spicy notes but not much else, and turns a bit hot on the finish.",US
6093,US,"Made in the modern, ripe California stlyle, this Chardonnay offers immediately appealing flavors of pineapple jam, peach, lime, kiwi and vanilla oak. It's balanced with crisp acidity. Ready now for sheer richness.",US
6094,US,"With 9% residual sugar, this Chardonnay is distinctly sweet. It's also very Chard-like, with pear, peach and buttercream flavors. It's a bit simple, but very tasty.",US
6095,US,"A very nice, super-drinkable Chardonnay marked by brisk, cool-climate acidity and a bracing minerality. The pineapple, peach and apple flavors have the slight herbality you often find in Napa Chardonnay.",US
6096,US,"Fresh and vibrant, with crisp acidity brightening pineapple, golden apricot, lime and pear flavors. There's a bit of oak, but the fruit really stars in this savory young Chard.",US
6097,US,"Rochioli's estate Chard, as opposed to their single-vineyard or block bottlings, needs a really stellar year to shine. It's a very good wine, with crisp mineral, date and pineapple flavors, but lacks the richness and complexity that come with warmer vintages.",US
6098,US,"Weak and vegetal, with just the barest note of Chardonnay juice, this is a pretty forgettable wine.",US
6099,US,"What a roll St. Jean has been on with Chardonnay. This wine was made from a majority of Robert Young and Belle Terre vineyard fruit, and is two-thirds new French oak. The combination is mind-blowing. The vineyards contribute concentrated spicy, tropical fruit flavors and perfect acid balance, while the oak provides elaborate seasoning. Absolutely delicious. One of the most satisfying Chards of the vintage.",US
6100,US,"This year's Rosemary's is dry, crisp in citrusy acids, and wonderfully complex. It shows fresh, sweet pineapple fruit and spicy overtones of cinnamon and nutmeg along with layers of minerals and dried herbs. Easily takes its place in the front ranks of California Chardonnay.",US
6101,US,"Acidity and minerals are the hallmarks of this exciting Chardonnay. Of course, you'll find the ripe tropical fruit and new oak and lees of other Chardonnays, but it's really that tanginess that attracts. Currently the wine shows primary flavors of mangoes and papayas, but it would not surprise me if it ages well beyond five years.",US
6102,US,"A little softer than K-J's Camelot Highlands, but no less delicious, with similar lemon drop and custard flavors and a tinge of sweet, ripe pear. The mouthfeel is round, creamy and full-bodied, with a complex veneer of toasty oak.",US
6103,US,"What's so nice about this wine is that it has full-throttle Chard personality while keeping everything so balanced that it's also a versatile food wine. You can't say that about a lot of Chardonnays. Mainly it's the acidity, but also the complex, subtle interplay of fruit and oak. A very nice job.",US
6104,US,"Comprised of 100% estate-grown grapes and barrel fermented in new French oak, this is Woodward Canyon's premier Chardonnay. The richness of the oak almost overpowers the nose, but when one thinks of premier cru Burgundy it's hard to tell the difference. In the mouth, the fruit more than holds its own, with firm acids and plenty of ripe peach and apricot flavors. Additional time in bottle is needed to soften the hard edges. Just 143 cases made.",US
6105,US,"Very rich and ripe, showing pineapple tart and oak-infused vanilla, meringue and buttered toast aromas and flavors. A bit lacking in structure, though, with a soft, melted mouthfeel. Could be firmer and crisper to balance all that decadence.",US
6106,US,"Hamacher is one of the founding members of the Oregon Chardonnay Alliance (ORCA), and this wine is a shining example of what heights Oregon Chardonnay can achieve. Smoky and nutty at first, it opens to reveal white peach and melon flavors that gradually supplant the oak notes. Richly textured and full-bodied, it also boasts serious length on the finish.",US
6107,US,"Not surprisingly, this is similar to the Chards from this vineyard from Rob Talbott, which develop for a long time in the bottle. The wine is bone dry and very high in acidity, with a stony minerality to the peach and pineapple flavors. It's really too young now, but should begin to be ready by 2007.",US
6108,US,"Call it Chablis-like. This Chard is bone dry, crisp in citrusy acidity, and features stony, minerally flavors of Meyer lemons and limes. Try as a richer alternative to Pinot Grigio.",US
6109,US,"This makes you wonder why it took so long for California vintners to understand that Chard doesn't have to be drenched in oak to be succulent. The wine is crisp and dry in pineapple, pink grapefruit, green apple and cinnamon spice flavors. Great with shellfish and grilled chicken.",US
6110,US,"Another great RSR. A bit soft, but that's okay, as the pineapple custard, white peach and vanilla-oak flavors are perked up by bright citron and Meyer lemon. The finish is pure honey, rich and long and spicy. Such a complex wine.",US
6111,US,"Ed Sbragia loves new oak, and this one has 100% of it, which makes it toasty and woody. The underlying wine is dry and crisp, with peach, apple and pear flavors, but the oak is very heavy, leading to a crème brûlée finish without the sweetness.",US
6112,US,"A distinctive Chardonnay made in the Farrell style, which leans toward acidic and elegant. But this is not an austere wine, far from it. It has a rich minerality and flavors of lime and pineapple custard, and then an even richer crème brûlée finish. Delicious and complex.",US
6113,US,"Very oaky and very ripe, offering a flood of pineapple jam, pear, vanilla and toasty oak flavors. Crisp acidity provides needed balance and a clean, brisk mouthfeel.",US
6114,US,"Chards are tight, acidic and minerally in youth, showing a lees-infused structure but offering waves of complexity. With toasty oak, the base flavors are of nectarines, mangoes, peaches, zesty green apples and dustings of Asian spice.",US
6115,US,"Well oaked, with a toasty, vanilla-infused cream and caramel edge, this polished Chard has peach custard flavors dusted with cinnamon, nutmeg and candied ginger. It's delicious and complex. The word “rich” doesn't begin to do it justice.",US
6116,US,"Very rich, ripe and oaky, but something of a fruit-oak bomb. Blasts the palate with pineapple jam, toasty meringue, caramel and buttered toast aromas and flavors. Lacks subtlety.",US
6117,US,"It's a mystery how, in such a hot vintage, Talley produced this dry, minerally, almost austere Chardonnay. When everyone else was getting mangoes, this wine shows flint along with lime zest and kiwi. Yet the mark of Rincon Chard always has been a steely stoniness. The oak regime is big, but the wine handles it with aplomb. Best now through 2008.",US
6118,US,"The best Paraiso Chard I've ever had, this inaugural wine, a low-production block release, is tight and firm. Acidity, minerals and lees star. But there's also a tremendous core of ripe tropical fruits, roasted hazelnut, marzipan, coconut macaroon and all sorts of interesting things. Cellar it for a while, then drink from 2007–2010.",US
6119,US,"What a great job Tolosa has been doing with Chard, and it's all about that Edna Valley terroir. The fruit develops powerful kiwi and lime flavors, which are generously enriched with caramelly oak. Meanwhile, the climate preserves vital acidity. It's a perfect marriage.",US
6120,US,"This is one of those Chards that's more Burgundian than Californian. There's a rich earthiness followed by a minerally date nut, dried pineapple and spiced apple character. In the end, there's enough acidity to suggest mid-term aging.",US
6121,US,"Most of the grapes came from esteemed Dutton vineyards. The wine is enormously ripe. The juice was barrel fermented and aged sur lie. Creamy, packed with tropical fruit and smoky vanilla flavors, it's hedonistically delicious, but almost as sweet as a dessert wine.",US
6122,US,"It's tough to improve on Gordon Brothers' outstanding regular release of Chardonnay, a 90-point effort. All too often, the extra ripeness turns subtle nuances into thicker, less complex flavors. Barrel time adds butter and toast. So if you want a ripe, tropical, banana-and-peaches style of Chardonnay, with plenty of buttery oak, this will certainly do the trick. But somehow it seems less interesting than its cheaper sibling.",US
6123,US,"Deep gold and redolent of buttered nuts, this is made in the comfortable California style featuring barrel fermentation, full malolactic and extended oak aging on the lees. Results are predictably ripe and oaky, buttery and soft, with just a hint of baked apple acidity thanks to Washington-grown fruit.",US
6124,US,"A good Chardonnay, if a little unbalanced, showing some green, minty notes to the citrus and oak. Despite the rich creaminess, feels somewhat unripe. Drink now.",US
6125,US,"Very ripe and forward in pineapples and honey, with brisk acidity. Good and rich, but seems overwrought, lacking complexity and nuance, like a fruit juice drink.",US
6126,US,"The good news is the ripeness of this wine. It's also the bad news. It's so big in jammy peach, pear and tropical fruit flavors, and so oaky, that some degree of balance has been lost. Needs a little more restraint.",US
6127,US,"It's disturbing to taste a wine so dominated by sweet vanilla and toasty char, especially when the underlying wine is as good as this one seems to be. Buried under all that wood is a crisp, pineappley and minerally Chardonnay of considerable sophistication.",US
6128,US,"Made with full-throttle Burgundian techniques, with barrel fermentation in lots of new oak and sur lie aging applied to fat, juicy berries, to judge from their ripe, jammy fruitiness. Bursts with apricot, Meyer lemon, pineapple, guava, date, fig and smoky flavors. A bit over-wrought.",US
6129,US,"Lots of oak on this wine, which shows rich vanilla custard, buttered toast and caramel flavors. However, the underlying fruit isn't able to support it. There's some pineapple and nectarine, but the wine ultimately collapses under all the wood.",US
6130,US,"This is a clean, oaky and fairly simple Chardonnay. It satisfies the basic varietal requirements, with pineapple tart, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors. From Testarossa.",US
6131,US,"Many Napa Chards taste earthy, and so does this one. The earthiness is about green herbs, tobacco and soy-flavored tofu, but there's also plenty of pineapple fruit. On top of that, considerable new oak gives a blast of vanilla and spice. This interesting, complex Chard should challenge chefs to rise to the occasion.",US
6132,US,"An interesting wine that shows more complexity than you might think at this price. Blended with small amounts of other whites, it's dry and sleek, with citrus, peach, apricot and herbal-spice flavors that finish dry and crisp. Sur lie aging adds a yeasty touch.",US
6133,US,"X's basic Chard shows the bright acidity and minerality of Carneros, with ripe, savory peach jam, apple butter and tropical fruit flavors enriched with caramelly, smoky oak. It trades elegance for sheer power.",US
6134,US,"Simple and fruity, this is a pleasant, easy-drinking table wine. The Barrel Select designation does not mean oaky.",US
6135,US,"Shows the ripe pineapple fruit, acidity, minerality and above all sweet, smoky oak that mark a rich California Chardonnay. But there's something off. Hard to say exactly what, but it's in the taste. Like a smattering of mold or shriveled grapes that's off-putting.",US
6136,US,"Very clean and dry, high in citrusy acidity, and with a steely minerality. This streamlined Chard aims for structure, not opulence. The flavors are of white peaches and smoky oak. Defines the Farrell style of detailed elegance.",US
6137,US,"On opening, the oak on this Carneros Chard was overwhelming in smoke and char, giving the pear, Meyer lemon and kiwi flavors a woody undertow. As it breathes, it softens and unifies, but it's still a Hulk of a wine.",US
6138,US,"This is straightforward and crisp, showing apple and melon, a hint of baking spice and a tart, acidic finish.",US
6139,US,"Shows real Central Coast character in the zesty acidity that makes this Chard so bright. With jammy pineapple, Meyer lemon, kiwi and fig flavors, it also has forward oak influences. Lots going on in this fresh young wine.",US
6140,US,"Hogue's lowest-priced Chard is reliably clean fruit and appley, with firm acids and no frills. It does have some snap to the acids, a characteristic of Washington Chardonnay, and that sets it up for a food-friendly finish.",US
6141,US,"A pretty good, everyday Chardonnay that gives consumers the buttered toast and vanilla notes that come from oak, on top of a friendly, pineapple-flavored Chardonnay. A little one-dimensional, but will satisfy lots of wine drinkers.",US
6142,US,"A finish of sugary sweetness marks this Chard. It was grown in prime coastal regions, which accounts for the crisp acidity and long hangtime flavors of pineapples, green apples, Meyer lemons, kiwi fruit and spicy oak.",US
6143,US,"Desert Wind wines as a rule fall on the thin and watery side, but here the exceptional vintage has provided a welcome bit of concentration. Banana and tropical fruit are not especially rich but are reasonably persistent. Some time in new oak would have added depth to the finish, but then it wouldn't be bare naked.",US
6144,US,"A simple, everyday Chardonnay, with ripe pineapple, apricot and tropical fruit and caramelized oak flavors.",US
6145,US,"Adelsheim pioneered Dijon clone Chardonnay in Oregon, correctly guessing that the Burgundian grape would ripen better than the California (Wente) clones that were ubiquitous. CH is made with no oak, no malolactic fermentation, no residual sugar and no skin contact. In a way it's the anti-Chardonnay, but at the same time it is the purest style of Chardonnay. Bracing, fresh and zesty in the Euro mold, it's got flavors of melon, green apple and gooseberry.",US
6146,US,"On the soft side, but the limpid mouthfeel packs plenty of flavor, including well-ripened apple, peach, pear and pineapple.  Oak plays a dominant role, bringing vanilla, buttered toast and spice.",US
6147,US,"With crushed pineapple flavors enhanced with a bit of oak, this wine gets the tastebuds watering. It has fine balance, elegance and varietal character. The winemaker recommends poached salmon, which, with a sprig of dill and a squirt of lemon, seems perfect.",US
6148,US,"I like the oak on this wine, also the crispness, the tropical fruit flavors, but the creamy mouthfeel, and the way the fruit is yielding to a sweet nutty character. It's just beginning a slow down and should remain interesting through 2007.",US
6149,US,"The taste is dominated by sweet vanilla and caramelly oak. Buried under that are tropical fruit, pear and kiwi flavors. While the acidity is nice and crisp, the wine is too oaky.",US
6150,US,"Something went south on this wine. It has a stubbornly vegetal or moldy note throughout, to the detriment of the fruit, which seems to be rich, and the oak, which certainly is. Tasted in a flight of its price peers, it was a big last place.",US
6151,US,"This cool-climate wine needs a warm vintage to show its best, and it certainly got heat in 2004. The result is a big, opulent wine with masses of tropical fruit flavors slathered in spicy oak. Yet it retains crisp, citrusy acidity, and has an elegant streak of minerality.",US
6152,US,"Rich in peach, pear and tropical fruit, with an exotic toasted coconut cream pie taste that's simply delicious. Waves of rich, ripe, flamboyant flavor are what this Chard is all about.",US
6153,US,"Light and toasty, this is a melon and citrus combo, with yeasty bread dough flavors showing its youth.",US
6154,US,"A solid Chardonnay, although it finishes a bit sweet. Shows ripe flavors of pineapples, pears and oranges, with a flourish of smoky oak.",US
6155,US,"So fruity it's almost sweet. Made in the popular style, it's candied in vanilla, pineapple, buttered toast and caramel flavors.",US
6156,US,"Here's a high-acid, minerally Chard, that's clean in citrus zest, pink grapefruit and richer peach and pear flavors. With a touch of smoky oak, it's balanced elegance.",US
6157,US,"Too sweet, with jellied peach, pineapple and apricot flavors. Without the sugary taste this would be a really good Chard.",US
6158,US,"Generic Chardonnay, almost invisible, with some suggestions of soap and flowers and a bit of heat in the finish.",US
6159,US,"There's some bitterness along the edges of this wine; the tart, light fruit flavors are outlined in bitter phenolics that detract from the overall mouthfeel. Green apple and plenty of acid is the story here.",US
6160,US,"Tastes vegetal and tired. The wine is losing its pineapple and pear fruit, and there's not much to replace it except alcohol and oak.",US
6161,US,"A pleasant, nondescript wine. There's 10% Sauvignon Blanc in the blend, which gives it a little spicy lift, but the mainstay Chardonnay core seems generically lemony and falls away in the finish.",US
6162,US,"Here's a nice, fairly complex Chard that's ripe and toasty and full of peach, pear, green apple and cantaloupe flavors. Finishes dry and spicy-clean.",US
6163,US,"Way too sweet for balance, this wine has the benefit of crisp acidity, but the sugary raspberry jelly taste prevails.",France
6164,US,"No oak lets the basic wine show through, but the problem is that it's unbalanced. It's sugary sweet in peach and apricot flavors, with a harsh, burnt finish.",US
6165,US,"This bright gold Chardonnay is a bit heavy-handed. The oak really clobbers with lumbery, woody tannins. Somewhere in here there is pineapple and citrus fruit, but it gets buried.",US
6166,US,"Sharp, tart and thin, with biting green apple fruit flavors. From a high-acid year in Washington, this definitely shows it.",US
6167,US,"Ripe and oaky, with powerful tropical fruit, candied pear, peach, apricot jam and pineapple custard flavors. Nice acidity balances the earthiness and makes the finish clean and lively.",US
6168,US,"Against a background of dusty earth and herbs, there's bright peach, pear and pineapple flavors and a rich tangerine streak that meshes with the sweet new oak. It's all on the surface, but what a deliciously polished surface it is.",US
6169,US,"Shows brisk acidity for this warmish appellation, with upfront, pineapple custard, peach tart and apricot cobbler flavors wrapped in a honeyed mouthfeel. Just when you think it's a simple Chard, it reveals all kinds of layers.",US
6170,US,"Few wineries in California can craft a Chard as rich, balanced and ageworthy as this. In its youth this ‘05 is flashy in lemondrop, pear and spicy anise, with a honeyed finish and crisp acidity. It's quite addictively brilliant, a wine whose lush harmony mesmerizes the palate. But Hanzell Chards invariably age well, and this is a wine you can dependably put into your cellar for 5, 10, 15 years, even longer, as it continues to evolve and become more limpid and minerally.",US
6171,US,Tired and over the hill. It's an old Chardonnay losing its fruit and turning vegetal.,US
6172,US,"Immediately likeable for its direct, ripe flavors of candied peaches, kiwis, limes and pineapples. It has just the right acidity and a creamy texture.",US
6173,US,"There have been Estate Selection Chards from Cuvaison before, but never a block bottling. This wine fully merits its status and price. Tightly angular and acidic in youth, it's very minerally, with a gunmetal tang to the oak-infused Meyer lemon, green apple and green pear flavors. One of the rare California Chardonnays not ready on release, this Chablis-style wine will be best in mid-2008, and should develop for another few years.",US
6174,US,"What a roll Fess Parker Winery is on with their '08 Chardonnays. Not only great wine, but priced so well. This wine, sourced from Parker's U Block in this famous Santa Maria Valley vineyard, is as rich as any Chardonnay of the vintage—just massive in pineapple, pear and buttered toast flavors. Yet it's crisp and tart, clean and bracing in its minerality. Only 115 cases produced.",US
6175,US,"You want pure Monterey Chardonnay? Go here. It's all about peaches, apricots, pineapples, limes and kiwis, not to mention fresh crisp acidity. Where all that cream came from is a mystery, given that the wine is unoaked. Good wine, good price.",US
6176,US,"Here's one of those rare California Chards that needs time. The wine is tight, tough and minerally in its youth, with an austerity of flavors suggesting Meyer lemons, nectarines and flint. Bone dry and crisp, it should blossom between 2008 and 2015, with proper cellaring.",US
6177,US,"The very fine Allen Vineyard, on Westside Road in the tenderloin of the appellation, has produced a high-quality Chardonnay that is capable of some bottle aging. Dry and savory, it shows a strong mineral component to the pie filling limes, lemondrop, apple, fig and roasted hazelnut flavors. Should develop before fading, over the next 5 years.",US
6178,US,"A generous Chardonnay whose spicy taste leads to a crisp, dry finish. The wine is wonderfully ripe, showing pineapple, golden kiwi, Key lime pie and oaky vanilla flavors.",US
6179,US,"A small-production barrel selection from the estate vineyard, this fine wine is brilliantly rich and balanced, proving that Napa Valley can produce excellent Chardonnay. With pineapple, lemon, lime and buttered toast flavors, it's ultraclean in acidity and vibrant in minerals. While it's quite dry, it finishes with a rich flourish of honey.",US
6180,US,"Don't drink this beauty too cold with your lobster, crab or scallops. It has the weight of a noble wine, with minerality and creaminess giving shape and texture to the leesy, yeasty flavors of pineapples, Key lime pie and ripe pear purée. Aged in 40% new French oak, California Chardonnay hardly gets any better than this.",US
6181,US,"Here's a very dry, steely and streamlined Chardonnay. Brims with mineral-infused pineapple tart, buttered toast and honey flavors. Feels wonderfully elegant and balanced, and will pair beautifully with barbecued salmon. The vineyard is located on the so-called Santa Maria bench, one of the region's prime growing areas.",US
6182,US,"Good Chardonnay, rich and ripe and steely. That metallic thing shows up both in the crisp acidity and in the stony, pebbly tang that adds a piquant freshness to the pineapple, lime tart, tangerine and smoky custard-cream flavors.",US
6183,US,"Nice peach and apple pie flavors, along with fresher honeydew define this friendly, soft, somewhat earthy wine. A bit of lees and oak and complexity.",US
6184,US,"Clean, minerally and streamlined, with citrus zest, lees, oak flavors and a very dry finish. This will go well with shellfish. It's made in Mondavi's restrained, elegant style.",US
6185,US,"Rich in apricot, peach and pineapple flavors that finish a little sweet and oaky. This is the kind of inexpensive Chardonnay that California so effortlessly produces, all to the benefit of consumers.",US
6186,US,"Clean, dry and tart in acids, this is a minerally Chard with citrus and kiwi flavors. It has some oak that adds richness, but it's not really a rich wine. It's more of a streamlined, sleek sipper.",US
6187,US,"Nice and crisp in acidity, with ripe peach, apple and pineapple flavors. There's a bite of green sharpness on the finish, but it's still a good Chard.",US
6188,US,"Another unoaked Chard hits the market, and with good results at a good price. Nothing but juicy peach, pear and pineapple flavors and crisp acidity. Oak probably would have brought it down.",US
6189,US,"Grown in the warmest part of the appellation, this Chard is soft and without the acidity you find closer to the ocean. But it's a very tasty wine brimming with tropical fruit, honeysuckle, buttered toast and vanilla flavors.",US
6190,US,"Here's a nice everyday sort of Chard, forward in bright lime, kiwi and nectarine flavors. Tastes like it comes from a far cooler climate than Paso Robles. A bit more concentration would send the score through the roof.",US
6191,US,"Those familiar with Morgan's more expensive Chardonnays, such as the Double L (which comprises 55% of this blend) will find true value in this regional wine. It shows similar power and authority in a showy, Chablis-style wine whose acidic, minerally structure frames intense citrus and oak flavors.",US
6192,US,"Shows richness in the ripe peach, pear and apple flavors, although the wine, from Yountville and Oak Knoll, is a little soft and earthy compared to cool-climate Chards. Dry and clean.",US
6193,US,"Dry, bright in acids, and fruity, with kiwi and lime flavors that finish with a spicy flourish. This is a nicely elegant Chard that won't break the bank.",US
6194,US,"As tart in acids and zingy as cool-climate Chard comes, with bright, mouth-stimulating lime and kiwi flavors that finish dry and clean. There's a tiny bit of oak, but the fruit really stars in this tasty, affordable wine.",US
6195,US,"There's something Chablisian about this Chardonnay. It's partly the acidity, which is high, and partly the gunmetal minerality, courtesy of another cool vintage in the southern Napa/Carneros region where the grapes were grown. Add in oak-infused pineapples, peaches and pears, and you have a fairly significant wine that could even benefit from some years in the cellar.",US
6196,US,"Dry and fashionable, this has a dusty, minerally character and high acidity that's reminiscent of a good Chablis. The cool, long vintage resulted in subtle peach, pear, pineapple and spice flavors.",US
6197,US,"Ripeness was not a problem with this wine, which is fat and unctuous. It shows complex apricot, mineral, pear, green apple and lees flavors that finish with a glyceriney taste of honey. Should develop for a few years in the bottle.",US
6198,US,"INOX—from the French inoxidable—is Chehalem's stainless steel fermented and aged take on Chardonnay. It is consistently their best effort, with bright, acid-driven fruit that is a complex blend of pineapple, green apple, golden apple and Asian pear. It doesn't try to be more than it is, and it has a wonderfully persistent finish.",US
6199,US,"Smooth, crisply acidic and bone dry, this Chard shows an austere minerality and streamlined texture that makes it very food-friendly. It's packed with Meyer lemon, yellow apricot and fig flavors that finish long and spicy. Really nice, and shows the promise of Lake County for Chardonnay.",US
6200,US,"Missing the lushness of the Goodchild Chard, but still a clean, tasty wine showing pineapple and toasty oak flavors. Easy to savor with its zesty acidity.",US
6201,US,"Okay everyday Chard, with toned-down peach, pear and oak flavors and a creaminess to the texture. Finishes dry, crisp and short.",US
6202,US,"Clean and tasty, this crisp, dry Chard has modest peach, apple and tropical fruit flavors. It's a nice country wine at a fair price.",US
6203,US,"The vineyard is in inland Hopland, and the wine has that warm-climate fruitiness. It shows tremendous peach, apricot, pineapple and pear flavors, with a slightly rustic, sweet finish.",US
6204,US,"This hugely ripe Chardonnay is just a little too big for absolute balance. Any more powerful, and it would be over the line. As it is, it flirts with it, with gobs of jammy apricots, yellow pears, citrine and Meyer lemondrop, as well as barrel influences ranging from creamy lees to buttered toast, roasted hazelnuts and smoky honey. The alcohol is over 15%.",US
6205,US,"Nice price, clean wine, and probably unoaked. However, the fruit is kind of thin and watery.",US
6206,US,"Soft and simple, with candied peach and pear flavors and some oaky, leesy influence that makes it a little fancier.",US
6207,US,"This is a high acid style of Chardonnay, reflective of a vintage that was one of the coolest in a decade or more. Crisp and detailed, this offers a classy mix of citrus and apple, wet stone and light baking spices. Hints of nutmeg and cinnamon adorn the fruit, which lingers gently through a citrusy finish.",US
6208,US,"This is quite a hefty young Chard. It takes the basic elements of ripe, potent fruit, oak, and Burgundian-inspired technique and elevates it all, a Chard on steroids. The peach, tropical fruit, pear, candied ginger and charry oak flavors have an acidic scour. Drink now and for the next 5 years.",US
6209,US,"With no oak, the pure, brilliantly ripe Chardonnay fruit shines through in this rewarding wine. It's so rich in tropical fruit, peach, pear and citrus flavors, you won't even miss the barrel influence. Best of all is the cool-climate crispness that makes the finish so clean and vibrant.",US
6210,US,"Simple, with earthy flavors and thinned-down peaches and apples. There's a little oak. Finishes dry and crisp.",US
6211,US,"Simple, with canned peach and apricot flavors and a slightly sweet finish.",France
6212,US,"Kind of soft and thin, but there's a nice, dry Chardonnay character and enough peaches and cream flavors smoky oak and creamy texture to satisfy.",US
6213,US,"Rough and ready, this is a dry, crisply tart wine with thinned-down citrusy flavors that will do in a pinch.",France
6214,US,"For such a large production Chard, this one gives a lot of concentrated varietal purity. It's dry and crisp, brimming with ripe pineapple, green apple, Key lime pie, pear, date and smoky vanilla flavors that finish with real sophistication and class.",US
6215,US,"This lovely wine is light but tempting, with sweet herb, yellow apple and pale peach fruit flavors. The wine is not pushed past the limits of the fruit, but all the flavor and focus possible have been extracted from these grapes. Beautifully balanced and perfect for a mix of light seafood or cheese.",US
6216,US,"Can't recommend this wine because it's just too thin. It's pretty much watery alcohol, with a few drops of Chard essence.",US
6217,US,"Here's a bright, exotically fruity Chard that satisfies all around for its lime, kiwi, butterscotch, fig, honey and toast flavors and brisk, cleansing acidity. Drink this yummy wine now.",US
6218,US,"“Nu” seems to be Kunde's way of letting us know that this is an unoaked Chardonnay. It shows pure, untrammelled Chard flavors of green apples, peaches, pears, kiwis and limes. It's also a very crisp wine, as it did not undergo the malolactic fermentation.",US
6219,US,"Here's a steely, minerally, sleek Chardonnay. Call it Cali-Chablis, if you will. That doesn't mean it's lean. Quite the opposite, it's an enormously complicated wine, with oak, lees and underlying peach custard and spicy mango cream flavors that finish long and dry. And what great acidity. Makes your mouth water. Chalk Hill is simply doing an amazing job lately, especially with Chardonnay.",US
6220,US,"Don't look for fat, buttery stuff here. This wine is as streamlined as a steel girder. With high acidity and a firm minerality, it hits the palate clean and spicy. But once it warms up, wham! Exotic kiwis, limes and mangoes take over as well as the buttercream effects of barrel fermentation. Fantastic concentration, and probably good for a decade.",US
6221,US,"Represents a very nice value in a refreshing, balanced Chardonnay. The wine, which was aged in lots of new American oak and stirred on the lees, is rich and creamy, with citrus, mineral and yeasty flavors that are brightened by crisp acidity.",US
6222,US,"Shows the crisp acidity that usually marks Carneros Chards, and also an earthy, freshly picked herb quality to the jammy peach, pineapple and green apple flavors. Consider it a food-worthy Chardonnay. Drink now.",US
6223,US,"For decades Hanzell has been making one of California's most (and only) ageworthy Chards. The '03 is one for the cellar, but it comes at the price of being hard in youth. Starts out flinty and tannic, although as it airs, new oak and pineapple emerge. This seems like a very good Hanzell. Best 2009–2015.",US
6224,US,"This Chard is straightforward and tasty, showing the bright acidity and laser-pure fruit that Edna Valley is known for. The Meyer lemon, lime and kiwi flavors are firmed up with brilliant acidity leading to an impressively long, spicy finish.",US
6225,US,"Lots to like in this dry, fruity Chardonnay. It has flavors of tropical fruits, buttered toast and caramel, wrapped into a rich, creamy mouthfeel. But it's pretty acidic, if you're sensitive to prickliness in your wines.",US
6226,US,"This is a lovely Chardonnay, delicately structured, elegantly silky, crisp and authoritative. It doesn't whack you with fruit, but presents subtle peach custard, buttercream and citrus flavors girded with a hard minerality. Quite a bit of new oak adds complexity. This is a good Chard for foodies who shy away from the fruit bombs.",US
6227,US,"Super-ripe in tropical papaya, pineapple and white peach flavors, with a charry, caramel sweetness that seems to come from oak. Sweet clove and anise on the finish.",US
6228,US,"Polished and fruity, with ripe peach custard, nectarine, pear and spicy green apple flavors enriched with the vanilla and buttered toast of oak barrels. Crisp acidity makes the wine racy.",US
6229,US,"Much like the winery's pleasing Pinot Gris, this Dijon clone Chard is made in a clean, lightly herbal style. Roughly half was barrel fermented and half in stainless, all resting sur lie for twelve months. Along with the crisp apple flavors and sweet grass are hints of wet stone and a gentle impression of bourbon barrel.",US
6230,US,"Morgan has hit its stride with this unoaked Chardonnay. Nothing comes between the intense citrus, pineapple, white peach, apple and spice flavors and your palate. Cleansing acidity boosts it all and makes the wine star-bright. Morgan leads the pack of California unoaked Chards.",US
6231,US,"Very crisp in zesty acidity, bone dry, and with exotic flavors. This stony, minerally Chardonnay impresses for its firm structure. Flavorwise, it's explosive in lemons, limes, crunchy pears, Asian spices and buttery vanilla, even though it's unoaked. Showcases its terroir in a fine way.",US
6232,US,"What a nice wine for this price. It's so dry and crisp and minerally and easy to drink, with enough sophistication to satisfy even fussy wine snobs. The subtle flavors include lemons, limes and smoky oak.",US
6233,US,"Pavilion has a perfect record with Chardonnay, four vintages in a row with a consistent score. The ‘06 like its predecessors is ripe and satisfying, with good varietal character. The peach and pineapple flavors have creamy, smoky nuances.",US
6234,US,"Although it has spent quite a bit of time in bottle, this wine still seems overweighted to its oak – the barrel flavors, woody and slightly bitter, overwhelm the golden apple fruit. It seems to be fading already, a bit past its peak.",US
6235,US,"Pretty nice for a Chard of this everyday price. Made by 7-Eleven for sale in their stores, it's dry and creamy, with good varietal flavors of peaches, pears and apple butter, and is a good value.",US
6236,US,"Complex, with tiers of tropical fruit, mineral, and oak flavors that unfold in waves. The wine is dry and opulent in spiced papayas and macaroons, leading to a caramel-like finish.",US
6237,US,"With jammy peach, apricot, pear and pineapple fruit flavors, this is a pretty nice everyday Chard, at a fair price. It has a creamy texture and a spicy aftertaste.",US
6238,US,"Bone dry, acidic and minerally, this isn't very Chard-like in terms of richness of fruit. But it's clean and pleasantly sippable, with modest apple and lime flavors.",US
6239,US,"Here's a basic, Santa Barbara Chardonnay that shows off the region's cool-climate friendliness to the variety. It's dry and crisp and creamy, with pineapple, lime and oak flavors.",US
6240,US,"Solidly in the winery's house style, this is a clean, varietally true Chard, dry and balanced. It shows citrus, green apple and mineral flavors, while partial barrel fermentation adds elements of smoky cream and buttered toast.",US
6241,US,"The structure on this wine is just fine, with crisp, coastal acidity and low alcohol making for a clean, well-balanced Chard. Its weakness is in the thinness of flavor. The wine is watery, with mere traces of citrus fruits and peaches.",France
6242,US,"This soft, simple wine tastes more like Gewürztraminer than Chardonnay, with spice and wildflower notes to the apricots.",US
6243,US,"This is a hard and steely, with a sour lemon center and a vitamin finish. Perhaps with a great deal of airing it would fill in a bit, but there's not much going on.",US
6244,US,"Sharp and green, with a minty, chlorophyll taste. High acidity makes the finish searing.",US
6245,US,"Vegetal and watery, a very dry wine that offers little in the way of fruit. Tastes like alcohol with a drop or two of grapefruit juice.",US
6246,US,"Great Chardonnay, exotically rich and complex. With the crisp, zesty acidity of Russian River in a cool vintage, the wine is impressively balanced despite its powerhouse flavors. Pineapples, mangoes, papayas, new oak, minerals and Asian spices mingle together, leading to a long finish.",US
6247,US,"Los Alamos is a Santa Barbara region that should have its own appellation, to judge by this and many other wines grown there. A cool place, it has given this Chardonnay brilliantly crisp acidity, while ripening the fruit to perfection. Apricots, peaches, pears and mangoes are the primary flavors, enhanced with rich, toasty oak.",US
6248,US,"This wine starts out so acidic, it's almost sour. Then the intense lemondrop flavors kick in, followed by the lush vanilla-accented smoky new oak, and the chalky minerals on the finish, and suddenly, the acidity makes sense. It's Chablisian, built for the cellar. By sometime in 2008, everything should start to meld together, and this block selection could do amazing things over the next four to six years.",US
6249,US,"This is a distinctive Chardonnay, with pea vine and peach, anise and apple mixing it up. It has a lovely, lifted elegance that keeps the flavors intertwined but allows you to experience them separately as well, and it carves a flavor trail through the finish that lingers sensuously. Could be the best CV Chardonnay ever from L'Ecole.",US
6250,US,"This is one of the biggest, richest Chardonnays that Rodney Strong has ever produced, and no wonder, as longtime winemaker Rick Sayre was assisted by David Ramey as a consultant. The wine has Ramey-esque proportions, gigantic in fleshy tropical fruit, caramel, vanilla cream, butterscotch and meringue flavors. It's so softly decadent, it's almost better as a cocktail wine than with food.",US
6251,US,"Concentrated, beautifully defined flavors of pear, apple and ripe pineapple drive a stake through the heart of this wine, blazing a trail across the palate with tongue-thrashing acids and bracing minerality. As it slowly unwinds it reveals a finish of banana caramel tart, luscious and long.",US
6252,US,"Shows the softness of Alexander Valley Chardonnay, and the delicious complexity that these wines can attain. Apricots, pineapples, peaches and Meyer lemons are the fruits, framed by vanilla and smoke from new oak, and finishing with a minerality that must come from the earth.",US
6253,US,"This is a bold, oaky Chardonnay. Toasty roasted-nut aromas lead the charge, followed by hints of peach and melon, while a strong vanilla component comes forward on the palate. Finishes warm, with prominent oak spice.",US
6254,US,"This is the oldest of the Milbrandt vineyards, planted in 1997. Though a bit riper than the Evergreen vineyard bottling, this Chardonnay feels lighter, with less density. It's balanced and complete, and the flavors of green apple and Asian pear offer a fine rendition of well-ripened Washington fruit.",US
6255,US,"This is a blend of several vineyards, instead of the winery's usual single-vineyard Chards. It's been tastefully assembled, and displays good Central Coast acidity framing tropical fruit and oak flavors with a stony, minerally edge.",US
6256,US,"A sweet, simple Chardonnay, tasting like the juice from canned peaches, pears and pineapples, slightly sweetened, with touches of smoky oak. Satisfies your basic Chardonnay sweet tooth.",US
6257,US,"A bit obvious in ripe fruit and oak, with easy flavors of pineapples, apricots, vanilla cream and smoky caramel. But the price is right, and this wine, whose production was 20,000 cases, will please lots of people.",US
6258,US,"Simple, soft and sweet, with buttered popcorn, buttered toast and sugared pineapple jam flavors. Nice acidity, though, and a nice creamy texture.",US
6259,US,"A very nice Chardonnay at a friendly price. It shows familiar peaches-and-cream and buttered toast flavors, with a dry, clean finish. Easy to find, with 3,500 cases produced.",US
6260,US,"Unique and distinctive, this unusual effort mixes ripe, lightly peachy fruit with aggressively smoky barrel notes. It's a difficult wine to score ; although this is not a technically perfect bottle, it delivers a lot of flavor—if you really like smoke.",US
6261,US,"Light, tart, slightly green fruit flavors don't add up to much. There is an undertone of old barrel or something not quite fresh. Simple and plain.",US
6262,US,"New smoky oak dominates this Chardonnay. Under all that vanilla, buttered toast and caramel, you'll find pineapple and tangerine jam flavors, wrapped into a creamy texture.",US
6263,US,"A bit thin and earthy, but dry, with modest, everyday flavors of peaches and pears.",US
6264,US,"Lots of oak on this wine, which shows rich vanilla custard, buttered toast and caramel flavors. However, the underlying fruit isn't able to support it. There's some pineapple and nectarine, but the wine ultimately collapses under all the wood.",US
6265,US,"This is a clean, oaky and fairly simple Chardonnay. It satisfies the basic varietal requirements, with pineapple tart, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors. From Testarossa.",US
6266,US,"Soft and sweet in vanilla, buttered toast and honey flavors, this Chard also features plenty of pineapple and pear jam richness. Good price for the opulence.",US
6267,US,"The blend includes 5% Viognier, a nice touch from winemaker Joy Anderson, as it adds both spice and lift to the Chardonnay. Lime butter and caramel run through the veins of this supremely smooth and soft offering.",US
6268,US,"Truly done in a Burgundian style, with bracing minerality and sweet, liquorous oak and apple cider flavors. The tangy fruit mixes fresh lemon and orange juice, pineapple and candied rind.",US
6269,US,"Too acidic, almost sour, and pretty sweet, with pineapple and orange flavors. Gets the Chardonnay job done, but seems pricey for what you get.",US
6270,US,"Nicely dry, tart in acidity and clean, but flavor-wise, there's not much going on. The tastes are of minerals and alcohol, with a squirt of citrus juice.",US
6271,US,"A tartly acidic, slightly green wine, with mineral, peach, green grape and pineapple flavors. Turns sweet-and-sour on the finish.",US
6272,US,"Shows sweet-and-sour pineapple and orange fruit flavors, like a Chinese restaurant duck sauce. Lacks balance and sophistication, but will please fans of the style.",US
6273,US,"Too sweet and oaky, with sugary lemondrop candy, Lifesaver pineapple and vanilla extract flavors. Malolactic fermentation adds even sweeter tastes of buttered popcorn. Praiseworthy for its acidic freshness, but rather heavy-handed.",US
6274,US,"Chardonnay fans will like the pineapple and pear flavors, with their creamy, spicy edge of vanilla and pepper spice. It's a direct, dry wine at a pretty good price.",US
6275,US,"Made in an off-dry style, this Chardonnay shows sugary flavors of pineapples, peaches, pears and vanilla extract. It's a simple wine with clean acidity.",US
6276,US,"Tastes like a fruit juice blend of oranges, peaches and apricots, with a kiss of oak flavor. Standard fare, this boxed wine is the equivalent of four regular bottles.",US
6277,US,"A decent, everyday Chardonnay. Tastes dryish, with pineapple and caramel flavors.",US
6278,US,"A pretty good Chardonnay, especially at this price. Delivers lots of bang for the buck, with ripe, honeyed flavors of pineapples, pears and buttered toast.",US
6279,US,"Pretty simple, but the price is right for an everyday, clean Chardonnay. Shows modest, fruit juice flavors of pineapples and oranges, with a hint of butter and cream.",US
6280,US,"This Chardonnay balances fresh and lush flavors, offering a toasty spice and apple nose and flavors of creamy vanilla toast and apple, peach and warming spice. Approachable but displaying some complexity. A friendly everyday white.",US
6281,US,"High in acidity, with the tang and taste of a kefir lime, this barrel-aged Chardonnay has richer notes of vanilla, buttered toast and cream. Good price for a food-friendly wine.",US
6282,US,"Simple and fruity, this is a pleasant, easy-drinking table wine. The Barrel Select designation does not mean oaky.",US
6283,US,"Shows the ripe pineapple fruit, acidity, minerality and above all sweet, smoky oak that mark a rich California Chardonnay. But there's something off. Hard to say exactly what, but it's in the taste. Like a smattering of mold or shriveled grapes that's off-putting.",US
6284,US,"Sweet and oaky, with butterscotch, vanilla cream, pineapple crème brûlée and cinnamon spice flavors.",US
6285,US,"Made in the modern style, this Chardonnay is very ripe and rich in jammy pineapples, green apples and limes, enhanced with smoky, caramelized oak and a creamy, slightly sour note of lees. It's fortunately balanced with crisp acidity. Best now and through 2012 before the fruit goes south.",US
6286,US,"Whether it's the vintage, or simply the evolution of winemaking at this new winery, this reserve Chardonnay is more restrained and structured than past efforts. Still young and compact, it shows succulent green apple and white peach flavors along with toast and butterscotch.",US
6287,US,"Sugary sweet and flabby, with the flavors of little dessert pastries of pineapple jam, vanilla and baked pie crust.",US
6288,US,"Simple, oaky and fruity, with pineapple jam, buttered toast and vanilla flavors. Made in a direct, consumer-appealing style.",US
6289,US,"Seems like a throwaway from this winery that's more properly focused on Paso Robles. Sweet and oaky and simple, with flavors of pineapple jam and buttered popcorn.",US
6290,US,"An oaky style of Chardonnay, to be sure, but so deliciously fruity that the toasty barrel flavors seem to blend seamlessly into a thick pool of juicy citrus and stone fruits. Lively, spicy, and detailed with cinnamon and white pepper, this irresistible flavor bomb of a Chardonnay demands that you immediately refill your glass.",US
6291,US,"This is an oaky, leesy Chardonnay, and quite a good one. Although it's super rich in fruit, it shows a crisply acidic minerality that grounds it and makes it serious. That fruit is wildly forward in pineapple tart, pear butter, Key lime pie and golden apricot.",US
6292,US,"A beautiful young Chardonnay, brisk in acidity, and ultra-clean despite the richness. Shows exotic tropical fruit, white peach and sweet vanilla flavors, with a fine minerality that grounds and complexes the fruit. Really easy for everybody to like, although connoisseurs will find all kinds of nuances.",US
6293,US,"One of the better Napa Valley Chardonnays out there. The fruit was sourced from various parts of the valley. Fruity richness is balanced with clean, zesty acidity, and the overlay of 50% new oak is just fine. Shows vanilla cream, pineapple, mango and lime flavors, with a pretty minerality.",US
6294,US,"Fruit-juice sweet, like a pineapple, orange and peach drink, with high, almost sour acidity. Gets the Chardonnay job done.",US
6295,US,"This simple Chardonnay is soft and sweet, with some vanilla oaky notes. It's made in the popular style.",US
6296,US,"Sweet and simple in apricot and pineapple flavors, with a heavy coating of caramelized oak. Drinkable, but disagreeably fruit-juicy.",US
6297,US,"This Chardonnay in a box is the equivalent of four regular bottles, but it's not a very good wine. It's ultradry and acidic, with unripe, vegetal flavors that just approach citrus fruits.",France
6298,US,"There's an unripe, vegetal taste that detracts from the wine's otherwise fine qualities. It's dry and crisp and minerally, with pineapple fruit. But that asparagus edge is annoying.",US
6299,US,"Fruity sweet and cloying, with the flavor of pineapple jam and buttered popcorn and a sprinkle of white sugar for good measure.",US
6300,US,"Feels soft and cloyingly sweet in pineapple jam and buttered popcorn flavors, and is beginning to be tired and old. Drink up.",US
6301,US,"Sweet and oaky, in the modern style, with oodles of buttered toast, caramel corn, vanilla cream and pineapple jam flavors.",US
6302,US,"Not much going on with this dry, crisp Chardonnay. It has watery flavors of citrus fruits and apricots, with a hint of oak.",US
6303,US,"This full-bodied Chardonnay begins with aromas of vanilla toast, herbs and cream, followed by toasty spice and fruit flavors. The finish is lingering and curvy. Not terribly complex, but a good cohort to lobster, crab and creamy pasta dishes.",US
6304,US,"Made in a ripe, oaky style, this Chardonay has soft, luscious flavors of pineapple jam, pears, vanilla cream and buttered toast.",US
6305,US,"A pretty good, everyday Chardonnay that gives consumers the buttered toast and vanilla notes that come from oak, on top of a friendly, pineapple-flavored Chardonnay. A little one-dimensional, but will satisfy lots of wine drinkers.",US
6306,US,"Tart in Meyer lemon and lime flavors, with a touch of vanilla cream, this Chardonnay is pleasant and direct. It's a nice everyday sipper.",US
6307,US,"Brisk and refreshing in the mouth, with stimulating acidity. But it's a little too sweet in the combination of jammy citrus fruit and smoky oak.",US
6308,US,"Very dry and somewhat lean, with citrus, mineral and peach flavors. Oak adds a rich coating of buttered toast and smoky caramel. An elegant wine that's at its best now.",US
6309,US,"With pineapple crème brûlée, Key lime pie and kiwi flavors that are accented with sweet, smoky oak, this Chardonnay offers an uptown sip compromised only by a certain herbaceousness. Drink now.",US
6310,US,"Ripe and soft, a creamy Chard with flavors of buttered popcorn, pineapple jam and vanilla. Finishes almost as sweet as a Starbucks drink.",US
6311,US,"Too strong in oak, with vanilla, buttered popcorn and smoky meringue flavors overwhelming the underling tropical fruit. Tastes awkward and unbalanced.",US
6312,US,"Sweet and simple, with flavors of canned peaches and apricots, and a squirt of vanilla.",US

6318,US,"Vegetal, and the richer pineapple and vanilla cream flavors do nothing to make it go away. Through the dry, acidic mouthfeel, that taste of asparagus comes through.",US

6334,US,"Ultra-rich and decadent, Morgan's 08 Double L shows its signature tropical fruit, apricot and mineral flavors, accented with the smoky vanilla, buttered toast and caramel from toasted oak, and brightened with acidity.

6342,US,"Disjointed from the start, this wine never pulls itself together. Cracker, oily fruit, overripe apples, and some burn in the finish.",US

6344,US,"You can find almost anything you want in this intricate wine, it's that complex. Shows brilliant lucidity and a simple purity, like a Japanese garden. The mineral, wet stone, Asian pear, honey tangerine and lime flavors are so unctuous, it's hard to believe the wine saw no oak.",US
6345,US,"This is the richest of Diatom's 2009 unoaked Chards. It's wildly expressive in tangerines, white truffles and honey, braced with a pleasing minerality. The alcohol is quite high, but an integral part of the wine's oily, glyceriney mouthfeel.",France

6347,US,"It's easy to get ripe fruit in California and then plaster it in oak, but what's so difficult to achieve is the crisp, minerally structure this wine displays.

Only 349 cases produced.",US
6348,US,"An awesome Chardonnay that gives everything you want in richness, yet frames it in a structural integrity rare in California.

6353,US,"This is the most citrusy of Testarossa's '07 Chards, brimming with Meyer lemon, lime and pineapple flavors. Smooth, smoky oak and lees add complex layers of butter, cream and tart yeastiness. Brilliant but immature, the wine should come into its own after 2009.",US
6354,US,"Native yeast, weekly batinage (lees stirring) in 50% new barrels, and, most importantly, a superb vineyard—Stillwater Creek—make for the best Chardonnay yet from Sparkman.

6357,US,"Amazingly rich and ripe, defining the Bien Nacido cool-climate style. The grapes hung for a long time in this excellent vintage, getting ripe and balanced, and the wine offers dazzling opulence, while preserving vital acidity.

6360,US,"A beautiful Chardonnay for drinking now. It's dry and crisp, with pineapple, peach and pear flavors accented with vanilla oak and creaminess from lees aging.

The vineyard is in the cool Green Valley.",US
6362,US,"Extremely rich and ripe, with tremendous pineapple, pear, mango and white flower flavors that have been liberally oaked.

It's a racehorse, beautifully proportioned, and built for both near term and long term enjoyment.",US

6367,US,"Something went south on this wine. It has a stubbornly vegetal or moldy note throughout, to the detriment of the fruit, which seems to be rich, and the oak, which certainly is. Tasted in a flight of its price peers, it was a big last place.",US
6368,US,"Made with organically grown grapes, this tawny-colored Chardonnay is ready to go. It shows well-evolved flavors of ripe apple and pear, with a cidery finish. Despite the Columbia Valley labeling, it is from Horse Heaven Hills.",US

6370,US,"Sweet and simple, like a blend of pineapple juice, pear juice and lemonade. But the wine is clean and crisp.",US

6378,US,"A little heavy and syrupy, but for twelve bucks, you get a creamy wine with pineapple jam and vanilla flavors.",US
6379,US,"A near replica of the wonderful 2007, and an equally powerful value. Enormously rich and attractive in pineapple cream, golden mango, lemon chiffon pie, buttered toast and dusty spice flavors; crisp Central Coast acidity makes it alive and vibrant. Only 400 cases produced, but worth the search.",US
6380,US,"Awesomely rich, showing fine acidity and a stony minerality that ground and anchor it, but really notable for the explosive tropical fruit, apricot, pear and buttery oak flavors that are so opulent. The wine went through a complete malolactic fermentation.",US
6381,US,"Very ripe, rich and new-oaky, with dazzling flavors of ripe pineapples, pears, limes, caramel and buttered toast, drizzled with vanilla honey. A crowd-pleasing Chardonnay of enormous power and concentration. Could use a touch more nuance and complexity, but a tremendous wine at a good price for the quality.",US
6382,US,"Not for fans of rich Chardonnays, this is a very dry, acidic bottling. It's more about clean mouthfeel and scour than hedonism. What fruit there is suggests limes, pears and brisk minerals, while smoky oak and lees contribute toasty, buttery, creamy notes. A distinguished and elegant wine that defines cool-climate coastal conditions. Grows more complex and interesting as it warms in the glass.",US
6383,US,"A very rich Chardonnay, notable for its complex flavors of pineapples, sweet Meyer lemons, Key lime pie, buttered toast and smoky caramelized oak. Acidity is quite high, and plays a role in the way it tingles and cleanses the mouth. There's a fresh, jammy quality that makes the wine taste younger than its almost three years. Should develop in the bottle through 2013.",US
6384,US,"The oak sticks out with vanilla custard, brown sugar and buttered toast notes that currently dominate the underlying pineapple, white peach and green apple fruit flavors. Acidity is crisp and fine. This Chardonnay could benefit from a few years in the cellar.",US
6385,US,"A very fine Chardonnay, not just because it's so ripe and fruity, but more importantly because the underlying structure is so fine. Crisp acidity and some dusty tannins frame pineapple tart and zesty green apple flavors, enriched with winemaker interventions of sweet oak and creamy lees. Classy and delicious.",US
6386,US,"Combines rich, vibrant acidity with fruity intensity in a very clean, opulent wine. Offers waves of tropical fruits, honeysuckle, buttered toast and minerals, with a long, spicy finish. The extensive new oak is perfectly in keeping with the size of this crowd-pleaser. Now–2014.",US

6393,US,"The vineyard is in the interior part of the appellation, toward Carneros, and the wine displays the firm, acidic minerality of that cool, foggy region. It has fantastic limpidity. The oak is remarkable for the purity of vanilla and smoky honey, while the underlying flavors of Meyer lemons, pineapples, nectarines and kumquats are decadently good. A masterpiece of Chardonnay.",US
6394,US,"Really delicious, a rich, opulent wine that beguiles from first sip to last. It's sweetly caramelized and vanilla-oaky, with crisp acidity brightening ultraripe flavors of pineapples, golden mangoes and buttered toast.",US
6395,US,"Made in a leaner, acidic, minerally style, this bone-dry wine feels ultra-clean and distinguished in the mouth. It's austere, but you'll find a core of pineapples, apples and limes. Great with a shellfish-inspired risotto. Elegant and food-friendly, it should develop over the next 4–5 years.",US
6396,US,"A new price point tier for K-J, in between Grand Reserve and Highlands Estates. Bright and racy in cool-climate acidity, with layered flavors of lemondrop candy, lemon chiffon pie and buttered toast. Delicious and savory. The grapes are from the Santa Maria Valley and the Los Alamos region.",US
6397,US,"Good price, but a little too soft and sweet for a dry table wine. Shows sugary, pie-filling flavors of pineapples, with lots of vanilla-oak influence.",US
6398,US,"This is a solid, everyday Chard. It's very dry and crisp, with earthy, fruity citrus flavors. The acidity may be a little too high for some people.",US
6399,US,"Too oaky, with vanilla cream and sweet butterscotch flavors dominating the underlying pineapples, apples and limes.",US
6400,US,"Unbalanced and thin, with green aromas and flavors of pyrazines just barely breaking into lemons and limes. Drily acidic, too.",US
6401,US,"Tastes vegetal and tired. The wine is losing its pineapple and pear fruit, and there's not much to replace it except alcohol and oak.",US
6402,US,"A pleasant, nondescript wine. There's 10% Sauvignon Blanc in the blend, which gives it a little spicy lift, but the mainstay Chardonnay core seems generically lemony and falls away in the finish.",US
6403,US,"A nice Chardonnay whose rich, sweet smoky oak is pronounced, but doesn't dominate, as it does on their reserve Proximus bottling. Shows a nice minerally and slight herbal taste to the pineapples, apples and peaches.",US
6404,US,"This crisp and stylish Chardonnay could serve as a poster child for Washington, with its emphasis on the fruit, not the barrel, and modest ripeness that accents green apple and gooseberry flavors, with a little brioche in the finish. Scented with apple blossoms and lemon oil, this style brings out the intensity of the fruit, and enhances the capacity of the wine to cleanse your palate, leaving you refreshed and ready for food.",US
6405,US,"This is a typical Sonoma Coast Chard in the bright acidity that firms up the ripe, long hangtime flavors. Pineapples, pears, peaches, nectarines and subtle papaya notes are joined with buttercream and cinnamon spices. Drink now.",US

6407,US,"High acidity marks this vibrant wine, which is from one of Kendall-Jackson's coolest coastal vineyards.

Feels racy and nervy all through, in a delicious way.",US
6408,US,"Here's a big, sumptuous, fat, oily Chardonnay, massive in tropical fruits, spices, minerals and smoky buttered toast. The creamy texture makes it feel especially rich. Aged in 57% new oak, it's truly a decadent—but balanced—Chardonnay.",US
6409,US,"Awesomely rich, with massive tropical fruit, pear, vanilla cream and buttered toast flavors, finished with cinnamon spice. Acidity is high and crisp, and a bright scour of minerals brings balance. Made in the modern style, this is a Chardonnay to drink with lobster and scallops.",US

6411,US,"Made of equal parts ultraripe pineapple and exotic lime fruit, coupled with sweet, smoky crème brûlée and buttered toast from oak and lees stirring, this is a super-rich Chardonnay. Don't drink it too cold; it matures and knits together as it breathes in the glass.",US
6412,US,"Opulent and captivating, this Chard captures the rich, bells and whistles style of California, while maintaining a sense of style and elegance. Coastal acidity provides a bracing structure for the ripe pineapple, lime, pear, white flower and mineral flavors.",US
6413,US,"This is a very rich Chardonnay. It has complex, lush flavors of pineapples, lemons, limes, oranges and the smoky vanilla notes from 100% new oak. High acidity fortunately provides crisp balance. Almost too much of a good thing, it calls for equally rich fare, such as lobster or Ahi tuna tartare.",US
6414,US,"This is an austere Chardonnay whose minerality and acidity star. That's not to say it's not fruity. It has pineapple and green apple flavors, with oak and lees adding richer complexities. Still, it's a firm, Chablis-style wine, and a very good one that defines the elegant sleekness of the Sonoma Coast.",US
6415,US,"Oaky but simple, with smoky, caramel flavors covering thin notes of pineapple sour candy.",US
6416,US,"Sweet in caramelized oak, this Chard also has jammy flavors of pears and apricots.",US
6417,US,"Big and concentrated, this is a huge mouthful of really tasty juicy. Peach, pineapple and soft tropical flavors combine in a ripe and luscious wine, which puts the fruit well ahead of the butter and toast.",US
6418,US,"Tasted just after bottling, the wine was a little bottle-shocked, but should be fine by Summer 2010. Rich and creamy, with complex tropical fruit, buttered toast, lemondrop candy and honeysuckle flavors. An amazing 111,000 cases were produced.",US
6419,US,"Sharp, tart and thin, with biting green apple fruit flavors. From a high-acid year in Washington, this definitely shows it.",US
6420,US,"Smells a bit underripe, with a whiff of fresh asparagus, and richness is missing in the mouth. The flavors are of citrus fruits, lees, oak and fresh herbs. Nicely dry and crisp, but rather lean.",US
6421,US,"Sharp and spicy, this light Chardonnay hints at almond and coconut, solidly anchored in green apple fruit. The finish thins out quickly, but it's a fine food wine.",US

6427,US,"Very dry, crisp and minerally, with subtle citrus fruit and floral flavors, this Chardonnay suggests Chablis as its model. The elegant structure is likeable.

6428,US,"This outstanding wine is crisp and delicious, absolutely loaded with stone fruits, fresh-cut pineapple, and juicy citrus.",US
6429,US,"The best Hogue Chardonnay in years, this 2007 reserve bottling showcases fully ripened apple, peach and melon fruit flavors in a luscious wrapping of new oak. Butterscotch and a whisp of vanilla carry through the seductive finish.",US
6430,US,Tired and over the hill. It's an old Chardonnay losing its fruit and turning vegetal.,US
6431,US,"Very strongly flavored, very big and powerful in both oak and fruit. Beringer aims for the fences with this massive Chard, which erupts with tropical fruit, ripe pear, baked pastry crust, buttered toast, mineral and cinnamon spice flavors. Not for the faint-hearted, but it's sheer decadence.",US
6432,US,"Powerful in the white Burgundy manner, this 100% Chardonnay was aged in 85% new oak and is very ripe.

Dryness and zesty acidity give it balance and elegance. Now–2010.",US
6433,US,"Rich, vibrant and clean, this Chardonnay shows tremendous appeal in the smoky, leesy, creamy oak coating, with its buttered cinnamon toast and vanilla, as well as in the underlying flavors of green apples, citron, Asian pears and minerals. Beautifully scoured with acidity, it's a beauty.",US

6438,US,"Columbia Crest winemaker Ray Einberger makes four different Chardonnays, this H3 being the newest in the lineup. It has more clean definition, more cut and precision, by far. Yes, there are light tropical fruit flavors and plenty of butter, but it's set up nicely against a firmer, peppery base.",US
6439,US,"Lots of crisp, citrusy acidity in this wine, which brightens the pineapple, orange, lemon and lime flavors. Meanwhile, 100% new oak adds a rich coating of smoky, buttered toast. The wine is dramatic, rather than subtle, and is at its best now.",US

6443,US,"A really terrific Chardonnay, even better than last year's bottling. Of course, the vintage was better, too.

Just beautiful, and at a good price, but only 260 cases produced.",US
6444,US,"With tiers of honeyed apricot, pear, pineapple tart, vanilla and crème brûlée flavors, this is a delicious sweet wine. The residual sugar is more than 13%. Fortunately, all this richness is balanced with crisp coastal acidity.",US
6445,US,"Massively oaked. Some people will find it dominated by the taste of toothpicks, while others will love the butterscotch and caramel. It's certainly delicious. The basic fruits suggest pineapples, papayas, pears and nectarines, wrapped into a texture of pure buttercream.",US

This wine, sourced from Parker's U Block in this famous Santa Maria Valley vineyard, is as rich as any Chardonnay of the vintage—just massive in pineapple, pear and buttered toast flavors.

6449,US,"A flowery Chardonnay with delicate, almost evanescent flavors of buttercup, buttered toast and grapefruit. It seems overly strong in oak and weak in fruit, showing a minerally spine and raw alcohol. Clean and bone dry, but lacks richness and vibrancy.",US
6450,US,"This rich, creamy Chardonnay has fine acidity, while a touch of neutral oak adds a background of buttered toast. But the fruit stars, brimming with papayas, mangos, Meyer lemons, limes and pineapples. The finish is filled with honey, and yet is brisk and dry.",US
6451,US,"As is the custom, the blend includes 5% Viognier, adding some floral scents that lift the aromas. The 2007 is saturated with a candy/caramel flavor, not unpleasant, but quite prominent. It is not, however, flabby or over-ripe; the buttery flavors work smoothly with the pristine apple, pear and melon-flavored fruit, and the wine has a seamless proportionality that lingers into the finish.",US
6452,US,"The 2005 vintage was a very great one for Iron Horse. This 100% Chardonnay reflects the perfect growing conditions. It's dry and especially elegant, with rich brioche, lime and green apple flavors, and a firm minerality in the finish. Drink now.",US
6453,US,"There's no oak on this Chardonnay, but it's so rich, you don't even notice. It's all pure, ripe pineapple, orange and lime fruit, accompanied by tart, clean Green Valley acidity. Tremendously versatile with food.",US
6454,US,"Acidity, dryness and steely minerality characterize this Chard. It has lemon and vanilla flavors that are brisk and clean. It's refreshing to get such an elegant alternative to today's ripe, fruity Chards. Gets better and better as it warms in the glass. Drink this brilliant wine with shellfish, sourdough bread and lots of butter.",US
6455,US,"Labeled Columbia Valley, but actually from Wahluke Slope fruit, this refreshing, tart take on Chardonnay offers a palate-cleansing mix of cucumber, melon and apple-flavored fruit. Crisp acids and a phenolic kick to the finish make this a super food wine.",US
6456,US,"Fruit flavors mix Meyer lemon, yellow apple and just a bare hint of apricot. As with all Owen Roe wines, it has lovely balance, seamless and textural, with crisp definition. The wine was barrel fermented, giving it just a tiny lick of caramel in the finish.",France
6457,US,"A small-production barrel selection from the estate vineyard, this fine wine is brilliantly rich and balanced, proving that Napa Valley can produce excellent Chardonnay. With pineapple, lemon, lime and buttered toast flavors, it's ultraclean in acidity and vibrant in minerals. While it's quite dry, it finishes with a rich flourish of honey.",US
6458,US,"Don't drink this beauty too cold with your lobster, crab or scallops. It has the weight of a noble wine, with minerality and creaminess giving shape and texture to the leesy, yeasty flavors of pineapples, Key lime pie and ripe pear purée. Aged in 40% new French oak, California Chardonnay hardly gets any better than this.",US
6459,US,"Here's a very dry, steely and streamlined Chardonnay. Brims with mineral-infused pineapple tart, buttered toast and honey flavors. Feels wonderfully elegant and balanced, and will pair beautifully with barbecued salmon. The vineyard is located on the so-called Santa Maria bench, one of the region's prime growing areas.",US
6460,US,"Good Chardonnay, rich and ripe and steely. That metallic thing shows up both in the crisp acidity and in the stony, pebbly tang that adds a piquant freshness to the pineapple, lime tart, tangerine and smoky custard-cream flavors.",US
6461,US,"Heavy, sweet and super-oaky, like a liquid infusion of buttered popcorn, pineapple jam and vanilla meringue. Will appeal to many, but purists will find it heavy-handed and manipulated.",US
6462,US,"As sweet and fruity as Gatorade, with a blast of caramelized oak. It's a Chard made in the popular style to appeal to the broad mass of consumers.",US
6463,US,"Very dry, tart and earthy, this is a solid Chardonnay to drink now, at a fair price. It has everyday flavors of peaches and green apples.",US
6464,US,"Made in the ultraripe style that is Williams Selyem Chardonnay, this wine almost needs to be enjoyed by itself as a cocktail. It's explosive in apricot jam, pineapple tart, pear crême brûlée, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors that feel fat and dry and slightly hot in alcohol. Not particularly subtle, but earns points for sheer power.",US
6465,US,"This is a bigger and riper bottle all around than any other Columbia Crest Chardonnays. You get more power—big tropical fruit flavors and even more of the buttered popcorn character than defines the entire lineup—but the tradeoff is that there is less detail, more alcohol, and an over-riding simplicity that risks becoming boring. Grab the H3 if you want complexity; this bottle is for those who want the power.",US
6466,US,"Tastes honey sweet in butterscotch, buttered toast and caramel. The sweetness dominates well ripened pineapple and tangerine flavors. But the fruity power is there. It needs a year or so in the bottle to emerge, and even a brief decant will bring greater harmony to this expressively opulent wine.",US
6467,US,"This is a rich, flamboyant Chardonnay, built on a foundation of superripe pineapple, lime and golden mango fruit and elaborated with sweet, caramelized oak. Bright, zesty Edna Valley acidity balances the opulence.",US
6468,US,"Soft and creamy and very elegant, this Chard has rich flavors of apricot tart, pineapple, Meyer lemon and chalky minerals. Really a well-structured, pulled-together wine of enormous appeal. Should improve through 2012.",US
6469,US,"Just what you want from a Sonoma Coast Chard. It's bone dry, crisp in cool-climate acidity, and elegant, with a minerally tang to the Meyer lemon fruit. Oak barrels bring richer notes of vanilla and buttered toast. Beautiful, and should hold through 2012.",US
6470,US,"H3 is Columbia Crest's line of wines from the Horse Heaven Hills AVA—the winery's home turf—and the wines seem to have a bit more cut and flair than the slightly less expensive Columbia Valley bottlings. Here you will find a more complex blend of fruits—starfruit, apple, melon and a hint of banana—and less focus on butter and toast. In other words, more of a food and sipping wine.",US
6471,US,"A very good Chardonnay, fancy and elegant, although it's a little sharp in the mouth, and lacks a certain hedonistic appeal, especially at this price. Shows dry, oak-inspired flavors of pineapples, green apples and pears, with a firm minerality.",US
6472,US,"Oak dominates this 100% barrel-fermented Chardonnay, giving vanilla crème brûlée and buttered toast notes, but they marry well with the pineapple and pear tart flavors of the fruit. The overall impression is flashy and elaborate. The grapes come from the highly regarded Nielson Vineyard.",US
6473,US,"The grapes come mainly from the Rancho Santa Rosa vineyard, which is a great one, source to many top-scoring Chardonnays over the years. The wine is brisk,  tart and clean, with rich, dramatic flavors of pineapple, lime, honeysuckle and buttered toast. Really elegant and wonderful, and should blossom through early 2012.",US
6474,US,"A super Chardonnay at a very reasonable price. The grapes come from two vineyards, Bien Nacido and Solomon Hills. The wine is fresh and fragrant, with brisk acidity giving a bracing feel to the citrus, nectarine and pear flavors. There's a minerality that adds structural integrity to the richness.",US
6475,US,"Chards from this vineyard always show a typicity of intensely ripe citrus and tropical fruits, backed with bracing acidity and a stony minerality. This bottling threatens to go over the top in apricot sorbet that may have a touch of botrytis, but it wisely pulls back into balance at the last moment. Will gradually lose fruit over the next 10 years, becoming nuttier and drier.",US
6476,US,"Sweet and simple, with strong, honeyed flavors of pineapples, peaches, green apples, vanilla and buttered popcorn. Crisp, coastal acidity fortunately provides balance.",US
6477,US,"This started out as a perfectly nice Chardonnay. It was dry, crisp and balanced, with a minerality under the pineapple and peach flavors. Then the winemaker decided to plaster it with oak, and it tastes like it went through the malolactic fermentation. The quality was lessened.",US
6478,US,"A simple Chardonnay, with likeable pineapple, apple, lime, kiwi and vanilla flavors. Finishes sweet. Seems pricey for what you get.",US
6479,US,"A very elaborate Chardonnay showing flavors of exotic fruits, spices, buttered toast and cream. Charred oak and acidity currently dominate, making the wine a little rigid, but a year or two in bottle should soften and sweeten.",US
6480,US,"Sweetly ripe and oaky, with pineapple marmalade, lemon custard, vanilla and smoky meringue flavors. The alcohol is a refreshingly low 13.9%.",US
6481,US,"This is a flashy Chardonnay, marked by scads of oak that contributes buttered toast and vanilla cream. You find rich fruit flavors of pineapples and golden mangoes, but they struggle to overcome the barrel influence. Still, there's no denying the opulence. Drink now.",US
6482,US,"A lovely Blanc de Blancs, bright and satisfying in lime, vanilla and toast flavors, with the yeasty complexity of a fine sparkling wine. Gains extra points for the smooth quality of the bubbles.",US
6483,US,"Very dry and crisp and minerally. Shows a stony, steely edge to the pineapple, pear and Meyer lemon flavors, with 30% new French oak contributing vanilla, buttered toast and toffee complications. A bit rough now, and should soften and develop bottle complexity after 2010.",US
6484,US,"Very forward in fruit, offering a powerful wave of pineapples, oranges, lemons, limes and peaches. Fortunately, all this richness is dry, and brightened with crisp, tart acidity. Suggests a rich lobster or shrimp risotto.",US
6485,US,"A beautiful Chardonnay at a great price compared to what's out there. Shows brilliantly ripe pineapple, pear and guava flavors, with crisp Central Coast acidity and a bracing minerality. Nice to drink by itself, with shellfish or even with a citrus fruit pastry for dessert.",US
6486,US,"A beautiful Chardonnay notable for its food-friendliness. Strikes a firm path toward dryness and minerality, with suggestions of citrus, peach and vanilla. The racy acidity is wonderful. Defines elegance in Chardonnay, at a good price.",US
6487,US,"Tight, dry and acidic, this Chard is marked by herb and mineral flavors. It is not one of those big, fat, gooey Chards, although it does show elegantly ripe Meyer lemons, buttered toast and spices. Could age for up to five years.",US
6488,US,"Doesn't say so on the label, but the grapes are from Dry Creek Valley. It's a sleek, sophisticated and different sort of Chardonnay, drier and earthier than most, with pleasant pineapple, pear, green apple and herb flavors.",US
6489,US,"This oaky, ripe, fruit-forward Chardonnay will appeal to fans of the California style. It's massive in pineapple jam, lemondrop candy and vanilla crème brûlée flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. A little obvious, but delicious.",US
6490,US,"A very fine Chardonnay showing succulent flavors of pineapples, Meyer lemons and bracing minerals, with a rich honeysuckle and buttered toast sweetness. Flashy, impressive and an incredible value.",US
6491,US,"Great price for a Chardonnay this rich and attactive.Although the alcohol is relatively high, the wine feels balanced, with a proper tension between ripe fruit, oak, alcohol, lees and acidity. Offers savory flavors of lemondrop candy, pineapple tart and buttered toast.",US
6492,US,"Run, don't walk to buy up cases of this beautiful, well-priced Chardonnay. It's rich and sumptuous in vanilla oak and lees-inspired flavors of pineapples, pears and lime tart. Easy to find, with production of 17,496 cases.",US
6493,US,"An intense, nervy Chardonnay, grown on the estate along the Silverado Trail. Shows good acidity and a minerality that makes it elegant and firm, giving a bracing structure to the oak-inspired flavors of pineapple tart, peaches and cream.",US
6494,US,"A flamboyant, crisp Chardonnay made in the popular style of elaborately toasty oak and very ripe fruit, which combine to offer an almost pastry-like dessert taste. Floods the mouth with pineapple tart, Meyer lemondrop and vanilla flavors, with suggestions of kiwis, limes and green apples. Delicious and appealing.",US
6495,US,"This is an elaborate, oaky Chardonnay made in the popular style that has made California Chard such a success. It's rich in pineapple jam, apricot, buttered toast, vanilla and leesy flavors, and grows better as it warms in the glass.",US
6496,US,"Ripeness of fruit and tart acidity combine to make this a fine, drily elegant coastal Chardonnay. Beyond the great structure are savory flavors of pineapples and green apples, with rich notes of honeysuckle flower and a grounding tug of minerality.",US
6497,US,"A very good, delicious Chardonnay that's easy to drink, and whose richness suggests shrimp, scallops, lobster and similarly rich fare. Dry and crisp in acidity, it wows with pineapple marmalade, crème brûlée, buttered toast, vanilla, honeysuckle and mineral flavors, brightened with zesty acidity.",US
6498,US,"Crisp acidity saves this rather sweet, oaky wine by giving it a clean mouthfeel. The flavors are of pineapple and apple juice, honey and vanilla caramel.",US
6499,US,"Light, watery and thin, with simple lemon and green apple flavors, and plenty of acidity.",US
6500,US,"Sweet and simple, with flavors of apricot, pineapple, peach and pear juice.",US
6501,US,"This is crystal clear, fleshy and ripe, yet still graceful and refined. Mixed stone fruits are cut with yellow apple, the acids are natural and perfectly integrated. The wine was barrel fermented in a 50/50 mix of new and neutral, and there is just a hint of caramel in the extended finish.",US
6502,US,"This is Martin Ray's best non-reserve Chard in years. In fact, it's as good as some of their reserves. It shows real richness, with fancy oak and lees influences and complex the peach and pear fruit flavors.",US
6503,US,"Almost a repeat of the ‘05, in which the oak dominated everything else. Those waves of caramel and buttered toast taste good, and together with the pineapples and pears, give the wine an exotic taste of some creamy, spicy, honey-rich mashed fruit pudding.",US
6504,US,"The winery turned to Edna Valley for this '07 Chard, which shows all the fine qualities of that Central Coast region. The wine is high in acidity, dry and ultra-clean, with powerful flavors of golden kiwi fruit, limes and vanilla honey.",US
6505,US,"With 15% residual sugar, this dessert wine is decidedly sweet in apricot, pineapple, pear, honey, vanilla fudge and smoky flavors, with a brisk minerality. It maintains a zesty balance, with crisp acidity.",US
6506,US,"A good, rich, oaky Chardonnay that will satisfy your sweet tooth. It's bursting in ripe pineapple jam, lime, pear and buttered toast flavors, with clean, zesty acidity for balance.",US
6507,US,"This has 5% Sauvignon Blanc in the blend. It's done in all stainless steel; the Chardonnay is tight and spicy, with melon and apple flavors. There's a vitamin pill streak that comes up also, and then it leads into some almond flavors in the finish. It's almost like a northern Italian style, with almond and pepper and relatively high acid. Good food wine.",US
6508,US,"An extravagant Chardonnay, rich in buttered toast and vanilla cream from oak barrels, and opulent fruit flavors of ripe, sweet pineapples, golden mangoes and pears. The sur lie aging shows up in a creamy, yeasty richness. Holding this wine for a year or two will not harm it.",US
6509,US,"Tasted in the Spring of 2009, this Chard was immature, marked by fresh fruit acidity and flavors, as well as unintegrated oak. But it's quite good, and just needs time to allow the grilled pineapple, crème brûlée and buttered toast flavors to come together with the alcohol. Best 2010–2013.",US
6510,US,"Crisply dry but very rich, even exotic, in fruit, this Chardonnay is a good value for the money. It's flamboyant in tropical pineapple jam, pears, vanilla custard and buttered toast, with a stony minerality.",US
6511,US,"A big improvement over the 2007, Stephens' '08 is rich and ripe. It brims with pineapple, buttered toast, vanilla and cinnamon flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Easy to drink, and delicious through the finish.",US
6512,US,"The vintage was particularly successful for Patz & Hall, which achieved ripeness and balancing acidity with a seemingly effortless touch. This wine is brilliantly clean and extraordinarily rich in pineapples, Meyer lemons, sweet limes and minerals. Grows better as it warms in the glass.",US
6513,US,"Morgan makes one of the best, most powerful Santa Lucia Chardonnays, and this less expensive bottling is a good approximation of their top tier. It's strong and potent, with cool-climate acidity framing mouthwatering pineapple jam, Key lime pie, kiwi fruit, white peach and vanilla cream flavors.",US
6514,US,"Very rich, reflecting 100% barrel fermentation in partial new oak and 100% malolactic fermentation. Under the creamy lees and buttered toast are scads of pineapples, pears and papayas. The grapes come from the Nielson Vineyard.",US
6515,US,"This is a strong, oaky, ripe Chardonnay, grown on a mountain better known for Cabernet. It's powerful and intense in pineapple tart, pear marmalade, Meyer lemon and lime flavors that have been liberally oaked, and it shows the creamy influence of lees. Not particularly subtle, it's a wine you don't want to drink too cold.",US
6516,US,"A disjointed Chardonnay, with aromas of apricots, grapefruits, limes and wood. Finishes dry and somewhat sour in acidity.",France
6517,US,"A simple Chardonnay, with a soapy mouthfeel, lemony fruit and a hint of almond in the finish.",US
6518,US,"Too sweet and oaky for comfort, with caramelized flavors of pineapple and apple juice that finish with a white sugar aftertaste.",US
6519,US,"Slightly sweet, with simple apple and mango juice flavors and a veneer of oak-like vanillins and caramel. Crisp acidity helps to make the finish clean.",US
6520,US,"Overripe, with apricot and pear flavors, although it's dry. The wine feels heavy and syrupy in the mouth, lacking vibrancy.",US
6521,US,"Sugary sweet and simple, with flavors like a blend of the juices of pineapples, apples and pears. It's also soft, which makes it a little cloying.",US
6522,US,"Almost like a young Sauvignon Blanc, it's so acidic and juicy in citrus, lime peel, green apple, tangerine, fig and jasmine tea flavors. The wine was fermented entirely in stainless steel and did not undergo malolactic fermentation. Very enjoyable, and something different in Chardonnay.",US
6523,US,"Racy and pure, this Chard shows the bright lime, lemon and kiwi flavors of Edna Valley Chards, with a sleek undergirding of steely minerals. It's crisp and dry, although smoky oak lends caramel and vanilla notes.",US
6524,US,"You can almost smell the minerals and acids in this Chardonnay. The flavors verify the aroma, adding fruitier notes of limes, sweet apples and white peaches, complexed with the creamy, smoky nuances of new oak and sur lies aging.",US
6525,US,"A spectacular Chard, massive and pure in laser-focused Meyer lemon, Key lime pie, papaya, pepper and smoky vanilla flavors, with the most bracing minerality, a real lick of gunmetal. Brilliant now, and the firm structure should let it age smoothly for a good six years.",US
6526,US,"Shows the crisp elegance and clean balance this bottling is known for, with ripe citrus, apricot, tropical fruit and mineral flavors, accented by rich new oak. It's fun to play with this Chard, let it warm up in the glass and see how it changes over the course of a dinner. That's the mark of a great table wine.",US
6527,US,"This regional bottling has been a strong suit of Testarossa over the years, a best-barrel blend from their far-flung coastal empire of vineyards. It's very rich in apricot, pineapple, honeysuckle and smoky oak flavors, and finishes dry and spicy. Shows an elegant complexity that should develop over the next six years.",US
6528,US,"The winery has been doing a great job with their Chard lately. It's a mountain wine and shows typical concentration, with very pure, ripe flavors of peaches, pears and pineapples. It's right up there at the threshold of too oaky and sweet, though it stops just short.",US
6529,US,"A rich, direct Chard that leaves little to the imagination. It offers a sunburst of oak-inspired tropical fruit flavors that are very ripe and jammy, in the modern California style.",US
6530,US,"Here's a ripely fruity Chardonnay that pulls out all the stops to achieve opulence, and largely succeeds. Defines the modern style of winemaking, with extracted pineapple, orange and caramelized oak flavors, wrapped into a creamy, leesy texture that's brightened with zingy acidity. Drink now.",US
6531,US,"Wow—delicious, the best yet. Lots of pineapple from the 75% Celilo fruit, very crisp and lightly butterscotchy. Big but not heavy, with alcohol in the mid-13% range. The wine fills in the midpalate nicely, weaving together rock, metal, butter and tropical fruit flavors in equal proportions. Good length also.",US
6532,US,"Shows the extreme dryness, crisp acidity, flowers and minerality that often mark Carneros Chadonnays, which makes it elegant and sleek. With a touch of Meyer lemons and limes, it rises to richness. Drink now.",US
6533,US,"This is a very pure, fresh and clean Chardonnay. While it's rich in tropical fruit, pear, green apple and smoky oak flavors, it's also well balanced. Shows brisk, citrusy acidity and a firm stream of minerals.",US
6534,US,"Chappellet's secret is that Cabernet Sauvignon isn't the only thing they know how to do. Granted, their Chards have off years, but in general they make one of the valley's best Chardonnays. The 2008 is right up there with the '04 and '07. Ripe in pineapples, peaches and pears, it avoids the herbaceousness that can mar Napa Chardonnay. Very fine.",US
6535,US,"A pure, clean Chardonnay whose dry richness is balanced with cool-climate acidity and a citrus streak almost like Sauvignon Blanc. Shows pineapple and pear flavors that indicate the varietal, but then crisp, tartly acidic lemongrass and grapefruits kick in. The result is wonderfully food-friendly. Easy to find, with 10,600 cases produced.",US
6536,US,"A beautiful Chardonnay that shows ripe, long hangtime fruit flavors of pineapples, apricots, peaches and papayas, offset with clean acidity. Shows a touch of oak. Will satisfy Chard fans, and is super food-friendly with grilled salmon, shrimp, scallops.",US

6538,US,"Simple, with fruit punch-sweet pineapple and lemon flavors. High acidity makes it a little sour.",US
6539,US,"Very powerful, very strong, almost overwhelming in the sheer wealth of fruit and oak, but balanced with acidity. Winemaker Bob Cabral himself calls it “concentrated.” It detonates on the palate with an almost dessert wine quality of lemons, pineapples, honey, vanilla and minerals, but it's totally dry. Will hold for perhaps six years.",US
6540,US,"The grapes from this vineyard in the Petaluma Gap typically get very ripe, while maintaining the acidity needed for balance. Tandem's ‘05 is richly elegant and riper than in the past, with opulent flavors of nectarines, candied peaches and pears, marzipan, honeysuckle, butterscotch and cinnamon. Should stay at its peak for several years.",US
6541,US,"Dry, crisp and minerally, this Chard has intensely pure flavors of ripe white peach, pear, green apple and pineapple that have a stony scour of cold steel. It's the opposite of the modern style of oaky fruit bomb Chards, with an elegant integrity that's food-friendly and ageworthy. Fine now, and should do interesting things for a decade.",US
6542,US,"Concentrated and textural, this puts bright fruit flavors of apple and pear up front, adding lush caramel from fermentation in Burgundy barrels. Completely non-interventionist (no acid or water additions), this immaculate wine brings the winery's customary bold aromas into play, following with the crisply defined fruit, rind and barrel notes. The finish is like caramel-dipped apples.",US
6543,US,"Shows the typicity of the vineyard, an angular, minerally wine with crisp acids and concentrated flavor. The tastes of white peaches, pineapples and tangerines are edged with zesty spices. Finishes with vanilla-honey coating of toasty oak.",US
6544,US,"Lots of richness in this dry, minerally Chardonnay. It has forward flavors of peaches, pears, baked green apples and flint, while lots of new oak contributes honey and caramel notes.",US
6545,US,"Nutty and custardy, this is a full-bodied Chardonnay that emphasizes Chardonnay's textural richness when augmented by barrel fermentation and lees stirring. Toasted hazelnuts are balanced by hints of citrus. Drink now.",US
6546,US,"Talbott's style is always exotic and eccentric, with the grapes tasting so ripe, they have an almost botrytised, apricotty flavor. So it is with this '06, which also brims with grilled pineapple and sweet smoky oak. Best now.",US
6547,US,"If you like lots of smoky vanilla and buttercream on a big, California-ripe Chardonnay that's stuffed with pineapples and mangoes, then this is the wine for you. It's direct and dry and crisp, at a fair price.",US
6548,US,"This estate-grown Chardonnay opens with lots of new oak aromas, excellent fruit material, with Meyer lemon, yellow apple, hints of white peach. The phenolics give the wine some excellent texture, and it has a long and smooth finish.",US
6549,US,"Good tropical fruit, green apple and buttercream flavors in this bone-dry wine. It has a slightly rugged, earthy taste as well, of dried herbs and tobacco. A sound Chardonnay.",US
6550,US,"There's lots to like about this cool-climate Chardonnay, from the ripe pineapple, kiwi and lime flavors to the rich touch of lees and vanilla. It has a sharp cut of acidity that's almost Champagne-like, and calls for extremely rich fare to balance. Try with shrimp risotto.",US
6551,US,"Made in the modern, ripe style, but with a greater degree of finesse than you might expect at this price. The wine is dry and crisp and minerally, with a clean mouthfeel, yet offers rich flavors of pineapples, green apples and peaches. Easy to find, with more than 12,000 cases produced.",US
6552,US,"Smells bright, citrusy and clean, an impression followed in the mouth, where intricate flavors of pineapple, lemondrop candy and Key lime pie turn spicy on the finish. The acidity is brisk; the wine did not go through malolactic fermentation. Just shows that a great Chardonnay doesn't need oak, although sur lies aging gives it a notable creaminess.",US
6553,US,"A massive Chardonnay, rich in fruit and oak. Shows long, decadent flavors of roasted pineapples, nectarines, honeysuckle, vanilla, buttered toast and meringue, dusted with cinnamon spice and brown sugar. Structure is fortunately provided by crisp acidity and even a framework of wood tannins. Now–2013.",US
6554,US,"Shows the bright, citrusy acidity and ripe fruit the vineyard is known for. Really quite an exotic Chard, with waves of papaya, persimmon, Meyer lemon, Asian spice, buttercream and vanilla smoke flavors. Should develop well. Drink now–2012.",US
6555,US,"This is just the second vintage of the Lumière Chardonnay from this rising star winery, and it is already causing a buzz. Washington produces very few high end white wines that would be natural companions to its reds on a restaurant wine list. This tight, precise, concentrated and focused Chardonnay fills that need. Though loaded with tropical and stone fruit flavors, this retains its acidic spine and finishes with plenty of toasty, buttered nut, barrel flavors.",US
6556,US,"Rich and creamy, with fruit-forward flavors of pineapple jam, oranges, ripe peaches, vanilla and buttered toast. Crisp acidity gives balance and clean liveliness.",US
6557,US,"A richly fruity, tropical-fruit-scented Chardonnay that offers plenty of weight and fruit at a reasonable tariff. Bits of butter, dried spices and citrus accent the ripe fruit, which finishes dry and crisp.",US
6558,US,"Rich and 100% barrel fermented, this delicious Chardonnay is thick and luscious, with buttered nuts, pineapple and candied citrus; a really concentrated wine with exceptional depth and density for the price. The oak is present and accounted for, but not at all intrusive; it's really a generously fruity wine with a big mid-palate. Outstanding value.",US
6559,US,"Oak dominates this wine. The idea seems to have been Chablis, to judge by the dryness and citrusy minerality. But the char and toast are very strong and the underlying richness isn't there for balance.",France
6560,US,"Previous vintages tasted more balanced than this super-oaky one. The wood erupts from the glass, suggestive of caramel, buttered popcorn, vanilla cream pie and charcoal, overwhelming what seems to be a perfectly nice wine. Some folks will love it. Others will find it the poster child of overoaked California Chard.",US
6561,US,"The new oak stands out and dominates this Chard, and while the toasty vanilla, caramel and charred woodsap flavors are pleasant, they overpower the modest pineapple and apple fruit.",US
6562,US,"Rich and oaky, with crisp acidity framing flavors of pineapple crème brûlée, yellow apricot jam, buttered toast and meringue. Flamboyant, but controlled and elegant. Drink now.",US
6563,US,"Buena Vista has a good reputation for this bottling, and the great '07 vintage has resulted in another fine Chardonnay, at a good price. Racy in acidity, the wine shows mineral-infused citrus fruit, apple and honeysuckle notes that finish with a touch of off-dry sweetness.",France
6564,US,"This series of wines, under the Badger Mountain label of Powers winery, uses grapes that are organically grown. Minimal sulfites are added. This a fresh, forward, deliciously fruity Chardonnay, loaded with a classy mix of apple, pear and peach fruit. A great springtime sipper.",US
6565,US,"This is Geyser Peak's barrel-fermented Chardonnay. It shows classic Alexander Valley ripeness, with rich tropical fruit, green apple, pear, buttered popcorn and vanilla flavors, accented with racy acidity. Very nice now with roast salmon, crab or a simple roast chicken.",US

6567,US,"Good price for such a nice Chardonnay from the Santa Rita Hills. The wine is very dry and crisp in acidity, with a bracing mouthfeel that offers rich, oak-inspired flavors of pineapples, pears and green apples. Nice now with Ahi tuna tartare or grilled salmon.",US
6568,US,"Dramatically rich and ripe, a bells and whistles Chardonnay made in the white Burgundy style. It's flamboyant in pineapple, nectarine, guava and oak- and lees-influenced buttered toast, cream and vanilla crème brûlée, but it's also very acidic and dry, which provides balance and elegance. Fine now and for 3 or 4 years.",US
6569,US,"Chardonnay doesn't get much richer or riper than this. Explodes with grilled pineapple, lemondrop, smoky meringue, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors, brightened and boosted by crisp, citrusy cool-climate acidity. Racy and clean and complex, it should develop bottle nuance over the next four years.",US
6570,US,"Simi winemaker Steve Reeder has produced an utterly delicious wine with this barrel-fermented beauty, the best nonreserve Chard from the winery in nearly 10 years. It shows flamboyant, complex flavors of tropical fruits, green apples, pears, butterscotch and smoky vanilla, with crisp, clean Russian River acidity. This is a good price, and the wine should be easy to find, with nearly 20,000 cases produced.",US
6571,US,"The fruit stars in this tasty Chardonnay. Pineapples, pears, mangoes, green apples and Key lime pie dance on the palate. A touch of oak adds vanilla cream and buttered toast. Drink now.",US
6572,US,"There's an earthiness to this Chard, reminiscent of sweet fresh sage, along with savory flavors of oranges, pineapples and vanilla. It's a nice, easy wine for drinking now.",US
6573,US,"Crisp and spicy, with oak and lees influences, yet lacking a bit in fruity concentration. With one-fifth Pinot Gris, the wine shows modest citrus, apple and floral flavors.",US
6574,US,"Shows rich flavors and a creamy texture, with pineapple-infused crème brûlée, buttered cinnamon bun and honey. Could be more focused and crisper in structure.",US
6575,US,"Steely, crisp and very dry, this Chard has a savory mineral underpinning to the lime, Meyer lemon, green apple and pear flavors. Shows real style and finesse through the long finish.",US
6576,US,"This wine really flaunts its stuff (and its oak aging) in its rich, creamy body and intensely luscious profile. Aromas and flavors of buttered brioche, baked apples, butter and light smoky spice fill out the nose and mouth, with notes of sweet vanilla-infused spice lingering throughout the long finish. Oaky, sure, but well balanced and delicious, too.",US
6577,US,"A really good Chardonnay that shows the classic acidity and dryness of the Sonoma Coast, with complex, pleasurable flavors. Pineapples, pears, apricots and guavas are the fruits, enriched with sweet oak, in a dry, balanced and elegant wine that could develop bottle nuance over the next 2–4 years.",US
6578,US,"Made in a leaner, crisper style than many Chards nowadays, this Chardonnay trades power for elegance. It's almost like a Sauvignon Blanc, with citrusy acids framing flavors of limes, pineapples and green apples that have a minerally edge. New French oak adds just the right touch of richness.",US
6579,US,"This massive, explosive Chardonnay is marked by extremely ripe pineapple, pear and peach fruit, accented with lots of sweet, caramelized oak. It's a potent, high alcohol wine whose buttered popcorn flavors are complex by crisp acidity and minerals. A bit obvious, but a fine example of its style.",US
6580,US,"Made in the Sleepy Hollow style, extraordinarily ripe, almost botrytized in apricot and honey flavors like a dessert wine, except that it's bone dry. Really epitomizes this vineyard and corner of Monterey, where Chard ripens to beautifully while maintaining acidity.",US
6581,US,"Creamy with a smooth streak of rich butterscotch, this is a very appealing wine that seems to gather strength as it slides through the mouth. It hits a whopping 15.3% alcohol, and yet retains a silky feel and a nice mix of peach, apricot and papaya fruits. It just goes on and on, almost like a dessert wine without the sugar.",US
6582,US,"A creamy texture houses vivid flavors of pineapple jam, lemon pie, vanilla custard and buttered toast in this rich wine. It's an opulent Chardonnay made for elegant fare.",US
6583,US,"This is a blend of several vineyards from throughout the sprawling Sonoma Coast region. It shows crisp, upfront acidity that makes the wine tart, and lasts through the dry finish. Flavor-wise, it's all about pears, enriched with toasty oak.",US
6584,US,"Shows the brisk, tart acidity that always shows up in wines from this little Central Coast appellation. Also demonstrates the bright flavors of limes, kiwis and pineapples that mark an Edna Valley Chardonnay. Not subtle, but deliciously drinkable.",US
6585,US,"Very dry, crisp and minerally, a subtle wine with some bottle age that shows real complexity and finesse. Not for fruit-forward fans, its pineapple, pear and herb flavors are drying out, leading to interesting, old-wine, honey-and-cashew nuances. Drink right away, before it dies.",US
6586,US,"Made in the stylish cult manner of exceptionally ripe pineapple, kiwi and pear fruit flavors, lavishly oaked, this Chard will please fans of the style. One wishes it were more sophisticated and complex, but lots of people will ooh and aah over its sheer power.",US
6587,US,"Light and frothy in the glass, this beautifully perfumed dry sparkling is redolent of orange blossoms, apples and pears. A blend of Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier and Chardonnay, there's a delicious hint of buttery cashew nut and bitter almond amidst the floral, fresh apple and lemon flavors.",US
6588,US,"Super-rich in vanilla and smoky caramelized oak, and ripe in pineapples, peaches and apples, this is a powerful Chardonnay. It's dramatic now in sheer strength, but not an ager, so drink now.",US
6589,US,"Another massive, dramatically rich Chardonnay from Williams Selyem. Purists will find it ponderous, but there's no denying the wealth of pineapple tart, orange custard, crème brûlée, butterscotch and vanilla flavors. Lobster comes to mind as a natural partner.",US
6590,US,"A very ripe, oaky Chardonnay made in a popular style to appeal to fans of richness. Swamps the palate with pineapple tart, pear marmalade, crème brûlée, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors, balanced with crisp acidity.",US
6591,US,"Soft and simple, with canned apple and pear flavors and a heavy dose of sweet, charry oak.",US
6592,US,"Sweet in oak and simple, with jammy apricot, pineapple and gingerbread flavors.",US
6593,US,"This is a very ripe, fruity Chardonnay, and also a very oaky one. It tastes like apricot brûlée. It will satisfy fans of this California style, but is really fairly simple.",US
6594,US,"Shows a Chablis-like steely, minerally dryness, with subtle notes of lemons, limes and grapefruits. Marked by firm acids, it's an elegant wine of great structure and integrity, meant for drinking now.",US
6595,US,"Very rich, dry and crisp in acidity, a Chardonnay that feels fine from your first sip through the spicy finish. Made with 35% new French oak, and aged eight months on the lees, it's drinking beautifully now, with pear, pineapple, vanilla custard and buttered toast flavors. Just lovely.",US
6596,US,"Very pleasant, relatively light, showing a pretty mix of citrus and tropical fruit, fresh cream, light toast and a hint of cinnamon. The alcohol rests at 14.1% but feels a bit lighter, and the wine has a pleasing ripeness without becoming fat or heavy.",US
6597,US,"With high alcohol and 100% new French oak, this wine could easily be clumsy, but it isn't. It defines the ripe California style. It's a little hot, but so massive in flavors of pineapples, lemondrop candy, crème brûlée and sweet buttered toast, you can't help but be impressed. A winery and wine to watch.",US
6598,US,"Here's a bright, crisp young Chard. It's bone dry and vibrant in Meyer lemon, tropical fruit, spice and vanilla smoke flavors, with a keen, tangy streak of minerality. Tremendously versatile as a food wine due to its balance and finesse.",US
6599,US,"This Chard is soft and sweet, very ripe in jammy white and yellow fruit flavors, and has a smoky-oak coating. It's made in a style meant to appeal to consumers.",France
6600,US,"Sweet new oak and jammy tropical fruit co-star in this Chard, offering immediate gratification but little complexity or follow-through. Needs a defter, more sensitive hand, especially at this price.",US
6601,US,"Showing lemon zest and yellow apricot flavors, this bone-dry Chard has serious underpinnings of minerals. It's reminiscent of a good French Chablis, and may require time in the cellar.",US
6602,US,"It's all in your face in this modern-style Chardonnay. Vastly ripe pineapple jam and tangerine flavors, enhanced with sweet vanilla oak and creamy lees, flood the mouth, making the wine superrich, although it's bright in citrusy acidity. Ready to drink now.",US
6603,US,"A light style, with straightforward citrus and green apple fruit, this widely available Chardonnay is clean and generic, unoaked and bone dry.",US
6604,US,"There's quite a generous amount of oak on this medium-weight white, but it's well done in the style. Butter, vanilla and pear are the opening notes followed by caramel on the viscous palate. Nutty, short-to-medium finish. Drink now to one year.",US
6605,US,"This very rich Chardonnay oozes showy flavors of pineapples, pears and golden mangoes, with winemaking notes of buttered toast, crème brûlée and a slight taste of yeast. It's not particularly subtle, projecting power instead.",US
6606,US,"Classy Chardonnay. Shows ripe, savory pineapple, Meyer lemon, lime and mineral flavors, brightened with crisp acidity and enriched with a touch of sweet oak. As rich as it is, it feels elegant and refined in the mouth.",US
6607,US,"If you like your Chards Burgundian style, you love the creamy complexity of this one. Only slightly oaked, it bursts with pineapple custard, green apple butter, guava, crème brûlée, vanilla, toast and cinnamon flavors, with a very long, honey-spicy finish.",US
6608,US,"The oak really stands out, so if you're sensitive to that, avoid. But others, including this reviewer, will find the toasty vanilla, meringue, butterscotch and char flavors perfectly in keeping with the ripe tropical fruit, pear and Meyer lemon flavors.",US
6609,US,"From Raymond, a solid Chardonnay at a fair price for the quality. Bone dry and crisp, it has modest pineapple, pear and kiwi flavors, girded with a tangy minerality.",US
6610,US,"This is a strongly flavored Chardonnay. The fruit is extremely forward, veering from oranges and pineapples into apricots and even suggesting a touch of botrytis. The oak sticks out, all vanilla and butterscotch. It's not exactly an unbalanced wine, but it is ungainly. Drink now.",US
6611,US,"As comfortable as an old shoe, the Grand Estates Chardonnay from Columbia Crest delivers broad, open flavors of buttered fruit – almost like biting into a slice of apple pie, crust and all. Hard to argue with it, all 160,000 cases strong.",US
6612,US,"Oaky, with dominating aromas and flavors of butterscotch, vanilla custard and meringue. Underneath all that are ripe pineapple and golden mango flavors.",US
6613,US,"Very high in acidity, with a mouth-cleansing scour, this Chard carries lemon, lime, pineapple and floral notes. It has a honeyed creaminess that gives body and fatness to the structure.",US
6614,US,"A nice Russian River Chard, firm in acidic minerals, with an edge of dried herbs and wood char to the pineapple, green apple and cream caramel flavors.",US
6615,US,"The winery calls this unoaked Chardonnay “Homage to Chablis,” presumably because it's a high-acid, low alcohol wine whose main flavors are of minerals, with subtle elements of citrus zest and pear. It's a connoisseurs' wine that requires some understanding to appreciate. Sommeliers will love it, but it's hard to find. Only 120 cases produced.",US
6616,US,"Not much oak is evident in this polished Chardonnay. What stars is fruit, all pineapples, pears, tangerines, green apples and papayas, and the acidity that makes it all bright and clean. Great with pasta in a butter sauce with garlic and pepper.",US
6617,US,"Very ripe, rich and oaky, made solidly in the California style. Doesn't leave much to the imagination, but rewards for decadent pineapple, pear, crème brûlée, buttered popcorn and vanilla flavors.",US
6618,US,"A fuller, richer, more broadly fruity version of the winery's Two Vines offering, this crowd-pleasing Chardonnay slathers the palate with buttery brioche, apple and Asian pear. A little more acidity would help; give it a chill to compensate.",US
6619,US,"Offers a tremendous burst of ripe green apples, bosc pears and Meyer lemons, brightened with the crisp acidity of cool Green Valley. Also, tinges of vanilla and cream, despite being unoaked.",US
6620,US,"Oaky, with butterscotch and smoky caramel-honey flavors standing out over the underlying pineapples, oranges and minerals. Finishes dry and crisp. Drink now.",US
6621,US,"Very dry, with mouth-watering acidity, but the palate also searches for a little more fruit than the wine offers. Still, the pineapples, peaches and apricots are pleasant enough.",US
6622,US,"Lots of oaky richness in this dry, crisp Chardonnay. It has high acidity and a dusty minerality, but also a thick coat of sweet, butterscotchy oak and powerful flavors of lemons, limes, pineapples and exotic tropical fruits. Drink over the next four years.",US
6623,US,"Year after year, Bonterra crafts splendidly pure varietal wines, from organically-grown grapes, and in large quantities that make them easy to find. The '06 Chard is delicious in pineapple, sweet Meyer lemon, tangerine, lime and caramelized vanilla oak flavors that finish clean and long. What a super value.",US
6624,US,"This wine in a box is made using a faucet technology just like your sink, which feels weird, but it's easy to use and keeps the wine sound. The wine itself is serviceable, with sweet, candied flavors of pineapple and lemon Lifesavers.",US
6625,US,"Dry and balanced, this young wine has a steely mineral tang to the fruitier flavors of ripe yellow apricots, tangerines and baked green apples. Oak adds smoky, spicy wood notes. A very nice Chard at a good price.",US
6626,US,"Made in a spare, angular style, this has citrus zest, mineral and pear flavors, brightened by acidity. It's an elegant wine with a creamy, buttery texture.",US
6627,US,"An interesting Chardonnay that does not quite all come together. Lemons, orange peel and other lively citrus aromas are mixed in with flavors of grain—cracker, oatmeal, and so on. The finish confuses rather than blends.",US
6628,US,"A sleekly dry, minerally Chardonnay that shows a fine, steely structure, yet doesn't stint on fruit. The pineapple, pear and flowery honeysuckle flavors are accented with richer touches of buttered toast from oak barrels.",US
6629,US,"A blend from two well-regarded vineyards, this Chardonnay is ultrarich in pineapple, mango, pear and green apple fruit flavors that are liberally accented with sweet, caramelized oak. Crisp acidity and a steely minerality fortunately provide balance. Drink now.",US
6630,US,"Except for some excessive sweetness, this is a brilliant wine. It's bright and clean in acidity, offering pineapple, lime and golden mango flavors that go on and on into the spicy finish. No question how delicious it is, but could be a bit drier and firmer.",US
6631,US,"Made in the popular style of ripe fruit and plenty of oak, this Chard is rich in pineapple, pear, buttered toast and vanilla flavors. It's fortunately balanced with crisp acidity and a touch of minerals. Drink with rich fare, like lobster salad.",US
6632,US,"Crisp, vital acidity marks this ultrarich wine with a mouthwatering bite of tartness. The flavors are enormous, suggesting long hang time fruit that ripened to pineapple, lime and mango perfection. Not particularly subtle, but flamboyant in the California style.",US
6633,US,"There's a flowery note to this Chardonnay, which is dry, crisply acidic and strong in flavor in its youth. Brims with pineapple tart filling, Key lime pie, orange zest, honeysuckle, daffodil and smoky, vanilla-oak flavors, with a creamy, yeasty richness. Would benefit from greater restraint and subtlety, which may come after 3–5 years in the bottle. If you drink it now, give it a good decanting.",US
6634,US,"Delivers lots of bang for the buck. Shows real Chardonnay character, with rich vanilla cream-infused flavors of ripe pineapples, pears, sautéed bananas, buttered toast and honey. At this price, it's a fantastic buy that can stand next to Chards costing far more.",US
6635,US,"This is a dry Chardonnay marked by pronounced acids and steely minerals. The underlying flavors are of exotic pineapples and guavas, while new oak and lees aging add richer notes of buttered toast and sour cream. Drink now.",US
6636,US,"Here is another fine effort from Columbia Crest that captures some spice and keeps the fruit bright and fresh. Apple and citrus flavors, sharp and tangy, run up against lots of barrel toast. The finish is loaded with baking spices and lightly touched with candied orange peel.",US
6637,US,"Tastes like the mashed pulp of ultra-ripe peaches, pears and limes, sprinkled with vanilla and cinnamon and brightened with crisp, zesty Central Coast acidity.",US
6638,US,"Firm and minerally, with zippy acids framing oak-touched mango, pear and sautéed banana flavors. Not a big Chard, but an elegant, crisply dry one.",US
6639,US,"Very forward and mouth-filling in pineapples, mangoes, nectarines, guavas and figs. Yet the wine is dry and crisp. Shows flamboyance rather than complexity, and will appeal to fans of this hedonistic style.",US
6640,US,"Biscuit, burnt toast, and a hint of rubber dominate the nose. The fruit is light and somewhat buried—a little melon, unripe peach and pineapple. Perhaps too much barrel exposure, or over-toasted barrels?",US
6641,US,"The bottle states upfront that the wine is barrel fermented and aged though it's easy to figure out by the aromas of vanilla, sawdust and singed popcorn that define the nose. Some pineapple and malted milk tones peek through on the palate but the fruit is thoroughly trumped by the oak on the finish. Drink up.",US
6642,US,"This is a perfect go-to, everyday Chardonnay, solid and light, if a bit unexciting. The fruit flavors of apple and melon are gentle and soft, and the oak treatment delicately handled. You get a little bit of buttered popcorn, but it's not a night out at the movies.",US
6643,US,"Here's a brisk, bright and very flavorful Chardonnay for drinking with rich fare, like crab, pork, scallops or chicken in a buttery cream sauce. It's strong in acidity, with honeyed, creamy flavors of kiwi fruit, limes, pineapples and vanilla.",US
6644,US,"Shows the purity of flavor and structure that Bonterra wines are famous for. Ultraclean and racy in acidity, this Chardonnay stars ripe varietal flavors of pineapples, oranges and limes. A touch of oak adds welcome richness.",US
6645,US,"So fresh and inviting with aromas of apple cider, pear slices and pineapple core. More of the same unfolds in the mouth with soft accents of smoke appearing on the end of the finish. Balanced with medium weight and acidity; an excellent option for outdoor grilling, at an attractive price.",US
6646,US,"The aromas and tastes of oak dominate this Chardonnay, with buttered toast and sweet caramel riding high over the pineapple, mango and pear flavors. But crisp acidity provides needed balance, and there's a fine minerality that gives a tang of stone. A good price for a Chard this complicated.",US
6647,US,"Very ripe and bright in lemon, lime, apricot, apple, pear, vanilla, buttered toast and honeysuckle flavors. The acidity is strong and bright. It's a good, rich Chardonnay despite needing more subtlety and complexity.",US
6648,US,"Clean and crisp in acidity, with a rich overlay of smoky, caramelized oak, this Chardonnay has appealing pineapple, peach and lime fruit flavors. There's a honey sweet finish, although the wine itself is totally dry. Good price for all this opulence.",US
6649,US,"Sweet in smoky oak, with sweet cream flavors, this pleasant Chardonnay is rich in pineapples. Yet it's dry, with a minerally tang and fine acidity. Drink now.",US
6650,US,"The oak and lees really stand out here, giving smoky, yeasty notes to the pineapple, pear and citron flavors. This stylishly dry Chard is elegant and spicy on the finish.",US
6651,US,"Fans of superfruity, oaky, big Chards will love this one. The grapes came from outside the true Santa Lucia Highlands AVA, but the wine shows similar power, with incredibly ripe, jammy yellow tropical fruit flavors accompanied by rich acidity. There's also a lot of new, smoky oak.",US
6652,US,"Despite the statewide appellation, this Chard tastes like it has a lot of cool-climate, coastal fruit in it. It's dry and crisply acidic, with bright flavors of limes, tangerines and pineapples.",US
6653,US,"There's a lot going on in this complex Chardonnay. The balance strikes you first, with crisp, zesty acidity cleansing the palate and preparing it for the onslaught of flavor. Then a tsunami of grilled pineapples, Meyer lemon pie filling, crème brûlée, butterscotch and vanilla hits. So devastatingly good, you can't keep your hands off it.",US
6654,US,"This is forward and a bit fat, with softly laid-in fruit flavors of pear, melon and white peach, set against generous, buttery oak. The 2005 seems to have had more acid and weight; this is a lighter, softer vintage, but the wine has been made in the same general style. It's ready to be enjoyed right now.",US
6655,US,"An easy-drinking, tasty Chardonnay at a pretty good price. Shows Central Coast acidity and bright flavors of limes, pineapples and pears, with a touch of sweet oak.",US
6656,US,"A good, dry Chardonnay that gets the job done at a fair price. Shows peaches and cream flavors with a bit of sharpness and green herbs on the finish.",US
6657,US,"In only the winery's second vintage, this Chard offers a balanced experience with notes of ripe red apple, pear and pineapple core playing harmoniously alongside soft toast and vanilla flavors. The full, creamy texture is stopped from being too much by moderate acidity and a clean finish.",US
6658,US,"A good Chardonnay, rich and creamy in pineapple, lime, Asian pear, vanilla and new oak flavors. It's balanced with crisp acidity. Drink now.",US
6659,US,"This is a very rich, oaky Chardonnay, ripe and forward in the California style. Although it's dry, it's so fruity and honeyed, it's almost like a dessert wine. Swamps the palate with pineapple jam, buttered toast and vanilla cream flavors, which are nicely balanced with crisp acidity.",US
6660,US,"This is from 30-year-old Wente clone vines, a crisply elegant, almost all stainless-fermented Chardonnay with a tight structure, underlying minerality and a zesty, lime-inflected flavor.",France
6661,US,"Very tightly wound in high acidity and even some tannins, with austere, aloof citrus flavors. There's not a lot of appeal to this wine now, except a certain dry, yeasty elegance. It's like a sparkling blanc de blancs without the bubbles.",US
6662,US,"Rich in oaky, fruity flavor, this wine satisfies with pineapples and other citrus fruits, buttered cinnamon toast and vanilla. It's pretty direct, but the price is right for a clean, crisp Chard made in the popular style.",US
6663,US,"Full-bodied and oaky, this Chard delivers an action-packed punch of flavor. The peaches, pears, pineapples, vanilla custard and smoky vanilla are so rich, they finish like honey. But the wine is actually dry.",US
6664,US,"Botrytis infected the grapes, but the winemaker has vinified this unique wine totally dry, so you get pure Chard and botrytis taste without the sweetness. Fascinates for the intense dried lime peel, yellow apricot, vanilla and honeyed flavors.",US
6665,US,"Over the years Mondavi's Reserve has taken a turn toward Chablis. Fans of lush, superripe Chards will find it tart, but it's really balanced and elegant. With a dry tang of minerals, it shows bright Meyer lemon, lime, pineapple and white peach flavors. One-third new oak adds creamy, smoky vanilla complexities. Should develop over the next six years.",US
6666,US,"All Milbrandt fruit has created a sappy, buttery and bright Washington Chardonnay. It bursts upon the palate with a beautiful mix of tropical fruits and caramel. Flavors are rich, persistent and lush. You want more long after the bottle has been drained.",US
6667,US,"Entirely barrel-fermented in older barrels, this wine nevertheless shows plenty of buttered toast aromas to go with its tropical fruit. It's broad in the mouth, medium-bodied and turns citrusy on the finish.",US

6669,US,"Rich, ripe and oaky, this pleasant Chard offers pineapple, kumquat, honeysuckle and buttered toast flavors, with bracing acidity.",US
6670,US,"Very crisp and slightly sweet, this simple, everyday Chardonnay has jammy flavors of pineapples, apples and lemon tarts. Pretty good for the price.",US
6671,US,"Made in the modern California Chardonnay style you'll either love or hate. It's enormously extracted in pineapple tart, crème brûlée and honey-drizzled buttered toast flavors, and the acidity is bright and clean. The superrichness would benefit from greater control.",US
6672,US,"Very rich, oaky and acidic, showing the crisp, minerally profile that usually marks white wines from this Monterey appellation. The flavors veer toward lemons, limes and Asian pears. Drink this drily elegant Chardonnay now.",US
6673,US,"Strong in flavor, showing the ripeness and crispness of all Bjornstad's Chardonnays, with lemondrop, lime tart, vanilla and buttered toast flavors. Very good, but doesn't quite have the elegance and refinement of the vineyard bottlings.",US
6674,US,"This rather old-fashioned (Wente clone) Chardonnay is full-flavored, with fruit front and center. Apples and pears are there in abundance, but the wine doesn't develop much layering.",US
6675,US,"Made in an exaggerated, oaky style that's dominated by caramel, butterscotch and vanilla flavors, with undertones of pineapple crème brûlée and ultra-ripe peaches.",US
6676,US,"At first high-toned, this opens nicely with crisp green apple fruit flavors. It's balanced and clear. Don't look for big, blowsy tropical flavors or buttery oak, though the barrel fermentation provides some texture to the finish. A great food wine.",US
6677,US,"A lush Chardonnay marked by the integrated balance of all its parts, resulting in great harmony. It's very ripe in tropical fruits and quite oaky and leesy, but like the powerful gymnasts at Cirque du Soleil, all the performers work together as a troupe. Drink with rich, fancy fare, like lobster or scallops.",US
6678,US,"Showing true cool-climate character, this Chard brims with tropical fruit, pear, honeysuckle and smoky oaky-vanilla flavors, with a gentle scour of acids. Pretty good price for a wine this rich.",US
6679,US,"A nicely balanced wine with ample fruit flavors of soft peach and honeydew backed by hints of soft sweet spice and toast. Lemon rind appears on the palate and finish, lifting the medium-weight mouth and providing a crisp, clean close.",US
6680,US,"Doesn't seem to have much, if any, oak on it, but it doesn't matter, because the underlying wine is so good, at such a nice price. Crisp and steely, it shows rich flavors of pineapples, apricots, tangerines and pears.",US
6681,US,"The underlying wine is very good, showing brisk acidity, a cool-climate minerality and long hangtime, ripe flavors of pineapples, crisp green apples, mangoes and limes. Yet the oak is heavy-handed, overwhelming the fruit with caramel, and making the finish too sweet.",US
6682,US,"Combines crisp, clean acidity, a bracing minerality and rich pineapple, peach and buttered toast flavors to produce a dry Chardonnay of great appeal. Defines the California style, in a classic, accessible way.",US
6683,US,"With no oak, there's nothing but bright, searing acidity and pure, intense flavors of limes and kiwis in this dry Chardonnay. There's an undertow of minerals, like the tang of cold steel. A very clean and pure expression of Edna Valley terroir.",US

6687,US,"Average- quality Chardonnay, with ripe tropical fruit and spice flavors, sound acidity and a pleasantly rich coat of smoky, buttery oak. Seems pricey.",US
6688,US,"A good, solid California Chardonnay at a fair price. It's creamy and crisp, with palate-satisfying flavors of pineapples, pears and green apples.",US
6689,US,"Very sweet, with honey-rich apricot, tangerine, vanilla cookie and crème brûlée flavors, this late-harvest Chard satisfies for sheer opulence. It has just enough acidity to balance all that sweetness.",US
6690,US,"This new vintage of Novelty Hill's estate Chardonnay shows more acid and spice than the slightly richer, creamier 2005, but offers the same superb winemaking. The fruit is a perfect mix of apple, pear, passion fruit and green banana, laced with cinnamon and sweet baking spices. This is that all-too-rare, affordably-priced domestic Chardonnay. It does not require food to “fill in” what's missing—nothing is missing!",US
6691,US,"A well-balanced barrel-fermented Chardonnay with harmonious notes of apple, toast and lemony citrus followed by a slightly nutty, vanilla-kissed finish. Moderate weight with a voluptuous mouth countered by vibrant acidity; easy to drink, just not very unique.",US
6692,US,"Shows the dryness, crisp acidity, flowers and minerality that often mark Carneros Chadonnays, which makes it elegant and sleek. With a touch of Meyer lemons and limes, it rises to richness.",US
6693,US,"A simple Chardonnay whose overdose of French oak does little to enhance the thin, reedy flavors of citrus fruits. The wine, which is nicely crisp and dry, would be better unoaked.",France
6694,US,"Dry and acidic, with very little fruit flavor, although it's clean and elegantly structured. Tastes like generically alcoholic white wine with a few drops of lemon and lime juice.",US

6702,US,"The wine is still showing a lot of rich new oak flavors: toast, coconut and vanilla crème. Sur lie aging (in 100% French oak) adds plenty of texture and the impression of minerality. Behind the oak is a lush mix of fruits, from tangerine and pineapple through papaya and ripe banana.",US

6706,US,"A well-balanced, partially oaked Chard with aromas of wood-grilled red apples, smoke and a hint of black licorice backed by flavors of toasted challah and tangerine citrus. Ample acidity keeps the palate and finish lively and clean.",US
6707,US,"Great price for a big production (5,000 cases) Chardonnay of this quality. It's dry and crisp and elegantly structured, with savory citrus fruit, peach, mineral and vanilla flavors. Easily as good as many Chards far more costly. From Don Sebastiani & Sons.",US
6708,US,"If there's any oak on this wine, it doesn't show. Instead, it brims with ripe, pure flavors of pineapples, kiwi fruit, limes and cinnamon spice. Crisp and bright.",US
6709,US,"Backward, with animal cracker notes and vanilla from oak treatment surrounding simple citrus flavors. Acidity is slightly rasping on the short, lemony finish. Try with grilled fish. Drink up.",US
6710,US,"A simple, sweet and lightly oaked Chardonnay, with flavors of buttered popcorn and sugary pineapple jam.",US
6711,US,"The word No refers to no oak and no malolactic fermentation. The wine is sharp in acids and totally dry, but with super-ripe flavors of pineapple, pear, peach and green apple marmalade. Very clean and mouth-cleansing.",US
6712,US,"New oak dominates the aromas and flavors, with buttered toast, buttered popcorn and caramel overwhelming the underlying fruit, which suggests pineapples and green apples. Although the wine is dry and acidity is fine, the fruit lacks the richness to support the oak.",US
6713,US,"Tastes a bit medicinal, with a sweet-sour quality of lemons and pineapples, and is quite acidic. Lacks richness, but it's a decent everyday Chardonnay.",US
6714,US,"Tart and jammy, with acidic, one-dimensional flavors of pineapples, vanilla and butterscotch.",US
6715,US,"A pretty good price for a single-vineyard Chard from a great appellation. Unoaked, the wine is very crisp in acidity, with citrus, apricot and mineral flavors that finish dry and clean.",US
6716,US,"A good wine that provides real Russian River Chardonnay character, at a decent price. Dry and crisp, it's made full Burgundy style, with vanilla and smoke accents to the pear, green apple and tropical fruit flavors.",US
6717,US,"Partially barrel fermented and aged on the lees, this Chard has a creamy texture, and good flavors of pears, pineapples, figs and vanilla. Brisk acidity makes the finish clean and tart.",US
6718,US,"This new release from Waterbrook is a slimmed down version of previous efforts, with rather plain fruit flavors and no discernible new oak influence. Not that that is necessarily a bad thing, but when Chardonnay is built upon little but simple green apple fruit flavors the grape's lack of character sometimes makes you wish for the return of the good old oaky days.",US
6719,US,"This is a fresh, vibrant stainless steel-fermented Chard that boasts charming notes of fresh apple slices, nectarine, lemon rind citrus and a hint of yellow florals. It's ripe and big without being too spicy or overdone, with a solid, lengthy finish. Drink now.",US
6720,US,This single-vineyard Chard with no oak has a light bouquet with nuances of white florals and red apple. The palate offers more heft and concentration with flavors of peach preserves and clementine supremes. Lower alcohol with a medium-length finish; rich and tasty without being overdone.,US
6721,US,"A well-made wine with a creamy texture and long finish, infused with aromas and flavors of buttered toast, grilled peaches, apple skins and almond shells. Balanced and not over-oaked; an excellent choice for hearty chicken pasta dishes and bisques.",US
6722,US,"Made in a food-friendly fashion, this Chard is dry, acidic and minerally. It was obviously picked at lower ripeness, but still shows a warm core of pineapples and green apples. Quite a nice wine for Chardonnay fans to drink with roasted chicken, fleshy fish, or even a white meat such as pork.",US
6723,US,"Oaky and ripe, this Chardonnay shows soft flavors of pineapples, Meyer lemons, mangoes and sweetly smoked vanilla oak. Made in the modern style for drinking now.",US
6724,US,"Crisp in acidity, with ripe flavors of pineapple jam, apricots and sweet spicy oak.",US
6725,US,"Made in the softly ripe, oaky style, this Chard shows flavors of pineapple cream, lemon zest, vanilla custard and cinnamon spice. It's a crowd pleaser.",US
6726,US,"Butter and cream are the dominant notes here and while the wine shows a nice kick of acidity and an opulent texture, there's not enough fruit on display. The finish turns a bit chemical.",US
6727,US,"The nose is candied, with aromas of pear drop, apple candy and kiwi that give way to melon in the mouth. Pleasant but dilute finish. No improvement with age.",US
6728,US,"A heavilyoaked style, with sawdust and vanilla extract aromas overlaying lemon and baking spices. The palate is a bit watery but nicely crisp and ends on a butter note. Drink up.",US
6729,US,"After some reduced sulfur scents blew off, creamy, buttery notes emerged, giving way to apple and vanilla in the mouth. The short finish turns slightly tart at the end. No improvement with age.",US
6730,US,"Sawdust scents dominate the nose while butter, underlined by candied orange peel and clove, take over in the mouth. Medium finish shows some funky notes.",US
6731,US,"A rich, fruity Chardonnay with lots of flavor and bright, mouthwatering acidity. Made sur lie, but with no oak, it has yeasty notes accenting pineapples, Asian pears, green apples, honeysuckle, cinnamon and vanilla.",US
6732,US,"Jammy and oaky, with simple, vanilla-infused flavors of pears, peaches, pineapples and vanilla cream.",US
6733,US,"Oaky influences give this wine a candied taste of caramel and lime pie, on top of the grapier flavors of pineapples and pears. It's solidly in the mode of what Americans want in a Chardonnay.",US
6734,US,"A bit common, with a scoury texture and decent flavors of pineapples, apples and oak, with a very dry, acidic finish.",US
6735,US,Quite big and decadent smelling as notes of caramel-drizzled apple pie with vanilla ice cream on top emanate from the glass. The mouth is full and milky with solid acidity supporting the rich flavors of toasted brioche and smoky apple. A solid choice for dishes that can match its intensity of flavors: think lobster newburg or crab thermidor.,US
6736,US,"A big, bold, bright and spicy Chardonnay. You'll hardly miss the presence of oak, it's so rich in fruit. Floods the mouth with oranges, pineapples, lemons, limes and minerals, with crisp acidity.",US
6737,US,"Lots of tropical fruit, orange, lime, pear and buttered popcorn flavors in this Chardonnay. It's very bright in acidity, and is almost honey-sweet on the finish.",US
6738,US,"Tart, with typical Chardonnay notes of melon and apple but also some odd banana scents that detract from the overall picture. The short finish lacks flavor. Drink up.",US
6739,US,"A hot, harsh and unbalance Chardonnay. Barely drinkable, except for some citrus and pear flavors.",US
6740,US,"Lime-peel acidity marks this bone-dry, tart wine. The other flavors include steely minerals, pineapple crème brûlée and buttered toast. Drink now.",US
6741,US,"The taste is dominated by sweet vanilla and caramelly oak. Buried under that are tropical fruit, pear and kiwi flavors. While the acidity is nice and crisp, the wine is too oaky.",US
6742,US,"Stunning and dramatic, reminiscent of a fine Burgundy. Hugely complex flavors of grilled tropical fruits, minerals, peaches and pears, elaborated with waves of smoky, honey-sweet oak and dusty spices. For all the richness, it's completely dry. A blend made from two of the greatest vineyards in the Russian River Valley.",US
6743,US,"Testarossa's 2007 Chardonnays are out, and this La Cruz is right up there with the best of them. Rich in citrusy acids, it dazzles the palate with Mandarin orange, pineapple-infused crème brûlée, mineral, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors. Drink this decadent wine soon.",US
6744,US,"Outstanding. Easily the best Signorello Chardonnay in many years, and a dramatic sign of the quality of the 2007 vintage. Shows intense tropical fruit, mineral and new oak aromas and flavors, with a rich array of dusty Asian spices. Just 72 cases were produced, but it's worth the search.",US
6745,US,"This is a pleasant, everyday sort of Chard, with broad fruit flavors suggesting melon, banana and light tropical. There's a substantial wash of vanilla cream, despite the stainless-steel aging, and the wine ebbs gracefully through a smooth, creamy finish.",US
6746,US,"Nice everyday wine, with pleasant peach, pineapple and pear flavors that finish with a touch of smoky oak and vanilla. It's easy to enjoy this one with ham, crab, corn on the cob or just by itself.",US
6747,US,"Fruity and oaky, with rich flavors of pineapples, pears, buttercream, vanilla cookie and toasty meringue. Crisp acidity provides clean balance.",US
6748,US,"The nose is lively and jumpy with notes of tart gooseberry, Granny Smith apple, lemony citrus and a hint of fresh ginger. The mouth offers riper, more oaky flavors of toasted nuts and pear flesh that lead through to the finish. Well balanced and easy to drink; so approachable, an excellent choice for outdoor summer dining with company.",US
6749,US,"This Chard offers a delicate but intricate bouquet with aromas of apple, vanilla spice and tropical acidity. The palate shows more floral and ripe red apple flavors, with a moderate weight in the mouth and a balanced finish. A solidly made and easy-to-enjoy wine.",US
6750,US,"A brisk, likeable Chardonnay. It shows ripe flavors of pineapples, peaches, lemons and sweet limes, accented with crisp coastal acidity. A hint of oak adds pleasant notes of buttered toast and vanilla.",US
6751,US,"Crisp and direct, showing bright, flamboyant pineapples, kiwis, figs, Meyer lemons and vanilla.",US
6752,US,"Sweetly ripe and oaky, with pineapple jam, kiwi, pear and green apple, and notes of vanilla, buttered popcorn and cream. Defines the fruit-forward, buttery style of Chardonnay in a soft, forward way.",US
6753,US,"So sweet and caramelized in smoky oak, it tastes almost like a dessert wine. There might even be some leftover sugar in the wine. Yet it has brisk, refreshing acidity, and there's no denying the deliciousness of the pineapple and lemon-pie flavors.",US
6754,US,"A sweet Chardonnay, made in the popular style. It's rich and creamy in vanilla and buttered toast, with fruity notes of pineapple and Key lime pie.",US
6755,US,"Light and toasty, this is a melon and citrus combo, with yeasty bread dough flavors showing its youth.",US
6756,US,"There's an herbal undertow to this wine, with suggestions of dill and sage to the pineapples, green apples and buttercream. It's also soft, lacking the clean vibrancy that a rich Chardonnay requires. Drink now.",US
6757,US,"How they manage to make dessert pastry flavors taste dry is a mystery. Whatever the answer is, this utterly delicious wine erupts with pineapple tart, date nut cookie, vanilla-covered orange and spicy mocha latté flavors, yet has no trace of residual sugar. Brilliant acidity makes it all clean and alive.",US
6758,US,"Actually from the Green Valley, a firm, young, minerally wine, with a flinty tang. There's also tremendous oak influence in the form of smoke, cream and butterscotch, but the richness comes from exotic Meyer lemon, Key lime pie and green apple jam fruit. Brilliant and compelling.",US
6759,US,"This Chardonnay is very fine, with a coat of smoky oak framing ripe flavors of apricots, oranges, fudgy vanilla custard and cinnamon spices. Balancing acidity is bright and keen. The wine should benefit from some time in the cellar, if you can keep your hands off it.",US
6760,US,"With 17% residual sugar, this supersweet wine seduces the palate with intense honey, but sweetness isn't enough. It falls short on the fruit side. If the apricot, peach and pineapple flavors were more intense, this would be a sensational wine.",US
6761,US,"Lees and new oak seem to prevail in this wine, giving it a yeasty, caramelized taste that overpowers the fruit, which seems just fine in pineapples, peaches and limes.",US
6762,US,"The vineyard is inland, in the Delta region, and the wine has exaggerated flavors of sweet, baked apricots, mangoes and pears, with charred barrel notes of clove and vanilla.",US
6763,US,"This unoaked Chard has a somewhat Chablilsienne quality to it, with a beautiful mineral-driven freshness supported by delicate aromas of white peach, green apple and lively orange citrus. Light and immensely refreshing, it's a perfect apértitif sipper to be enjoyed with cheese and crudité.",US
6764,US,"Nicely balanced with attractive aromas and flavors of ripe stone fruit, lightly charred red apple and limey citrus. The mouth is round and lush but not fat, with moderate acidity keeping the weight in check and leading the way through the medium-length finish. Great for company alongside goat cheese appetizers.",US
6765,US,"Sweeter smelling than the usual Chard, with peach preserves, lychee, pear and pink florals unfolding in the bouquet. The mouth offers more oak-driven balance, with notes of cedar plank and spiced pears filling the cream-textured mouth. Seals the deal with a lingering, toasty finish.",US
6766,US,"Oak sticks out on this Chardonnay, striking with buttered toast, vanilla and wood char notes that dominate the underlying wine, which has perfectly fine citrus and tropical fruit flavors.",US
6767,US,"Sweeter, more developed aromas of caramel, candied red apple, Boston baked beans and honeydew develop on the nose, while the mouth shows more typical Chard notes of baked apple and hazelnut butter. A touch round and flabby, but ends with a long, delicious, vanilla-kissed finish.",US
6768,US,"Made in the modern style of oaky softness and jammy ripe fruit. Shows appealing pineapple, pear, buttered toast and vanilla cream flavors, with just enough acidity for balance.",US
6769,US,"Offers plenty of decadent richness, with elaborately smoked oak framing ripe, rich flavors of pineapples, limes, kiwi fruit and honeysuckle. Superb acidity provides crispness for balance. A yummy, impeccably crafted Central Coast Chardonnay.",US
6770,US,"Too sweet, with jellied peach, pineapple and apricot flavors. Without the sugary taste this would be a really good Chard.",US
6771,US,"Generic Chardonnay, almost invisible, with some suggestions of soap and flowers and a bit of heat in the finish.",US
6772,US,"There's some bitterness along the edges of this wine; the tart, light fruit flavors are outlined in bitter phenolics that detract from the overall mouthfeel. Green apple and plenty of acid is the story here.",US
6773,US,"Oaky and ripe, this Chardonnay shows barrel-inspired vanilla and buttered toast flavors that enrich the pineapples and apples. A touch of Gewurztraminer lifts it into floral and lychee territory.",US
6774,US,"Made in the California style, with very ripe pineapple and apple fruit, elaborated by French oak barrels, malolactic fermentation and sur lie aging. The result will appeal to many, even if it's a bit obvious and direct.",US
6775,US,"Tastes too oaky, with overwhelming smoky caramel, vanilla extract and buttered toast notes that swamp the underlying pineapples and peaches. In this case, you're better off with Gainey's regular 2007 Chard, which costs a lot less.",US
6776,US,"Year in and year out, Mer Soleil's Chardonnay is one of the biggest, most distinctive ones in California. The '06 is almost like a late-harvest dessert wine, rich in apricot jam, pineapple custard and new oak butterscotch flavors, but for all the opulence, it's entirely dry, and has zesty Monterey acidity. Almost a food group in itself, it will challenge chefs to rise to the occasion.",US
6777,US,"The winery's '05 reserve is oakier than their regular Chard, and the wine is heavier and less fresh, an impression heightened by full malolactic fermentation, which has softened the acidity and given a buttery taste.",US
6778,US,"Dainty and nuanced with notes of honeydew melon and red apple skin in the bouquet followed by flavors of stone fruit and peach. Moderate weight and acidity, with vibrant citrus carrying the refreshing finish.",US
6779,US,"With 12 months in French oak, the Reserve Barrel Fermented Chardonnay is a rounder, more spice-infused Chard than Macari's regular Estate Bottled offering. As big as it is, the nose is somewhat muted with soft notes of pear and yellow flowers and the palate shows more as a result of the oak (spice, toast) than the fruit.",US
6780,US,"Rich flavors of peaches, pears, buttercream and toast appear in this dry Chardonnay, which shows no signs of tiredness, although many 2007s do. The chief problem is excessive softness. It lacks balancing acidity and brightness.",US
6781,US,"Direct, with smoky oak-infused flavors of ultra-ripe pineapples, oranges, pears and honeysuckle. Very bright acidity makes it mouthwatering.",US
6782,US,"Way too sweet for balance, this wine has the benefit of crisp acidity, but the sugary raspberry jelly taste prevails.",France
6783,US,"No oak lets the basic wine show through, but the problem is that it's unbalanced. It's sugary sweet in peach and apricot flavors, with a harsh, burnt finish.",US
6784,US,"This bright gold Chardonnay is a bit heavy-handed. The oak really clobbers with lumbery, woody tannins. Somewhere in here there is pineapple and citrus fruit, but it gets buried.",US
6785,US,"The delicate nose on this reserve Chard offers citrus and flowers with a touch of nutty spice. On the palate, it's a straightforward white with elements of lemon citrus, grapefruit and hazelnut. An easy-drinking Chardonnay with class.",US
6786,US,"Oaky, fat and slightly sweet, with creamy flavors of pineapples, buttered popcorn and vanilla. A good approximation of a Burgundian-style California Chardonnay at a fair price.",US
6787,US,"The influence of sur lie aging marks this wine, with an almost Champagne-like yeastiness. It's also quite oaky. That combo of dough and caramel tends to mask the pineapple jam and lemon custard flavors. Should develop through 2010. Don't drink too cold.",US
6788,US,"Grown in a famous cool-climate vineyard, this Chardonnay is vastly rich in grilled pineapple, orange cream, apricot jam, mineral and vanilla honey flavors that taste like they have a touch of botrytis. It will slowly evolve over the next six years.",US
6789,US,"This is a massive, powerful Chardonnay, a New World style that's superripe and heavily oaked. You either like it or you don't. Aficionados of this approach will love the opulence of the honey, pineapple jam, apricot, crème brûlée, vanilla and buttercream flavors. Calls for very rich dishes, like lobster.",US
6790,US,"This multicounty blend is very ripe in peach, pineapple, apricot, green apple and vanilla oak flavors. It has a crispness that helps to balance the fruit, and finishes honeyed and spicy.",US
6791,US,"Burgundian technique was used in this wine, and the aromas and tastes of those techniques dominate. The wine is heavy in leesy, yeasty, toasted oak notes, which dominate, rather than subtlely support, the underlying fruit.",US
6792,US,"Simple and easy, with oaky flavors of apricots, peaches and pineapples in a creamy texture. Fine for picnics and parties.",US
6793,US,"Not very subtle, but oaky and ripe, with strong flavors of pineapple jam, pear, vanilla and toasty oak. Made in the popular style, at a decent price.",US
6794,US,"A medium bouquet of apple, lemon and a touch of fresh young peach. The oak is there but not overpowering. The palate is well structured with good acidity and a medium weight followed by a lengthy finish.",US
6795,US,"A little harsh and rugged around the edges, but shows good Chardonnay character. Peaches and cream, pineapple fruit and buttered toast flavors lead to a clean finish.",US
6796,US,"A simple, soft, oaky Chardonnay made in the modern style. Tastes sugary sweet in apricot, pineapple and peach jam flavors.",US
6797,US,"A good, rich Chardonnay that satisfies fans of oaky, ripe bottlings. Brims with pineapple, peach, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors, brightened with crisp acidity.",US
6798,US,"Bone dry and hard in acidity, this is an austere Chardonnay that lacks richness, and hopes to trade on elegance. It has modest pineapple flavors, touched with smoky oak and lees. Defines a low-alcohol, minerally approach. Drink now.",US
6799,US,"Few wineries in California can craft a Chard as rich, balanced and ageworthy as this. In its youth this ‘05 is flashy in lemondrop, pear and spicy anise, with a honeyed finish and crisp acidity. It's quite addictively brilliant, a wine whose lush harmony mesmerizes the palate. But Hanzell Chards invariably age well, and this is a wine you can dependably put into your cellar for 5, 10, 15 years, even longer, as it continues to evolve and become more limpid and minerally.",US
6800,US,"This herbal, crisp Chardonnay is clean and bracing. The winery name suggests the flavors, which have a thistly component, along with tangerine, Meyer lemon, lime, green apple and tonic. Very long and very fresh.",US
6801,US,"This Columbia Gorge winery is knocking it out of the park with its Chardonnays. This estate reserve is tangy and tart, a luscious mix of apple, pear and melon. It seems to gain power and concentration in the mouth, buoyed by perfect acidity.",US
6802,US,"A good everyday Chardonnay that shows crisp acidity and the ultra-dryness and cleanliness of a well-made Central Coast Chard. Made for drinking now, with lime, white peach and mineral flavors.",US
6803,US,"This is a regional wine, but don't dismiss it because it doesn't have a vineyard designation. It shows the vibrant acidity of the Highlands, and the long, cool vintage has given exceptionally ripe flavors of pineapples, guavas and passionfruit. Your guests will love it.",US
6804,US,"This Chardonnay has depth, starting with its unfolding nose of ripe Chardonnay fruit, minerals, hazelnut and citrus. The palate offers flavors of pear, citrus and grapefruit, its character refreshing and fruity but somewhat complex. An impressive white that can handle richer dishes.",France
6805,US,"Brisk and sprightly, with keen acidity that makes the mouth water. The basic flavors suggest ripe Meyer lemons, pineapples, Key lime pie, spicy Asian pear, vanilla and honeysuckle. A good, rich crowd pleaser at an affordable price.",US
6806,US,"Crisply acidic and very dry, with modest pineapple, lime and mineral flavors and a touch of leesy sourness wrapped into a cream mouthfeel. Drink now.",US
6807,US,"A little on the sweet, jammy side, but shows plenty of Chard character, with a rich vein of creamy, smoky oak. Peaches, pears, pineapples and green apples are the flavors.",US
6808,US,"A little rough around the edges, with a sweet, sugar-cured tobacco note to the tropical fruit, peach and pear flavors. But this is a good price for an everyday Chard with true varietal character.",US
6809,US,"There's too much oak interfering with this Chardonnay, which was grown just below the Santa Lucia Highlands. The underlying fruit is fine, suggesting crisply ripe nectarines and pears, but the oak buries it under a plaster of smoky caramel and butterscotch.",US
6810,US,"If you like 'em big and oaky, then this one's for you. Aromas and flavors of wood-grilled peaches, roasted red apples, buttery toast and rich nuttiness all generously abound. The mouth is full and slightly fat, with moderate acidity and a medium-length, smoky finish.",US
6811,US,"A little heavy and dense in oak and lees, which tamp down the fruit and give the wine a certain flatness. Nonetheless you'll find grace notes of pineapples, apricots and minerals.",US
6812,US,"Tries for Burgundian richness, but ends up rather common, although it will satisfy fans of buttery, oaky Chardonnays. Shows ripe flavors of pineapple jam, apricot purée and buttered popcorn.",US
6813,US,"There have been Estate Selection Chards from Cuvaison before, but never a block bottling. This wine fully merits its status and price. Tightly angular and acidic in youth, it's very minerally, with a gunmetal tang to the oak-infused Meyer lemon, green apple and green pear flavors. One of the rare California Chardonnays not ready on release, this Chablis-style wine will be best in mid-2008, and should develop for another few years.",US
6814,US,"Ripe and juicy, with pineapple, pear, apricot, vanilla and buttered toast flavors. This is a nice everyday Chardonnay. From Talley.",US
6815,US,"The aroma suggests a ton of oak, and that impression carries over to the flavors. Butterscotch, buttered toast, caramel, crème brûlée, they're all tasty, but you don't want them to dominate, and here, they do. The underlying flavors of pineapples are swamped.",US
6816,US,"Strong in fruit and oak, but very rich and elegant. Shows massively ripe flavors of green apples, pears and pineapples, with a honeysuckle floral note and leesy, oaky influences. Dry and crisp, it's an upscale Chardonnay to drink with the classic San Francisco combo of crab and buttered sourdough bread.",US
6817,US,"A mix of vineyard sites contribute to this juicy Chardonnay, with a luscious core of apple, melon and lime. Mostly stainless steel fermented, but about 15% was placed in neutral barrels to add textural richness. No malolactic fermentation took place, keeping the acids fresh and juicy.",France
6818,US,"This is an intense wine, and a very young one. It's tight and minerally, with stone, lees, citrus and sweet oak flavors that leave behind the impression of austerity. You could enjoy it now, but don't serve too cold, and it will improve and become more complex with up to six years in the bottle.",US
6819,US,"Tasty and rich, this unoaked Chardonnay is very ripe and crisp, with vanilla and honey touches to the candied lemondrop, pineapple and honeysuckle flavors. Drink now.",US
6820,US,"Rich and soft, this Chard has strong flavors of stewed apricots, peaches, pineapples and vanilla. It would benefit from more crispness.",US
6821,US,"Here's a wine in a box that shows nice Chardonnay character. It has peach, pear and apple flavors, with crisp acidity that makes it clean and vibrant. Some boxed wines are hard to open, but this one has an easy screwcap.",US
6822,US,"Very ripe, almost jammy in apricots, pineapples and pears, this Chard seems sweet, like sugared or honeyed pie-filling. The finish is a bit cloying.",US
6823,US,"Tastes like fruity soda pop or canned fruit syrup, with sugary pineapple and pear flavors. The oak is unnaturally sweet and strong.",US
6824,US,"Barrel fermented and aged in American oak for 15 months, this is a big and powerfully oaky Chard with dominating notes of butter, wood-infused stone fruit and apple pie along with a hint of grapefruit oil in the mouth. The finish is toasty  with a lingering vanilla bean note.",US
6825,US,"Aged 14 months in Russian Oak, this is a different kind of Chard with notes of chamomile, fresh mint sprigs, vanilla and cigar tobacco among the more typical melon fruits and lime citrus. Medium-full but a bit flat in the mouth with a solid but quite smoky finish.",US
6826,US,"A little dainty on aromas with hints of nectarine, honeysuckle and licorice. The mouth is ripe and rich with notes of roasted red apple, orangey citrus and a touch of mealy stone fruit. You get a bit of heat on the finish that fades fast and leaves the other fruit flavors lingering.",US
6827,US,"Here's one of those rare California Chards that needs time. The wine is tight, tough and minerally in its youth, with an austerity of flavors suggesting Meyer lemons, nectarines and flint. Bone dry and crisp, it should blossom between 2008 and 2015, with proper cellaring.",US
6828,US,"The very fine Allen Vineyard, on Westside Road in the tenderloin of the appellation, has produced a high-quality Chardonnay that is capable of some bottle aging. Dry and savory, it shows a strong mineral component to the pie filling limes, lemondrop, apple, fig and roasted hazelnut flavors. Should develop before fading, over the next 5 years.",US
6829,US,"A generous Chardonnay whose spicy taste leads to a crisp, dry finish. The wine is wonderfully ripe, showing pineapple, golden kiwi, Key lime pie and oaky vanilla flavors.",US
6830,US,"Good everyday value in a Chardonnay. Shows a wealth of buttered toast, pineapple, lemondrop and cinnamon flavors, in a creamy texture.",US
6831,US,"Rich and oaky, this Chard has flavors of vanilla custard, caramel, butterscotch, pineapple jam, Meyer lemons and pear tart with the crust. It's a crowd-pleaser that will appeal to legions of Chardonnay lovers.",US
6832,US,"This is a good, dry and racy Chardonnay. It's not rich or particularly fruity, but it is elegant, with mineral-infused suggestions of citrus fruits brightened with a bite of acidity.",France
6833,US,"New toasty oak currently dominates, offering the butterscotch, buttered toast and caramel flavors that so many people think is the taste of Chardonnay, but is not. The true fruit stands out as pineapples and pears. It's a very clean, hedonistic wine to drink now with rich fare, like shellfish.",US
6834,US,"This is Cohn's reserve-style Chardonnay and it's easily their best since the 1990s. Made from two vineyards in the cool Carneros district of Sonoma, it's ripe in pineapple and green apple flavors enhanced with the toast of oak, the creaminess of lees and the buttery softness of malolactic fermentation. Easy to drink with opulent fare such as crab.",US
6835,US,"This is a very rich Chardonnay marked by creamy, leesy, butter and oak notes that give it an exotic sweetness. But it's bone-dry, and the underlying fruit is powerful enough to stand up to all that bling. Just delicious in pineapple, pear marmalade, crème brûlée and spice flavors.",US
6836,US,"Always a joy to drink, the latest vintage of DDO's Arthur combines richness and elegance in a seamless and fascinating whole. Cucumber and melon, apple and pear fruit is the base, which expands into wet stone and mineral, then butter cookie. It's a one-wine seminar in how to make great Chardonnay, expressing the acid-driven elegance of Burgundy with some of the lushness of New World grapes. Tasted even better on the second day.",US
6837,US,"This refreshing Chardonnay entices with aromas of tropical fruit, citrus and fresh white flowers. The crisp style smacks of grapefruit and lemon, but it's well rounded. Food-friendly, the wine will pair well with seafood, chicken and spicy cuisine.",US
6838,US,"The wine's barrel aging comes through immediately, with its toasted nut and vanilla nose. On the palate, the wine is balanced—with its citrus fruit, spice and touch of flowers. Elegant and easy to love—a good use of oak.",US

6841,US,Simple and sweet. Tastes like lemonade.,US
6842,US,"Hat Trick is the best of the best of Morgan's estate vineyard, which is in the chilliest northwestern part of the Highlands. Acidity stars, giving the wine a brilliant crispness that's so clean and fine. Barrel fermented in one-third new French oak, the wine is incredibly rich and leesy. The terroir has coaxed out complex layers of pineapples, Meyer lemons, limes, apricots and very exotic tropical fruits suggesting golden mangoes and papayas. The oak adds even richer layers of crème brûlée to this vastly enjoyable wine.",US
6843,US,"Though there's no oak on this Chard, it's still quite rich and ripe with loads of honeydew, yellow peach slices, lightly baked apple and tangerine oil. The mouth is round and lacking a bit more acidity, but as a whole the wine is enjoyable and easy to drink.",US
6844,US,"Fresh and fruity with dominating notes of green apple, young white peach, chamomile and sweet grass. Lime citrus appears in the mouth and on the finish, livening up the moderate weight and medium-length finish.",US
6845,US,"Simple and honey sweet, with pineapple and buttered toast flavors. Gets the job done.",US
6846,US,"Too sweet, with jammy pineapple and oak flavors. Crisp acidity and some minerality help to restore balance, but  the sugary taste is off-putting.",US
6847,US,"There's a good wine in here, but it's buried under so much oak, it's hard to taste it. The flavors of caramel and butterscotch swamp the underlying pineapples. Oakophiles will love it.",US
6848,US,"Shows the bright, tart acidity of this fine coastal region, with signature flavors of pineapples, figs, dates, limes and vanilla. But finishes too sweet in white sugar to earn a higher score.",US
6849,US,"Dry, acidic and earthy, lacking the richness you want in a fine Chardonnay. Could almost be a Pinot Grigio, with its crisp citrus and mineral flavors.",US
6850,US,"Lots of rich pineapple, buttered toast, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors in this Chard. It's made in an uncomplicated style to appeal to consumers who have made this kind of Chardonnay the most popular wine in America.",US
6851,US,"Buttered toast and caramel corn dominate this Chardonnay, which also features ripe pineapple and golden mango flavors. It's made in the popular style of ripe, oaky fruitiness.",US
6852,US,"Tropical fruits, flowers and citrus lead this appetizing Chardonnay from Peconic. On the palate, the wine has some depth, with lemon/grapefruit citrus, pear and apple. A good everyday white.",US
6853,US,"Sharp in texture and medicinally sweet, this Chard comes primarily from warm inland sections of Mendocino. It has LifeSaver pineapple candy and peach   flavors.",US
6854,US,"Too oaky for true balance, this Chard shows intrusive sweet vanilla, char and crème brûlée flavors that overpower the fundamental fruit. Makes you wonder why they put so much oak on it, because the underlying wine has nice pineapple and pear flavors.",US
6855,US,"Sugary sweet and simple, with candied, jellied flavors of peaches and oranges.",US
6856,US,"Starts a bit chemically, but that blows off to reveal minor fruit notes of red apple flesh and mushy melon. Light and prickly in the mouth with a medium-length finish. Growing a little tired; drink now.",US
6857,US,"Made in the popular style, with rich, ripe pineapple jam and kiwi fruit flavors enhanced with the sweet vanillins of oak. A good Chardonnay at a fair price.",US
6858,US,"A touch on the delicate side with very soft aromas of white peach, melon and barely browned toast. The palate is light but round with ample flavors of apple core, hard nectarine and citrus rind. Fulfilling and enjoyable without being overdone; pair with chicken or crab salads.",US
6859,US,"Those familiar with Morgan's more expensive Chardonnays, such as the Double L (which comprises 55% of this blend) will find true value in this regional wine. It shows similar power and authority in a showy, Chablis-style wine whose acidic, minerally structure frames intense citrus and oak flavors.",US
6860,US,"Simple and direct, with oaky flavors of pineapples, apricots and tropical fruits. Finishes slightly sweet.",US
6861,US,"Somewhat simple and oaky, this Chard has green apple, pineapple cookie, buttered popcorn and vanilla flavors. It's a pretty wine made for drinking now.",US
6862,US,"A lovely counterpoint to Phelps Creek's estate reserve Chardonnay, this comes from just across the river, sourced from a vineyard on the Washington side of this two-state AVA. It got the full malolactic, fermented in French oak treatment, and shows plenty of pleasing barrel toast and spice. The fruit mixes hints of peach and melon with a lemon drop core, and finishes with a lick of butterscotch.",US
6863,US,"For those who want some buttered popcorn flavors in their Chardonnay, this nails it. Thick and toasty, yet buttressed with full-on fruit flavors of melon, peach, lemon and lime, it's forward and appealing. Not for cellaring—this one's for gulping.",US
6864,US,"Thick and substantial, this is a full-bodied, almost meaty Chardonnay with a mix of citrus and stone fruits. It was barrel-fermented, and is graced with flavors of toasted cracker. What it lacks in finesse it makes up for in heft.",US
6865,US,"Sweet, fruity and oaky, this Chard has flavors of peaches, pineapples and smoky vanilla.",US
6866,US,"A little on the thin side, fruit-wise. Shows modest peach and pear flavors, with lots of caramelly, toasty oak.",US
6867,US,"Tastes way too oaky, with a plaster of sweet vanilla and caramelized charcoal. The underlying pineapple fruit just isn't strong enough to support all that wood.",US
6868,US,"An unoaked Chard that's more than a little sweet. Tastes like a spicy mix of apricot, peach and orange jam.",US
6869,US,"Sweet and medicinal, with candied apricot and honey flavors balanced with crisp acidity.",France
6870,US,"Far too much sugary sweetness mars this Chardonnay. The peach, pear and tropical fruit flavors are well-oaked, adding caramel candy to the jelly flavors.",US
6871,US,"Nice and oaky and rich, from a vineyard in the heart of the cool-climate southern part of Russian River Valley. Acidity stars, giving zesty balance to the ripe pineapple, green apple, Key lime pie and pear flavors. New oak, to the tune of 40%, adds an opulent touch.",US
6872,US,"Rich and appealing, a new bottling from the winery. All the parts have yet to knit together, but they're all good, and the wine should drink well by winter 2007. New oak frames tart green apple, pineapple, kumquat and cinnamon spice flavors that are heightened by bright, zesty acidity.",US
6873,US,"After variable experience with Chardonnay, Peju is getting a grip. This wine, with nearly two-thirds new French oak, is fruity and crisp, with smooth, long pineapple and peaches and cream flavors.",US
6874,US,"This bottling of Chardonnay, from one of the best white wine sites in Monterey, has kept its quality as well as its price over the years. Dry and zesty in acidity, it has a firm, stony minerality that underlies the apricot, white peach and grapefruit juice flavors. Shows real elegance, at a fair price.",France
6875,US,"With a little neutral oak to give a touch of smoky cream, this everyday wine has good apple and peach fruit, and a nice clean cut of acidity.",US
6876,US,"Riding the unoaked Chardonnay train is Daniel Gehrs, not really known for this variety. The wine is brisk, fruity and clean, bursting with tropical fruit and spice flavors and finishing long and clean.",US
6877,US,"Ordinary and one-dimensional. The grapes got superripe under the California sun, offering big flavors of pineapples and peaches, liberally accented with oak. But there's not much going on below the surface.",US
6878,US,"There's not a whole lot going on in this Chard, with muted aromas of overripe peach and hints of mealy pear in the mouth. A touch flabby but the finish is clean and the balance solid. The label peels off like a sticker for easy record keeping.",US
6879,US,"The aromas of this wine are a touch honeyed with notes of baked apple and sweet smoke. The finish is medium length, but the alcohol comes through a bit too aggresively.",US
6880,US,"There's something Chablisian about this Chardonnay. It's partly the acidity, which is high, and partly the gunmetal minerality, courtesy of another cool vintage in the southern Napa/Carneros region where the grapes were grown. Add in oak-infused pineapples, peaches and pears, and you have a fairly significant wine that could even benefit from some years in the cellar.",US
6881,US,"Dry and fashionable, this has a dusty, minerally character and high acidity that's reminiscent of a good Chablis. The cool, long vintage resulted in subtle peach, pear, pineapple and spice flavors.",US
6882,US,"Ripeness was not a problem with this wine, which is fat and unctuous. It shows complex apricot, mineral, pear, green apple and lees flavors that finish with a glyceriney taste of honey. Should develop for a few years in the bottle.",US
6883,US,"A fruity, direct Chardonnay that will appeal to fans for its peach, pear and oak flavors. Not especially complicated, but a fine example of the variety at a good price.",US
6884,US,"The hot climate of the Cold Creek Vineyard sharpens up the contours of this Chardonnay, which shows more of a classic Washington character. Bright fruit, a mix of apples and peaches and pears, is shot through with streaks of butterscotch from fermentation in new French oak. It's been through 100% malolactic, yet retains some crispness. Polished and full-bodied.",US
6885,US,"Shows classic Santa Rita Hills cool-climate Chard notes of very high acidity and Meyer lemon drop flavors, but both may be too much of a good thing. So sharp, so citrusy, the palate craves something softer, creamier, and richer in fruit. Maybe it was a victim of the chilly vintage in a cool area.",US
6886,US,"Good value from this dependable nègociant. It shows typical Edna Valley acidity, like the fresh juice from a ripe lime. The flavors veer toward limes, clover honey and vanilla, although the finish is dry and clean.",US
6887,US,"Like a fruit basket in a glass, this easy-drinking Chard explodes with orange popsicle, pineapple jam, lemon meringue pie, peach custard and vanilla aromas and flavors. It's creamy-smooth and a little sweet.",US
6888,US,"Lots of oak on this dry wine, which is clean despite its age. Crisp acidity frames tropical fruit flavors, wrapped into a creamy texture. Drink now.",US
6889,US,"There's a firm minerality and an acidic mouthfeel to this that suggests some cellaring. The oak dominates, all smoky vanillins and wood-sweet, but the underlying fruit is enormously ripe. Give it a year or so to knit together.",US
6890,US,"Oaky and ripe, with powerful tropical pineapple, kumquat, mineral and floral aromas and flavors. New oak adds smoke, vanilla and char. The bottom line is of a flavorful, acidic and elegant Chard with a lingering, spicy finish.",US
6891,US,"A crisp, fresh, medium-bodied Chardonnay, this is toasty and nutty but not overly vanilla-scented. Grilled peach and buttered sweet corn notes pick up citrus overtones that finish long and mouthwatering.",US
6892,US,"Too sweet, almost like a dessert wine, this Chard has sugary flavors of pineapple custard, with caramelized wood vanillins. Could use greater balance and subtlety.",US
6893,US,"A decent price for an everyday Chardonnay that gives people what they like in this variety. It's rich in pineapple jam, pear and honey flavors, with an elaborate coating of sweet oak.",US
6894,US,"Simple and sweet, like a fruit juice blend of apples, peaches and pineapples you buy in the supermarket.",US
6895,US,"Though a bit lead-footed, this Chard throws up some nice cream, honey and clove aromas. While the palate is swamped with vanilla, nice baked apple flavors come through on the finish before fading to a popcorn note.",US
6896,US,"INOX—from the French inoxidable—is Chehalem's stainless steel fermented and aged take on Chardonnay. It is consistently their best effort, with bright, acid-driven fruit that is a complex blend of pineapple, green apple, golden apple and Asian pear. It doesn't try to be more than it is, and it has a wonderfully persistent finish.",US
6897,US,"Smooth, crisply acidic and bone dry, this Chard shows an austere minerality and streamlined texture that makes it very food-friendly. It's packed with Meyer lemon, yellow apricot and fig flavors that finish long and spicy. Really nice, and shows the promise of Lake County for Chardonnay.",US
6898,US,"Crisp and fine in coastal acidity, with bright flavors of pineapples, ripe pears and green apples, this would be a good Chardonnay, except for one thing. It's too sweet.",US
6899,US,"Pale and watery, with bare hints of lemon, pineapple and unripe melon. There's not much here except lemony water.",US
6900,US,"A little dark, heavy and sweet, not to mention prematurely old. The pineapple fruit is aging already, and there's a vegetal edge.",US
6901,US,"Oaky and strong in jammy fruit, this Chardonnay has potent pineapple, tropical fruit and buttered caramel popcorn flavors. It's also quite acidic. Would benefit from greater control and nuance.",US
6902,US,"There's a fruit juice quality to this Chard, like an apricot, peach and pineapple blend you buy in the supermarket. It has refreshing acidity and a clean finish.",US
6903,US,"Shafer's '05 is drier, crisper and more minerally than its predecessors from warmer vintages. You might even call it leaner. But it still shows the elegant balance that always characterizes the wine, with brilliant acidity.",France
6904,US,"Franciscan helped pioneer the use of wild or indigenous yeasts years ago, hence the name, and whether that technique makes better wines is debatable. Still, the level of Cuvée Sauvage has been generally high. The '05 reflects the cool balance of the vintage, with ripe peach, pear, mango and oaky-butterscotch flavors accompanied by crisp balancing acidity.",US
6905,US,"Half the fruit is sourced from the Carabella vineyard, half from the Hyland vineyard. This is a young, tense, tight wine, still melding itself together. Melon, green pineapple, green banana and Streaks of butter and toast suggest that all the right flavor components are in place. The wine remains steely and compressed; definitely a white wine that should be decanted.",US
6906,US,"This is a barrel selection from the winery's Sleepy Hollow Vineyard and is one of the most concentrated Chardonnays in California. Has the honeyed richness of a botrytized wine, but is absolutely dry. Tastes like an apricot and pineapple tart, with seasonings of nutmeg, cinnamon, and the smoky, nutty pie crust. Very few California Chardonnays need time, but this one does. Stash until late 2008, but this powerhouse should gradually peak over a decade.",US
6907,US,"Superripe in fruit and superoaky, this is a big, lush, powerful Chardonnay, but for all the size, it maintains balance and elegance. Potent in smoky, vanilla-accented pineapple brûlée, exotic date and stony mineral flavors, it shows the crisp acidity the vineyard is known for, and finishes dry and spicy.",US
6908,US,"Couldn't be riper or more powerful in flavor, a Chard that just detonates with explosive pineapple tart filling, honey, vanilla and crème brûlée. Could use a bit of subtlety, but fans of pure Chardonnay flavor will be delighted.",US
6909,US,"Here's an easy-drinking Chard that provides notes of pear, melon and small white flowers. The acidity is vibrant in the mouth, but the finish falls a bit flat in the end.",US
6910,US,"Shows the richness and complexity of all Testarossa's Chardonnays, with masses of tropical fruit and oak flavors balanced by zesty acidity. But this wine, with a statewide appellation, has a mouthwatering minerality, a zesty tang of steel, that gives the wine extra layers. What a delicious, exciting Chardonnay.",US
6911,US,"This hugely ripe Chardonnay is just a little too big for absolute balance. Any more powerful, and it would be over the line. As it is, it flirts with it, with gobs of jammy apricots, yellow pears, citrine and Meyer lemondrop, as well as barrel influences ranging from creamy lees to buttered toast, roasted hazelnuts and smoky honey. The alcohol is over 15%.",US
6912,US,"Passes muster for its tropical fruit and vanilla cream flavors. Turns a little cloying and sweet on the finish, though.",US
6913,US,"This is a very rich, with quite ripe, banana and tropical fruits. Barrel fermentation brings more richness to the palate: buttered nuts, caramel and crème brûlée. For its over-the-top style, it's been done very well, but it tires the palate rather quickly.",US
6914,US,"Super-rich, a fat, opulent Chard that tastes almost as sweet as a dessert, except it's dry. Shows massive flavors of Meyer lemon custard, minerals, pear tart, buttered toast, butterscotch, smoky pie crust and honey, with a sprinkle of cinnamon and nutmeg. Lush and gorgeous.",US
6915,US,"A spectacular Chardonnay grown in Failla's estate vineyard, high in the mountains above the Sonoma Coast, and open to the Pacific's cool winds. The pineapple custard, tangerine, lemon tart and mineral flavors are compellingly delicious, while crisp coastal acidity adds a refreshingly clean tang. This is a grand cru wine.",US
6916,US,"A big, bold, exuberantly rich wine, classic Williams Selyem Chard. The underlying wine is all pineapples, peaches, pears and exotic tropical fruits, while oak adds elaborate layers of buttered toast, caramel, nougat and vanilla. Acidity is high, which will help the wine age through 2013.",US
6917,US,"A worthy followup to the '05, possibly even richer and more balanced. Shows wonderfully crisp, mouthwatering acidity framing fruit that's so pure, it's like the essence of pineapples, mangoes, limes and green apples. Lots of oak is here, too, and the smoky, spicy vanillins add just the right touch.",US
6918,US,"Nutty and melon-scented, this is a medium-bodied Chardonnay with distinct tangerine and spice components Lohr attributes to the “Muscat clone” used in this wine. Finishes with a flourish of buttery richness. This would pair beautifully with cold crab.",US
6919,US,"Super-ripe, superoaky, and while these are potential pitfalls, Testarossa handles them with aplomb. The flavors really impress, offering a detonation of creamy, smoky oak and imposingly rich pineapple custard and crème brûlée. It's all balanced by zesty acidity. Drink this flashy Chardonnay now.",US
6920,US,"This is a new winery for me, and it's produced quite an impressive wine. It's big, thick, mouth-filling, with creamy pineapple custard and spice flavors and a firm, acidic minerality that is clearly a function of terroir. Impresses not only for power but finesse.",US
6921,US,"There aren't a lot of wines coming off this appellation, and most of them are red. But this is a wonderful Chard. Ripe and detailed, it combines tropical fruit, mineral and oak flavors, and is dry and tart in acids. This is one of the few California Chardonnays I would age for up to ten years.",US
6922,US,"The vineyard is in the Green Valley, and the acidity is very high, giving a bright purity to the kiwi, Key lime pie, pineapple custard and crème brûlée flavors. Lots of toasty new French oak and lees bring super creaminess to the mouthfeel. White Burgundy is the model, expressed California-style.",US
6923,US,"Plenty of richness here, mangoes, pineapple custard, Key lime pie, not to mention smoky, caramelly, butterscotchy oak, but there's also a streamlined, sleek minerality that leaves a lip-smacking steely feeling behind. Part of that is acidity. Really fine wine.",US
6924,US,"This is a high acid style of Chardonnay, reflective of a vintage that was one of the coolest in a decade or more. Crisp and detailed, this offers a classy mix of citrus and apple, wet stone and light baking spices. Hints of nutmeg and cinnamon adorn the fruit, which lingers gently through a citrusy finish.",US
6925,US,"This is quite a hefty young Chard. It takes the basic elements of ripe, potent fruit, oak, and Burgundian-inspired technique and elevates it all, a Chard on steroids. The peach, tropical fruit, pear, candied ginger and charry oak flavors have an acidic scour. Drink now and for the next 5 years.",US
6926,US,"With no oak, the pure, brilliantly ripe Chardonnay fruit shines through in this rewarding wine. It's so rich in tropical fruit, peach, pear and citrus flavors, you won't even miss the barrel influence. Best of all is the cool-climate crispness that makes the finish so clean and vibrant.",US
6927,US,"The cool 2005 growing season benefited this wine. It's dry and balanced and quite elegant, with delicious flavors of peaches, buttered popcorn and caramel.",US
6928,US,"Simple, sweet and cloying, with sugary flavors of pineapples, peaches and pears.",US
6929,US,"Bob Cabral has crafted a wine that combines purity of fruit with power and silky elegance. The wine explodes with baked apricot, nectarine and guava flavors, the kind of fruit filling that oozes out of a buttery tart fresh from the oven. Yet bright acidity balances it out. Oak adds the perfect touch of vanilla and marzipan.",US
6930,US,"Beautiful Chardonnay, ripe, rich, oaky and complex, the kind you fall in love with from the start. Crisp in acids, it flatters the palate with pineapple custard and crème brûlée flavors that are as deep and long as they are broad. Perhaps a shade less rich than the fabulous '03, but a gorgeous, succulent wine.",US
6931,US,"Another success from this vineyard, which supplies Chardonnay to some of the best producers in the state. Perfect structure, matching acid and mineral to citrus fruit, juice and rind. Fragrant, textural and deep.",US
6932,US,"This isn't one of those rich, gooey Chardonnays that dazzle some people. But it's a crisp, minerally wine that shows great elegance and Chablis-like sophistication. Dry and crisp, it shows complex flavors of tart green apples and pears, with subtle influences of smoky oak.",US
6933,US,"Ultrarich and oaky, with vanilla, buttered toast, caramel and smoky flavors accenting the underlying pineapple, guava, nectarine and pear fruits. This opulent wine will meld and become mellow in another 2–3 years.",US
6934,US,"For the first time the fruit was sourced from Conner Lee vineyard old vines. It's a glorious wine, a near-perfect mix of citrus and stone, kissed with honey and dust, lightly buttery. Fermented mostly with native yeast, this is one of the best Washington Chardonnays of a very good vintage.",US
6935,US,"Made in a very oaky, Sonoma Coast style that emphasizes enormously ripe fruit and crisp acids. The green apple, pineapple tart and pear flavors are enriched with vanilla, buttered toast and butterscotch Lifesaver sour candy. Flamboyant and dramatic, but not an ager, so drink young.",US
6936,US,"From the wildest, most remote and exotic stretch of the Sonoma Coast: you can taste the salt of the sea in this wine, as you can in a Manzanilla Sherry. It gives a tang to the lemondrop, pear and honeysuckle flavors, with their lick of cold granite. So pure and vibrant, so savory, so compelling. Grows more fascinating with every minute in the glass.",US
6937,US,"Here's a pull out all the stops, bells and whistles Chard that aims to compete at a high level. Barrel fermented in 80% new oak, aged on the lees and put through full malolactic fermentation, it's rich, creamy, buttery and exotically flavored in opulent toasted barrel and tropical fruits. I personally like this style, but others might find it too oaky.",US
6938,US,"Tropical fruit aromas mingle with toasted oak on the nose of this elegant wine from Finger Lakes pioneer Dr. Frank. On the palate, the wine offers appealing and balanced flavors of creamy vanilla, spice and vibrant, lively fruit, making it an excellent choice for everything from salmon to spicier Asian cuisine.",US
6939,US,"Geyser Peak's Reserve Chards have been pretty good lately, as they learn how to bring balance to grapes that ripen so easily. The '05 is plenty ripe, packed with jammy apricot, tangerine and oaky vanilla custard and butterscotch flavors. It's a rich, exotic wine, with good enough acidity for balance.",US
6940,US,"Shows the dried hay and light tobacco herbalness that sometimes accompany Carneros Chards, with riper notes of pineapples. When the oak kicks it, it brings smoke, buttered toast, toasted coconut and vanilla. This is a very dry wine to have with a wide range of foods.",US
6941,US,"If you're a fan of big, oaky Chards, you'll like this one. It's rich and unctuous in ripe tropical fruit custard flavors, with the buttered toast, crème brûlée and smoky char that comes from new French barrels. But it has a perky acidity that lends it an appley, minerally note.",US
6942,US,"The winery must have held this back this long to let the acidity soften, but it's still a crisp Chardonnay. A big one, too, packed with tropical fruit, roasted coconut, creamy lees, steely mineral and new oak flavors. Give it until 2007 to resolve itself.",US
6943,US,"At four-plus years, the wine is hanging in there, maintaining fruit and freshness and picking up some aged, dried pineapple and peach character. It's an interesting wine, picking up textural complexities, but needs to be drunk soon.",US
6944,US,"For such a large production Chard, this one gives a lot of concentrated varietal purity. It's dry and crisp, brimming with ripe pineapple, green apple, Key lime pie, pear, date and smoky vanilla flavors that finish with real sophistication and class.",US
6945,US,"This lovely wine is light but tempting, with sweet herb, yellow apple and pale peach fruit flavors. The wine is not pushed past the limits of the fruit, but all the flavor and focus possible have been extracted from these grapes. Beautifully balanced and perfect for a mix of light seafood or cheese.",US
6946,US,"Napa-based Fisher has a new Chardonnay vineyard in Sonoma, 1,300 feet up, and these Dijon clones have produced an intense wine. The grapes were picked very ripe, and the wine is huge in pear and crème brûlée flavors, with zesty acidity. Impressive for its size and interest. You keep reaching for another glass.",US
6947,US,"You can't smell acidity, but you can smell fruit so bright, it has to be high in acidity. This Chard is rewardingly pure and sharp in Key lime pie, papaya purée, fresh juicy tangerine and smoky, vanilla-infused oak flavors, and it grows more interesting with every sip.",US
6948,US,"Mixed into the blend are smallish proportions of Muscat, Pinot Grigio, Riesling and Gewürztraminer, and this is not really trying to be Chardonnay. It's a dry, tart, all-purpose, everyday white wine, which you can serve with confidence and almost any style of white-wine food you can cook up.",US
6949,US,"Made in a fresh, clean, lighthearted style, this immaculate Chardonnay shows no signs of new oak. The fruit is crisp apple, the acids bracing and lightly mineral, and it's a palate-cleaning wine that should be served chilled for maximum refreshment.",US
6950,US,"Shows a welcome return to form after the '06. This time, the butterscotchy oak plays a supporting role, allowing the pineapple, pear, guava and mineral flavors to shine. Beautiful and elegant.",US
6951,US,"The vineyard is the source of fantastic Pinot Noirs and Chardonnays for several wineries, and Barnett scores big points with this lush, rich but balanced wine. It's tremendous in pineapple, pear, green apple and oaky vanilla flavors, but beautifully balanced with firm acidity. Represents an impressive step forward for this bottling.",US
6952,US,"A beautiful Chardonnay with so much class and elegance, it's a bargain at this price. Shows lush flavors of pineapple crème brûlée, Meyer lemon custard and vanilla sorbet, balanced with crisp acidity and a fine touch of smoky oak. Perfect with shellfish.",US
6953,US,"A lovely Chardonnay, dry, elegant and minerally. Displays real control, with the pineapple, lemondrop candy, apricot and oak flavors balanced by crisp acidity. Easily as good as Chards costing far more, which makes it a value.",US
6954,US,"ultrarich, maybe too much so for elegance, with powerful caramel and vanilla crème brûlée flavors overpowering the pineapples, peaches and green apples. Still, there's no denying the deliciousness. Crisp acidity fortunately provides balance.",US
6955,US,"A dry, and elegant fruit-forward wine. It was harvested relatively early, at lower brix, resulting in crisp acidity and succulent flavors of tart green apples and kiwis, with a tang of pepper and cinnamon. Delicious.",US
6956,US,"Here's a bright, exotically fruity Chard that satisfies all around for its lime, kiwi, butterscotch, fig, honey and toast flavors and brisk, cleansing acidity. Drink this yummy wine now.",US
6957,US,"“Nu” seems to be Kunde's way of letting us know that this is an unoaked Chardonnay. It shows pure, untrammelled Chard flavors of green apples, peaches, pears, kiwis and limes. It's also a very crisp wine, as it did not undergo the malolactic fermentation.",US
6958,US,"Racy acidity characterizes this ripely fruity, oaky wine. It's strong in pineapple, apricot and tangerine cream flavors, while plenty of new French oak contributes a spicy, vanilla-infused smokiness. A bit obvious, but certainly a delicious, captivating Chardonnay.",US
6959,US,"The blend includes 5% Viognier, an interesting choice that brings in floral scents and provides counterweight to the ramped up oaky seasonings. It's a curious mix that doesn't quite knit together, but makes for a more complex wine than you would expect. There's some sweet spice in the finish.",US
6960,US,"Rich and oaky, with lavish flavors of vanilla custard, smoky meringue and créme brulée. The fruit consists of ripe pineapples and Meyer lemons.",US
6961,US,"This is all Sundance vineyard, beautifully executed. It's got a ton of character, intensity, and brilliant, bright fruit. The acids are natural and flavors run through the citrus spectrum, from lime to pineapple, with great persistence.",US
6962,US,"Big and bold, a ripe, oaky Chardonnay that needs some time in the cellar to come together. Offers tiers of apricot, pear, peach and nectarine flavors, with a stony minerality and crisp acidity that makes the mouth water. Bone dry and complex, this Chablisian Chardonnay will blossom some time in 2010.",US
6963,US,"A lush expression of buttered brioche, Key lime, toasted nuts and light tropical fruit, nicely woven together. It gains fullness as it breathes and opens up right in the mouth. The finish extends and details beautifully, without relying on superripe fruit or excessive oak.",US
6964,US,"Achieves the alchemy of well-toasted oak and perfectly ripe fruit to produce this luscious, creamy Chardonnay. Mangoes, papayas, pineapple custard, caramel, vanilla, it's all there, along with crisp, balancing acidity.",US
6965,US,"This is a really nice Chardonnay. Sebastiani knows how to make a balanced varietal wine, and this clean, ripe Chardonnay completely satisfies, with fruity flavors and a rich balance of creamy oak, coastal acidity and spicy oak.",US
6966,US,"Represents a very nice value in a refreshing, balanced Chardonnay. The wine, which was aged in lots of new American oak and stirred on the lees, is rich and creamy, with citrus, mineral and yeasty flavors that are brightened by crisp acidity.",US
6967,US,"Shows the crisp acidity that usually marks Carneros Chards, and also an earthy, freshly picked herb quality to the jammy peach, pineapple and green apple flavors. Consider it a food-worthy Chardonnay. Drink now.",US
6968,US,"There's massive flavor in this wine, made from young Dijon clone vines. It's a real bomb blast of juicy apricot, pineapple custard, white peach nectar, tapioca and honeysuckle, with a tangy mineral flourish. Almost too rich for its own good, but retains balance, with good acidity.",US
6969,US,"Made in a softly flamboyant style, with massive flavors of citrus and tropical fruits, buttered toast, cinnamon and crème brûlée, firmed with stony minerals. Tons of stuffing in this opulent Chardonnay, which was aged in 50% new oak.",US
6970,US,"There's a lot of oak on this Chard, sourced from multiple vineyards, and the barrel influences currently dominate, with the vanilla, butterscotch and caramel flavors many people confuse with the taste of Chardonnay itself. In this case, the underlying pineapple, pear and green apple fruit is ample enough to support all that weight.",US
6971,US,"Ripe, lush and immediately attractive, this Chard offers rich tiers of pineapple custard, pear marmalade, vanilla, buttered toast, toasted coconut and Asian spice flavors. It's a strong, flamboyant wine that calls for equally strong foods, like lobster.",US
6972,US,"Lush enough to drink now, with decanting, but this powerfully ripe Chard will benefit from limited aging. It's explosive in oak-infused pineapple, papaya, peach, green apple and Asian spice flavors, but right now the oak is not integrated with the fruit, making for a disjointed quality. Give it until mid-2008, and for a couple years after.",US
6973,US,"Shows the richness of fruit, as well as oak, that has lately characterized this Monterey-grown Chardonnay, with very ripe pineapple and crème brûlée flavors. Feels somewhat obvious, lacking the subtle appeal of the 2007. Drink now.",US
6974,US,"Marked by a lean minerality, this Chablis-style wine is not one of those fat, opulent Chards that dazzles with sheer richness. It's more subtle than that, and more acidic. Structure, in fact, is the name of the game here, with its lemon and lime flavors that barely break into green apples. Fine now, if not served too cold, and for the next 2–4 years. Beyond that, wines of this kind go quickly downhill.",US
6975,US,"Pure and detailed, this lovely Chardonnay carves its way through the palate with layers of pear tart, apple crisp, brioche and almond paste. It is an elegant wine, light and penetrating, with a finish that seems to linger forever.",US
6976,US,"Brisk and ripe, this Chard, from a cool region on San Luis Obispo, shows a classic profile of pure kiwi and lime fruit flavor. A layer of oak adds caramel, butterscotch and vanilla flavors. It all finishes in a long, spicy swirl of orange blossom honey.",US
6977,US,"There's a minerality to this pleasantly dry Chard, a stony tang that dominates, although you'll find pineapple underpinnings. It's a leaner, more elegant style, and the winemaker has tried to enrich it with oak, sur lie aging and 50% malolactic fermentation.",US
6978,US,"This is a new, reserve-style wine from veteran Ferrari-Carano. It shows its cool-climate origins in the brisk acidity that boosts well-ripened pineapple tart, green apple sauce, and Key lime pie flavors. It's also extremely oaky, and would be a better wine if it had less barrel influence.",US
6979,US,"I found the winery's regular '04 disappointing. This commemorative bottling is oakier and much riper in tropical fruit flavors, with non-malolactic crisp acidity and a buttercream texture. Somehow, though, it lacks the power and follow-through a great Chard should have, especially at this price.",US
6980,US,"Lots of rich, ripe, forward fruit in this well-oaked wine, with tart green apple, pineapple, lime and kiwi flavors. It's stylishly dry, with a nice, creamy finish.",US
6981,US,"Made in a less ripe style, with citrusy, herbal flavors that are well-oaked and leesy, this very dry Chard displays both elegance and a long finish. If you're into aging Chardonnays, try cellaring this through 2010. Should be fine.",US
6982,US,"Lots of flash in this relatively inexpensive Chardonnay, which shares many of the qualities of far more expensive wines. Flamboyantly ripe tropical fruit, opulent oak with creamy buttered toast and vanilla, a rich, voluptuous texture, waves of complexity and crisp, balancing cool-climate acidity—it's all there.",US
6983,US,"Bright acids liven up very ripe papaya, pineapple and Key lime pie flavors, wrapped in a rich, creamy texture. The wine finishes with lots of spicy, smoky oak.",US
6984,US,"This Chard is straightforward and tasty, showing the bright acidity and laser-pure fruit that Edna Valley is known for. The Meyer lemon, lime and kiwi flavors are firmed up with brilliant acidity leading to an impressively long, spicy finish.",US
6985,US,"Younger and a bit more raw than the '03, and the oak is sticking out more boldly, but this should be a fine bottle in much the same fashion as its predecessor in a year or so. There's a purity throughout that's outstanding.",US
6986,US,"Tight, taut and lemony, a Chablis-like Chardonnay of extreme dryness and minerality. Shows mouthwatering flavors of flint, Meyer lemons and limes, with a touch of smoky oak. Very fine and elegant, a beautiful Chardonnay that will support, not overwhelm, food.",US
6987,US,"This unoaked Chard is bright and exuberant in ripe green fruits, such as Granny Smith apples, kiwis, limes, table grapes and mangoes. Acidity in this cool vintage is very high, and when I tasted it, it still had some fizzy fermentation. Technically this is a flaw, but it didn't interefere with my enjoyment.",France
6988,US,"Don't look for richness at this price, but you will find a clean, straightforward wine, with supple, ripe fruit flavors and surprising midpalate weight. There's nothing flabby, watery, thin or fake about it.",France
6989,US,"Big and bold, a Chard that shows off its terroir in the crisp, citrusy acidity and clean purity of fruit. The flavors veer toward pineapples and green tropical fruits. Oak plays a very prominent role, perhaps a little too much so, in this dry wine.",US
6990,US,"This is aromatic and enchanting, loaded with very pretty scents of citrus blossom and lime. The fruit blends sweet apple, lemon/lime and juicy white peach. It's a luscious Chardonnay that relies on the perfectly ripened fruit to deliver the flavors, and succeeds beautifully. All Dijon clones, with a splash of Viognier lifting up the nose.",US
6991,US,"Gallo has held this Chard more than 4 years before release; the reason may be an acidic tightness that still dominates the wine. It's deep in mineral-infused apricot and quince fruit. The barrel regimen consisted of 100% new oak. It's a big, absolutely dry, almost rasping wine, and may be one of those rare California Chards capable of aging. See what it does after 2008.",US
6992,US,"Shows slightly sweet flavors of pineapple marmalade, green apple tart, honeysuckle and buttered toast, fortunately balanced with crisp, citrusy acidity. It was made from grapes grown in the Los Alamos region of Santa Barbara County.",US
6993,US,"Tastes of new oak and is also acidic, a combo that makes the mouthfeel rather harsh and salty, despite obviously well-ripened fruit. May settle down and show softer, lusher notes in a year or so.",US
6994,US,"Shows classic Edna Valley Chardonnay structure and flavor, a brightly acidic, minerally wine with a great burst of Key lime pie, ripe kiwi, pineapple custard, honey and vanilla oak flavors.",US
6995,US,"From a cool appellation in a cool vintage, a balanced, drily crisp Chardonnay. Oak dominates, with toast, butterscotch and vanilla notes riding high over underlying green apple and kiwi fruit.",US
6996,US,"This soft and seductive wine is reminiscent of a good Chassagne-Montrachet from a relatively warm year. It has the same ripe, lightly tropical fruit, inflected with citrus and buoyed by firm acidity. The use of oak is restrained, the balance perfect, and the finish long and satisfying.",US
6997,US,"Lots to like in this dry, fruity Chardonnay. It has flavors of tropical fruits, buttered toast and caramel, wrapped into a rich, creamy mouthfeel. But it's pretty acidic, if you're sensitive to prickliness in your wines.",US
6998,US,"Very dry, with apricot, hard mineral and citrus flavors, this Chard gets better as it breathes and warms up in the glass. It's a bit quirky, but has terroir-inspired complexity and interest.",US
6999,US,"A little weedy, despite lots of flashy oak. The pineapples and peaches have notes of dried dill and thyme, and the finish is dry and crisp. Nice with broiled halibut in a thyme-butter sauce.",US
7000,US,"Big, bold, and buttery, with plenty of oaky micro-popcorn flavors. Don't look for subtlety, but you get plenty of flavor.",US
7001,US,"It's all there in this Chardonnay, with barrel influences of butterscotch and toast, crisp Russian River acidity, and ripe flavors of pineapples, Meyer lemons, limes and green apples. Feels a bit sharp, so don't over-chill, and you can even give it a decant.",US
7002,US,"A very rich, somewhat jammy Chardonnay, brimming with pie-filling flavors of pineapples, pears and peaches. Oak adds even richer notes of crème brûlée and buttered toast. Drink now.",US
7003,US,"Ultradry and tart in acidity, this is not a Chardonnay for those looking for richness. With citrus and mineral flavors, it's suggestive of a young, minor Chablis. Clean and vibrant. Drink now.",US
7004,US,"The vineyard is on the Carneros border, and this Chard has lots of juicy acidity, which may also be due to the winemaker picking the grapes at a relatively low ripeness level. The pepper- and mineral-infused flavors suggest peaches and grapefruits, enriched with new oak and lees. This is an extremely dry, food-friendly wine.",US
7005,US,"Almost sweet in pineapple custard, marzipan and butterscotch flavors, and there may even be a bit of residual sugar in this honey-rich Chard. Saved by a crisp backbone of acidity.",US
7006,US,"Shows what is becoming the classic profile of unoaked, cool-climate Chard. Clean, crisp and minerally, the wine shows high-toned flavors of ripe kiwis, limes, passionfruit, pineapples, green apples, vanilla and cinnamon-spice. A match for scallops with mango salsa.",US
7007,US,"Good everyday Chard, with direct flavors of pineapples and kiwis, and the buttercream and smoky vanillins that oak barrels contribute. Finishes dry and crisp.",US
7008,US,"Still quite young yet unmistakably lush, this bottling immediately shows fresh apples, white peach and plenty of new oak from 100% barrel fermentation. The lip-smacking acidity keeps fruit and oak in balance; all that is needed is a bit more bottle age. Decant it if you plan to drink it immediately.",US
7009,US,"Rich and full bodied, this is a tremendously ripe Chardonnay that explodes with peach custard, orange popsicle, pineapple, crème brûlée and cinnamon spice flavors, leading to a long, fruity finish.",US
7010,US,"The big acidity on this wine and the citrus fruit flavors make it kind of austere and minerally. But partial new oak and sur lie aging add some richness. This is a very dry, elegant, structural Chard meant for food. Try with a firm white fish topped with a fruity salsa.",US
7011,US,"Polished and fruity, with ripe peach custard, nectarine, pear and spicy green apple flavors enriched with the vanilla and buttered toast of oak barrels. Crisp acidity makes the wine racy.",US
7012,US,"Much like the winery's pleasing Pinot Gris, this Dijon clone Chard is made in a clean, lightly herbal style. Roughly half was barrel fermented and half in stainless, all resting sur lie for twelve months. Along with the crisp apple flavors and sweet grass are hints of wet stone and a gentle impression of bourbon barrel.",US
7013,US,"Here's a fine, distinctive Chardonnay. It possesses classic Edna acidity and forward citrus and mineral flavors, with a luscious interweaving of honeysuckle. The wine is thoroughly dry and quite delicious.",France
7014,US,"A terrific Chardonnay. You won't miss the oak at all. Offers a wealth of pineapple pie, Meyer lemon sorbet, green apple jam and vanilla flavors, brightened by clean, crisp coastal acidity. Sommeliers, buy this one in quantity. Easy to find, with 45,000 cases produced.",US
7015,US,"This is a big, oaky, creamy Chardonnay, but it retains the crisp acidity and overall control to be balanced and even elegant despite its size. Shows potent flavors of pineapple-infused crème brûlée, butterscotch and vanilla custard. Drink now.",US
7016,US,"Bright and zesty, with flavors of limes, kiwi fruit, green apples and pineapples, accompanied by crisp acidity. Could almost be an Edna Valley Chardonnay. Oak plays only a supporting role.",US
7017,US,"Mer Soleil Chards seem to get bigger, riper and oakier every year. Of course, this is the winery's style, and when it works, the results can be fabulously rich, but this caramelized wine seems a little top-heavy.",US
7018,US,"Fogarty's basic '05 Chard shows an exciting crispness and minerality that, good as it is, makes you long for the single-vineyard bottlings to come. There's an elegant angularity to the wine despite the succulent pineapples, kiwis and new oak, and a brisk acidity that makes it finish vibrantly clean.",US
7019,US,"The 2006 Chardonnay is another excellent bottle from this Oregon négociant, offering ripe and luscious fruit flavors of pear, apple, quince and kiwi. As the wine broadens out across the palate, streaks of spice, nutmeg, honey and graham cracker appear. It retains its acidic underpinnings through a generous, creamy finish.",US
7020,US,"Very ripe and fruity, a Chardonnay that trades sheer opulence for subtlety or complexity. Offers oak-inspired flavors of buttered toast, pineapple Lifesaver candy, lemondrop and vanilla crème brûlée in a creamy texture.",US
7021,US,"Many wineries have taken fruit from this vineyard, generally with good results. The '05 Lucas & Lewellen shows its terroir, with a cool-climate crispness backing up ripe pineapple tart, nectarine and papaya flavors. But the oak-inspired caramel, char and butterscotch is a bit heavy-handed.",US
7022,US,"Here's your basic straightforward upscale California Chard. It's forward in tropical fruit and oaky butterscotch and vanilla char flavors, wrapped into a creamy texture. There's a touch of green in the finish, though.",US
7023,US,"Here's a rich Chardonnay with tropical fruit pastry flavors that have a dusty, dried herb edge, and lots of creamy oak. The wine is a bit soft. The fruit and spice flavors reprise on the long-lasting finish.",US
7024,US,"Richer and tarter than Kenwood's regular '05 Chard, this wine shows the acidity and green apple flavors of the central part of the valley. Bosc pears, Meyer lemons and white peaches pleasantly complicate things as you continue to sip.",US
7025,US,"What a nice wine for this price. It's so dry and crisp and minerally and easy to drink, with enough sophistication to satisfy even fussy wine snobs. The subtle flavors include lemons, limes and smoky oak.",US
7026,US,"Pavilion has a perfect record with Chardonnay, four vintages in a row with a consistent score. The ‘06 like its predecessors is ripe and satisfying, with good varietal character. The peach and pineapple flavors have creamy, smoky nuances.",US
7027,US,"Although it has spent quite a bit of time in bottle, this wine still seems overweighted to its oak – the barrel flavors, woody and slightly bitter, overwhelm the golden apple fruit. It seems to be fading already, a bit past its peak.",US
7028,US,"Pretty nice for a Chard of this everyday price. Made by 7-Eleven for sale in their stores, it's dry and creamy, with good varietal flavors of peaches, pears and apple butter, and is a good value.",US
7029,US,"Acidity marks this Chardonnay. It gives a tart, mouth-cleansing citrusy scour to the lemon and lime and pineapple flavors that finish so dry. It's a minimalist wine, with a minerally frame, and quite good with shellfish.",US
7030,US,"Nice and dry, with crisp, citrusy acidity and a touch of creamy oak. Shows savory flavors of Meyer lemons, limes and tingly Asian spices, with a touch of green apple butter. Clean and food-friendly.",US
7031,US,"Really nice, fragrant and floral with lovely clover and peach highlights. It's dusty and elegant, a truly stylish and very affordable Chardonnay. There's just a bit of sharpness in the finish, gently fading into toast.",US
7032,US,"Lots of oak on this fresh, young Chard. It's a bit too heavy on the char, toast, vanilla, and woodsap, and not enough about the peaches, pears and pineapples.",US
7033,US,"Light and pleasant, but not up to the richness of the sensational 2005. This has light flavors suggestive of pineapple, cracker and a hint of mint. It's pleasant drinking, but generic.",US
7034,US,"There's no oak to give fans their daily dose of buttered toast and vanilla. But there is plenty of pure, unadulterated fruit—apricots and peaches to be exact. It's a rich, spicy wine that advances the argument for no-oak Chard.",US
7035,US,"This is St. Supery's other Chardonnay, the oaked one. It's not super-oaky, but it does have buttercream and vanilla notes in addition to the wine's apricot, peach and tangerine flavors. It's a very dry, somewhat tart but elegant wine.",US
7036,US,Aromas of apple and tropical fruit on this rich Chardonnay lead into vanilla and honey on the palate. The wine is full and opulent in the mouth but not overwrought. Good balance and a lingering finish add to the appeal.,US
7037,US,"With jammy peach, apricot, pear and pineapple fruit flavors, this is a pretty nice everyday Chard, at a fair price. It has a creamy texture and a spicy aftertaste.",US
7038,US,"With racy acidity, this palate-cleansing Chard shows a firm minerality undergirding Key lime pie filling and oaky, vanilla flavors. Fully dry, it's a good food Chard. Try with a creamy mushroom risotto.",US
7039,US,"Grown in the region between Carneros and Yountville, this Chard has good acidity, with juicy lime, peach, mango and smoky oak flavors. It's a great food Chardonnay, with a round, supple quality that is very high toned.",US
7040,US,"The estate is in the southern end of the appellation, toward Paso Robles, and this full-bodied Chard smacks of apricot preserves, with a spicy, peppery edge. It's adequately acidic and oaked, with a rich, creamy texture.",US
7041,US,"The vineyard is on the cooler western edge of Paso Robles, and this bottling has been getting better over the years. The '07 is the best yet, a dry, crisp wine of richness and polish. Shows pineapple, nectarine and guava flavors, with a subtle minerality, creamy mouthfeel, and a fine coating of smoky oak.",US
7042,US,"Fancy, with racy acidity and rich oak framing ripe natural flavors of pineapple brûlée, pear concentrate and Meyer lemon essence. Rich, but balanced and elegant.",US
7043,US,"This wine is very, very dry and minerally-lean, with a scour of acidity. The cleansing mouthfeel and the versatility it shows at the table with food are pluses.",US
7044,US,"With no oak influences at all, this Chard is on the acidic side, with bright, clean flavors of green grapes, yellow apricots and fresh pineapples. It's dry, but rich in fruity essence.",US
7045,US,"This unoaked Chardonnay offers great complexity at an affordable everyday price. It's dry and elegantly balanced with crisp acids. Rich flavors of pineapples, Meyer lemons, limes and vanilla  hardly need wood for richness.",US
7046,US,"Shows the very dry herbal, floral and tobacco flavors that often mark Napa Chardonnays (and the vineyard is on the Napa side of Carneros). But there's a good core of tropical citrus fruits, while oak adds needed richness of smoky vanilla and buttered toast. Drink now.",US
7047,US,"This is a ripely fruity wine with a dollop of French oak that's a textbook example of Lodi. Soft in acids, with powerful tropical fruit, nectarine, peach, pear and apple flavors, it offers clean, easy drinking.",US
7048,US,"Pretty good wine for 10 bucks. It's dry and crisp, in the Monterey style, with good citrus fruit and mineral flavors that are accented by sweet oak.",US
7049,US,"Bone dry, acidic and minerally, this isn't very Chard-like in terms of richness of fruit. But it's clean and pleasantly sippable, with modest apple and lime flavors.",US
7050,US,"Alderbrook's winemaker could have made a big, fruity wine in this warm vintage, but seems to have decided to make a more delicate, higher-acid Chard instead. This food-friendly sipper has nice peach, apple and pineapple flavors, and is balanced, dry and elegant.",US
7051,US,"This is all Birch Creek vineyard, barrel fermented, 100% malo, about one third new wood, one third one year, the rest neutral. It's a soft, fleshy, buttery, California style, but nothing overblown. There's plenty of new oak flavor, good ripe fruit, and enough acid to support the yellow apple and melon fruit.",US
7052,US,"A fine Chardonnay, which Ferrari-Carano can usually be depended on to produce. Shows crowd-pleasing flavors of pineapple jam, butterscotch, crème brûlée and vanilla custard. Easy to find, with 42,000 cases produced.",US
7053,US,"This Chardonnay marches to its own beat. It's not one of those oaky, ultra-ripe wines, but instead shows a dry, herb-infused minerality you might call Chablisian. Shows modest fruit flavors of pineapples, while the oak is restrained. Drink this elegant Chard now.",US
7054,US,"A very lush, fruity wine, if a bit soft, with flavors of pineapples, lemon custard, buttered toast and smoky vanilla. Satisfies for its richness and creamy texture.",US
7055,US,"The wine's a blend of top Chard growing regions, but it's a little thin in flavor, with watered-down apricot and peach flavors.",US
7056,US,"Shows nice pineapple tart, lemondrop, buttered toast and vanilla oak flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Finishes quick and could be more concentrated, but it's a very good, elegant Chardonnay at a fair price.",US
7057,US,"A very nice Chardonnay marked by crisp dryness and fine structure, which highlights the pleasant varietal flavors. Offers a nice array of pineapples, peaches, apricots and green apples, accented by the smoky vanilla of oak and grounded in minerals.",US
7058,US,"Quite a nice Chardonnay, especially at this price. It's elegant and crisp, with a mineral undertow to the pineapple, buttered toast and honeysuckle flavors. Easy to like for its balance.",US
7059,US,"A junior version of the very fine Reserve, the '05 is ripe and forward in tropical fruit and flowery spice flavors, with an overlay of smoky, creamy oak. It's explosive, but balanced and controlled.",US
7060,US,"Here's a modest, likeable Chard, a bit soft, with pear, apple, peach and cream flavors. It's extremely well balanced, and has a satisfyingly long finish. Great with roast chicken or grilled fish with a brown butter sauce.",US
7061,US,"A beautifully elegant, refined Chardonnay. Because it's not overloaded with oak, it displays the basic finesse of the grapes from this cool-climate vineyard. Crisp and dry, it's rich and complex in citrus, tropical fruit, peach, mineral and honeysuckle flavors, at a fair price.",US
7062,US,"A little on the thin side, fruit-wise, although there's a wealth of toasty oak, and the wine possesses that bright acidity so associated with the vineyard and appellation. The flavors veer toward apricots and papayas. While official alcohol is only 14.5%, the finish is chili-pepper hot.",US
7063,US,"Here's a basic, Santa Barbara Chardonnay that shows off the region's cool-climate friendliness to the variety. It's dry and crisp and creamy, with pineapple, lime and oak flavors.",US
7064,US,"Solidly in the winery's house style, this is a clean, varietally true Chard, dry and balanced. It shows citrus, green apple and mineral flavors, while partial barrel fermentation adds elements of smoky cream and buttered toast.",US
7065,US,"Streamlined, with mineral, Mandarin orange and oak flavors. This pleasant Chard, from estate vineyards in the warm Sonoma Valley, is dry and balanced.",US
7066,US,"Bright and tart in green apple and pink grapefruit flavors that have high, puckery acidity, this Chard from the Sonoma side of the appellation is softened with the buttercream of oak and lees. Try with lemon chicken.",US
7067,US,"Shows mouthwatering acidity and long hangtime flavors of pineapple essence, papaya, butterscotch, vanilla crème brûlée and toast, yet for all that richness, finishes dry. This is a good price for all that richness.",US
7068,US,"A controversial wine due to its amazing power. It's just tremendous in apricot, peach, nectarine, marzipan and crème brûlée flavors, like some dainty from a great pastry chef. But this oversized quality makes it difficult to enjoy with food. Almost better on its own as a cocktail sipper.",US
7069,US,"Huge, rich, white Burgundy style Chardonnay. Has a pie-filling fruity richness of pineapples, lemondrop, pears, kiwi fruit and exotic kumquats, balanced with fine, minerally acidity, and wrapped into a buttercream texture. The oak is flamboyant, but perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume. Dazzling and dramatic, from a vineyard that just keeps performing better and better.",US
7070,US,"Guaranteed to please the most discriminating Chardonnay fans for its dry crispness, great structure and endless opulence. Massively complex, offering waves of grilled pineapple, pear, buttered toast and smoky vanilla. The grapes came mainly from Bien Nacido Vineyard, with the balance from Sierra Madre. Only 338 cases produced.",US
7071,US,"Bob Cabral's Chardonnays sometimes get lost in the brilliant glare of his Pinot Noirs, but he has spent years exploring the rich, flamboyant side of the variety, with great success. This bottling represents William Selyem Chardonnay at its best. It's ultra-decadent in apricot and pear flavors, with a strong oak influence, and yet an underlying minerality and fine acidity balance it so that it doesn't tire as you drink. In fact, you want more.",US
7072,US,"Massively rich, with pronounced, sweet, smoky oak flavors and a rich vein of tart, creamy lees highlighting the underlying fruity ripeness. Shows flavors of grilled pineapples, tropical mangoes and pears, balanced with crisp acids. Tremendously delicious and compelling.",US
7073,US,"Amazingly rich, one of the most opulent Chardonnays you can drink now. Just wows the mouth with pineapple, pear, exotic tropical fruit, crème brûlée, vanilla custard, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors that go on and on through the finish. Also shows fine, tart acidity, which provides needed balance. Yes, it's superripe, but this is what California Chardonnay does at its best.",US
7074,US,"Massive, opulent, oozing in pineapple créme brulée, honey, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors. Totally decadent, and fortunately set off with brisk, citrusy acidity. Calling all lobsters, and don't forget the drawn butter. Sheer hedonism in a glass, at a fantastic price.",US
7075,US,"Massively fruity and oaky, this is an atom bomb of a Chardonnay. You either love this style or you hate it. The pineapple tart, apricot, pear, peach, crème brûlée, buttered toast, vanilla cream and cinnamon spice flavors go on and on. Beyond the utter richness is firm acidity and a bracing minerality. Defines California-style decadence, but drink now, as the wine will quickly go downhill.",US
7076,US,"Superrich, ripe and flamboyant, if not particularly subtle. Dazzles for its tsunami of grilled pineapple custard, pear tart, golden mango and Key lime pie richness, accented with sweetly, caramelized oak, and brightened with brisk acidity. A racy, decadent crowd pleaser.",US
7077,US,"Nice and direct in ripe fruit and oak flavors, this is textbook proper Chardonnay. The flavors are of tropical fruits and spice, the texture is creamy, the finish is long and spicy.",US
7078,US,"Great price for a Chard of this quality. Dry, crisp and amply flavored in peaches and cream, tangerines and buttered toast, it has the richness of more costly wines.",US
7079,US,"Chard doesn't get any riper, unless it's late harvest. Floods the mouth with peach custard, pineapple, guava, nectarine and apple flavors, with a rich, creamy, oaky finish. It's a bit one-dimensional, but what a tasty dimension.",US
7080,US,"There's just too much oak on this otherwise fine Chard. It's like drinking toothpicks, all sweet vanilla char, toasted meringue and caramel. Too bad, because the underlying wine is filled with polished mineral and fruit flavors.",US
7081,US,"Oak stars in this Chard—too much oak, in fact. Vanilla, char, wood sap, woody spice and smoke tastes dominate the tropical fruit, peach and citrus flavors.",US
7082,US,"Made in a different style from most Sonoma Chards, this wine is less about fruit than minerals. It has a steely mouthfeel, with mouthwatering acidity and hints of citrus zest. Could almost be a Sauvignon Blanc.",France
7083,US,"From the cooler, southeast part of the valley, but the wine still has that heavy softness that so many Napa Chards have, with the flavor of pears and oak. Tasty enough, but lacks the vital spark you get from cooler climates.",US
7084,US,"Beaucoup butter, caramel and toasted nut flavors; 80% of this reserve Chardonnay went through malolactic. It's got plenty of fruit power and acid; but it's mostly the French oak barrel flavors that stand out at this young age.",US
7085,US,"Big, oaky and loaded with butterscotch, this is a lush take on Chardonnay, mixing rich streaks of tropical fruit and pear with new oak flavors powered by buttered toast and butterscotch. It's big, broad and yummy – what more do you want?",US
7086,US,"Still young-looking, with a touch of green to the pale yellow color, this wine offers white fruit aromas in addition to burnt popcorn. The oak is more subdued in the mouth, where toasty flavors play a secondary role to white fruits and citrus.",US
7087,US,"A nose of papaya, white fruit, and lemon verbena is pleasant, while the mouthfeel has nice balance, smooth and round without being fat. Has cantaloupe and tropical fruit in the mouth, then finishes with a pithy note.",US
7088,US,"Fruity and oaky, yet a little one-dimensional, this dry wine is sharply tart in acids, with an herbal, earthy note to the green apple and grapefruit juice flavors.",US
7089,US,"This elegant blend of stainless- and barrel-aged lots captures the fresh fruit flavors of red apples, kiwi and lime, letting just a hint of barrel toast creep into the finish. It's leesy and bracing, finished at 14.8% alcohol but tasting much lighter.",US
7090,US,"Dry and creamy, with peaches and cream, buttered toast and mineral flavors. The oak sticks out a little too much, and there's some bitterness that rich fare will help balance.",US
7091,US,"A beautiful, lush Chardonnay, made in the ripe California style. Rich and creamy, marked with brisk acidity, it shows wonderful flavors of pineapples, roasted marshmallows, buttered toast and vanilla, with a tart, spicy scour of lime. Brilliant and complex. The vineyards were a combination of Sierra Madre and Bien Nacido.",US
7092,US,"Shows amazingly ripe fruit, offering a blast of pineapple jam, apricot, tangerine, papaya and lime flavors. The acidity is crisp and tart, and the oak is rich and flamboyant, yet in keeping with the size of the underling wine. Super-rich and decadent, this Chardonnay is at its best soon.",US
7093,US,"Lots of exotic flavors in this barrel-fermented Chardonnay. Its deep in gold color, indicating richness and oak, and follows through with pineapples, mangos, tangerine sorbet, buttered toast, buttercotch, vanilla cream and cinnamon spice. Great price for a Chard this good.",US
7094,US,"Williams Selyem is now playing the unoaked game, and with their fruit sources, wow. Most winemakers would kill to put oak onto these grapes. The wine is tremendous in pineapples, pears, papayas and kiwi fruit. It's so rich, you won't even notice the absence of caramel and all those oaky influences.",US
7095,US,"It's common to complain that American oak isn't as good as French oak, but this wine disproves that. The wood shows up as rich in caramel, buttered toast and vanilla spice notes that provide a lovely counterpoint to the wine's grilled pineapple and lime fruit. This is a beautiful, interesting Chardonnay.",US
7096,US,"Here's a good everyday Chard, offering immediate pleasure in the ripe tropical fruit and peach flavors, creamy texture and smoky oak influence. It's a blend of Russian River and Alexander Valley.",US
7097,US,"Good price for a firm, steely Chardonnay that's elegant and dry through the finish. Minerals and citrus fruits mark it, with a Meyer lemon tartness given added richness from 25% new oak fermentation. Ready now.",US
7098,US,"Soft and sweet, although there's a lot going on, taste-wise. Flavors of pineapples, peaches, pears and vanilla are wrapped into an oaky, creamy package. But the wine would benefit from more acidity and less sweetness.",US
7099,US,"Good everyday Chard, a little minty, but rewards for its upfront pineapple pie, peaches and cream and vanilla smoke flavors. The tart acidity actually works to balance out the richness.",US
7100,US,"A good effort from New Jersey's Unionville, this delicate Chard offers harmonious flavors of tropical fruit and flowers, with a touch of spice to add complexity. Balanced acid keeps the wine clean and light.",US
7101,US,"The structure on this wine is just fine, with crisp, coastal acidity and low alcohol making for a clean, well-balanced Chard. Its weakness is in the thinness of flavor. The wine is watery, with mere traces of citrus fruits and peaches.",France
7102,US,"This soft, simple wine tastes more like Gewürztraminer than Chardonnay, with spice and wildflower notes to the apricots.",US
7103,US,"This is a hard and steely, with a sour lemon center and a vitamin finish. Perhaps with a great deal of airing it would fill in a bit, but there's not much going on.",US
7104,US,"Toasty oak cradles this wine, while flavors of yellow fruits shine through. The wine has a smooth, light body, with nice balance, and finishes crisp, with more oaky nuance.",US
7105,US,"Good and rich, but tastes too oaky, with the pineapple, nectarine and peach flavors swamped by vanilla, caramel and butterscotch. Other than that, there's a fine, crisp minerality to the finish.",US
7106,US,"Made in the popular style of oak-enhanced ripe fruit, this Chard shows flavors of pineapples, peaches and cream, buttered toast, buttered popcorn and cinnamon spice. It finishes a little sweet and simple.",US
7107,US,"Lives up to its reserve status, being the creamiest and most densely packed of Roche's several new Chardonnays. With brisk, bright acidity and ripe flavors of pineapples, Key lime pie and vanilla cream, its buttered toast and char flavors provide the perfect counterpoint from oak barrel aging.",US
7108,US,"Fragrant and lush with floral/citrus aromas, this stainless-fermented Chardonnay is inviting and seductive. Brilliant, bright fruit anchors a wine that is tense and dense and vividly thrilling. The acids are natural and flavors seamlessly run from lemon/lime to pineapple to orange, and keep on keeping on, with fresh, water-washed rock in the finish.",US
7109,US,"Lots of razzle-dazzle in this rich, opulent Chardonnay. Shows buttery, oak-inspired pear and pineapple flavors, with a leesy, creamy mouthfeel, and fine acidity to brighten and balance all that richness. Drink this decadent wine with lobster, scallops, crab or shrimp, or a great ahi tuna tartare with potato chips.",US
7110,US,"Very ripe and oaky, but a little on the obvious side, with flamboyant tropical fruit, honey and buttered toast flavors. Could use greater finesse, subtlety, complexity.",US
7111,US,"Soft and flabby, especially on the entry, without the acidity to balance the very ripe pineapple, guava and vanilla-oak flavors. A wine this flavorful desperately needs crispness.",US
7112,US,"Pretty thin in fruit, which makes the bare-bones alcohol, acids and oak stick out.",US
7113,US,"Basic Chard, if thin, with just enough peaches and cream, vanilla and toast flavors to satisfy.",US
7114,US,"Ripe in fruit and a bit soft and thick in texture, this is a decent country-style Chard that offers what consumers want: Peachy, tropical fruit flavors, oak notes and a creamy texture.",US
7115,US,"Shows all the qualities of a fine Edna Valley Chard, from the juicy acids to the laser pure lime and nectarine flavors. It's thinned down from the better stuff, but still, not bad.",US
7116,US,"A combination of Santa Maria and Santa Rita fruit, with the majority from Bien Nacido, this is a dry, crisp Chardonnay. It's more rustic than the Chards from Foley, the parent winery, but shows some interesting qualities.",France
7117,US,"Sharp and green, with a minty, chlorophyll taste. High acidity makes the finish searing.",US
7118,US,"There's not much, if any, oak on this Chardonnay, leaving the fresh, clean fruit flavors to star. Shows a rich array of pineapples, Meyer lemons, yellow apricots and peaches, with spicy, vanilla overtones. Elegant, and a good buy at this price.",US
7119,US,"Creamy and lightly toasty, this elegant Chardonnay mixes its melon/apple fruit with vanilla cream and toasted cracker. The acid feels natural and brings in suggestions of pineapple, with a nice smack of butter kicking out the finish.",US
7120,US,"This is an enomoursly rich Chardonnay that positively explodes in apricot jam, pineapple, vanilla custard and butterscotch flavors. It's balanced with crisp, cool-climate Carneros acidity that makes it tangy and clean. Easy to find, with 33,000 cases produced.",US
7121,US,"Frank rarely misses a mark and this wine is another example of the poised flavors one expects from this winery. The aromas are fresh but subtle, with a delicate spin of toasted oak. The wine offers a restrained and sophisticated profile that balances depth with a clean, measured use of oak.",US
7122,US,"Super-fruity in pineapples, peaches and sweet vanilla oak, with adequate acidity, this is a rich, forward Chardonnay to drink now with shellfish or mushroom risotto.",US
7123,US,"Rich and opulent, in the California coastal style. The grapes come from some respected Carneros vineyards, including Hyde and Stanly Ranch, and the pedigree shows in the balance of ripeness and acidity. With pineapple, mango, green apple, crème brûlée and buttered toast flavors, it's just delicious. Great with Dungeness crab and sourdough bread and butter.",US
7124,US,"Offering none of the oaky, fruity richness of popular Chardonnays, this bottle needs to be figured out in a different way. It's super-dry, acidic and minerally, with citrus fruit flavors that seem barely touched by oak. It's a wine of structural integrity, made in the style of a great Chablis. One of the rare Chardonnays that should age.",US
7125,US,"With a dash of oak for vanilla and crème brûlée seasoning, this is a very ripe, soft Chardonnay. The fruit flavors veer toward apricots and nectarines, and finish a bit sweet.",US
7126,US,"Soft, ripe and oaky, with flamboyant tropical fruit pastry flavors that are almost sugary sweet on the finish. There's good acidity to balance.",US
7127,US,"Oak sticks out on this Chardonnay, with the aroma and flavor of buttered white toast dominating. But there comes an immediate rush of pineapples, limes and peaches, giving the wine a good balance of wood and fruit, and it's very dry and crisp. At its best now, but don't serve too cold.",US
7128,US,"This is a bizarre wine. The alcohol is extremely high, and the fruit is enormously ripe, to the point of bananas. The wine will have its fans, but to me it's Chardonnay-Port, over-manipulated and over-stylized. Tasted twice.",France
7129,US,"Popcorn on the nose leads to citrus in the mouth, with a touch of oak. The wine verges on being tart, giving it a lively mouthfeel.",US
7130,US,"This wine is clean and well made, with a smooth mouthfeel. Oaky butter and vanilla aromas combine with watery flavors of pear and popcorn.",US
7131,US,"Smells of yellow Runts, with a brambly edge. Like the '04 Private Reserve Chardonnay, this wine doesn't lack in body, but the flavors are diminished. Salted yellow fruits die out quickly, leaving nothing behind.",US
7132,US,"The fruit is massive, succulent in pineapple custard, Key lime pie and roasted coconut, and the oak is also powerful in new, charred character. There there's the brilliant acidity that makes it all work.",US
7133,US,"This tiny-production, best-of-barrels bottling is  ncredibly rich, and not unlike grand cru Burgundy. There are similarities in the Baroque structure and complex, layered lemondrop flavors that new oak so flatters. There's a tight, minerally acidity; it's a little leesy-sour right now, and all the parts haven't come together, but for sheer dazzle, you can't beat it. Cellar until the end of 2006 and drink through 2008.",US
7134,US,"Dry and richly oaked, with ripe flavors, this is a big Chardonnay. It shows massive flavors of pineapple custard, pear jam, butterscotch, buttered toast and caramel. A bit direct, but a crowd pleaser.",US
7135,US,"Dry and balanced, just 25% of this went through malolactic, it shows crisp apple, pear and citrus brightened with punchy acids. Just a hint of oak from aging in 25% new barrels.",US
7136,US,"A good collection of fruit flavors bring interest to this surprisingly ripe Chardonnay. Pineapple, green apple and light tropical fruits are set against pleasing barrel flavors of baked pear and glazed doughnut (really!).",US
7137,US,"Vegetal and watery, a very dry wine that offers little in the way of fruit. Tastes like alcohol with a drop or two of grapefruit juice.",US
7138,US,"A very rich wine, courtesy of some Viognier and Pinot Gris, not to mention new oak. Offers flattering flavors of pineapples, golden mangoes, vanilla cream, buttered toast and honeysuckle flowers.",US
7139,US,"From estate fruit, this Chardonnay falls a bit flat in the mouth. The fruit is light and simple, and there is a hint of bitterness that leave a chemical aftertaste.",US
7140,US,"A bit quick on the finish, but otherwise a nice everyday Chardonnay. Shows a soft, buttercream texture, with dry, subtle flavors of pineapples, pears and buttered toast.",US
7141,US,"Good everyday Chard, with pronounced peach, apple and pear flavors and more exotic notes of tropical fruits. Oak adds the smoke, vanilla and cream that round the wine off.",US
7142,US,"Lots of oak, lots of upfront ripe peach, pear and tropical fruit, that's pretty much the story with this widely available Chard. With more than 100,000 cases, it should be easy to find.",US
7143,US,"This creamy Chard has good varietal character, with pleasant peach, green apple and cinnamon spice flavors.",US
7144,US,"Shows the dramatic structure of a fine coastal Chardonnay, with crisp acidity and a bracing minerality framing ripe, lush flavors of pineapples, tangerines, pears and sweet, caramelized oak. Very rich and fine, deserving of the best shellfish, salmon, ahi tuna.",US
7145,US,"This is a big, ripe, rich and oaky Chardonnay, the kind that will seduce lots of people with sheer dazzle, although only 135 cases were produced so it's likely to be hard to find. Dry and crisp, it's concentrated in pineapple tart and peach marmalade flavors, accented with plenty of sweet, smoky oak, and brightened with crisp Monterey acidity.",US
7146,US,"Has great weight and texture, with an unctuous, oily mouthfeel, and is crisp and dry. Almost like a great Chablis, with a tang of steel and minerals undergirding the limes, pineapples and wildflowers. The grapes are from the well-regarded Sierra Madre Vineyard.",US
7147,US,"A rich, brisk and complex Chardonnay that shows cool-climate structure and the ripe fruit that comes from a good vintage and great viticulture, in a difficult growing region. The pineapple, pear and golden mango flavors are enriched with lots of smoky, buttery oak, and offset with crisp acidity. Decadent and delicious.",US
7148,US,"This is not a very good Chardonnay. It's thin and simple, with syrupy flavors and a heavy hand of oak.",US
7149,US,"The underlying wine shows real Santa Barbara Chard character of crispness and ripe, juicy fruit, with flavors of pineapples and peaches. But a huge, major flaw is excessive oakiness. All that caramel and butterscotch throws this otherwise likeable wine out of balance.",US
7150,US,"Simple and gluey, with canned tangerine and apricot flavors and an unnatural oaky taste.",US
7151,US,"Syrupy, with candied apricot flavors and a sugary finish.",US
7152,US,"Great Chardonnay, exotically rich and complex. With the crisp, zesty acidity of Russian River in a cool vintage, the wine is impressively balanced despite its powerhouse flavors. Pineapples, mangoes, papayas, new oak, minerals and Asian spices mingle together, leading to a long finish.",US
7153,US,"Los Alamos is a Santa Barbara region that should have its own appellation, to judge by this and many other wines grown there. A cool place, it has given this Chardonnay brilliantly crisp acidity, while ripening the fruit to perfection. Apricots, peaches, pears and mangoes are the primary flavors, enhanced with rich, toasty oak.",US
7154,US,"This wine starts out so acidic, it's almost sour. Then the intense lemondrop flavors kick in, followed by the lush vanilla-accented smoky new oak, and the chalky minerals on the finish, and suddenly, the acidity makes sense. It's Chablisian, built for the cellar. By sometime in 2008, everything should start to meld together, and this block selection could do amazing things over the next four to six years.",US
7155,US,"This wine comes down on the earthy side, with a dried herb note to the apple, peach and fig flavors. It's very dry, with decent acidity. Finishes with a vanilla flourish.",US
7156,US,"Simple and fruity, with peach and pear flavors that finish with spicy oak, this Chard is fully dry. It has a bracing acidity that provides balance.",US
7157,US,"The aromas and flavors of dill overpower the underlying fruit here, almost masking the citrus, pear and peach flavors. This may be due to oak or something else, but it's offputting. Too bad, because somewhere in here is a very fine Chardonnay.",US
7158,US,"Richly creamy, the flavors suggest dried peaches and mangoes and a buttery, vanilla-rich pineapple crème brûlée, with a complex spicebox finish.",US
7159,US,"From the coolest part of Green Valley, this wonderfully rich Chardonnay has a steely crispness that hits the palate like a laser. The pineapple, apple, kiwi and lime flavors, enhanced with smoky oak, are complex and satisfying. This is a high-class wine that deserves to be served with gourmet fare.",US
7160,US,"Takes the firm, flinty steeliness and tangy acidity of Edna Valley fruit to new heights, with powerful yet nuanced Key lime, kiwi and tart green apple flavors and a rich, creamy, not-too-oaky mouthfeel.",France
7161,US,"As good as Clos Pegase's 2003 regular Chardonnay was, this is richer, more complex and more satisfying. It's an oaky wine, with buttered toast and caramel layers on top of tropical fruit flavors. Somehow, acidity pulls it all together, and the wine is balanced. Best now through 2007.",US
7162,US,"The winery's reserve Chard has a richly satisfying buttercream texture that frames ripe flavors of limes, peaches and pinepapples, ending in a spicy, honeyed finish. Crisp acidity makes the wine bright and clean.",US
7163,US,"Dobles lías, “double lees,” tells you this is a leesy wine, and that slight sour-creamy flavor dominates. This is a wine you love or don't. I find it refreshingly dry and complex, not a fruit bomb, but a dry, elegant Chard, in which new French oak adds enriching notes.",US
7164,US,"Nothing subtle about this big, ripe, oaky Chardonnay. It shows the tropical fruit richness of a fine Alexander Valley Chard, flamboyant in pineapple custard flavor, with a flinty minerality. The sweet overlay of smoky oak is perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume.",US
7165,US,"Exciting, fresh and full of spicy, toasted undertones, this wine immediately calls for a food pairing of a richer seafood (think oysters, crab) or poultry. The flavors are balanced and buoyed by crispness, but the wine still offers complexity and a lingering finish.",US
7166,US,"A racy, citric undertone and spicy toast beckon on this fun, fresh wine from New York. On the palate, there's an impressive roundness and a touch of butter on the tongue, but a very pretty wave of flowers, minerality and zip keep it light.",US
7167,US,"Much the same as the winery's Pinot Gris, this unoaked Chardonnay has very green fruit flavors—tart crunchy green apple with plenty of acidity.",France
7168,US,"To this taster, there's so much high-char new oak on this Chard that it goes beyond toast all the way to burnt ash. Too bad, because the underlying wine is crisp and ripe in polished tropical fruit.",US
7169,US,"One hundred percent new French oak is the dominant theme here. It floods the mouth with the flavors of buttered toast and vanilla. The oak influence is strong, but the underlying wine has some equally strong pineapple, mango and apple fruit. It's made in a rich California style you either love or hate.",US
7170,US,"All the buttered toast, vanilla bean, apricot jam and pineapple crème brûlée you could want is here, but this lovely Chardonnay is lifted above the ordinary by a minerality that gives it a refreshing tang. Crisp acidity also helps to provide structure to the richness. Will have a short life as evidenced by some overripeness on the finish, so enjoy now.",US
7171,US,"Nasty and sharp, with candied LifeSaver flavors that have a weirdly medicinal, over-oaked taste.",US
7172,US,"This is a distinctive Chardonnay, with pea vine and peach, anise and apple mixing it up. It has a lovely, lifted elegance that keeps the flavors intertwined but allows you to experience them separately as well, and it carves a flavor trail through the finish that lingers sensuously. Could be the best CV Chardonnay ever from L'Ecole.",US
7173,US,"This is one of the biggest, richest Chardonnays that Rodney Strong has ever produced, and no wonder, as longtime winemaker Rick Sayre was assisted by David Ramey as a consultant. The wine has Ramey-esque proportions, gigantic in fleshy tropical fruit, caramel, vanilla cream, butterscotch and meringue flavors. It's so softly decadent, it's almost better as a cocktail wine than with food.",US
7174,US,"Baileyana's Pinot Noirs from the cool Edna Valley are right up there with the best, and so is their Chardonnay. It shows off the region's typically bright acidity and pure, clean flavors of limes, kiwis and Asian pears, undergirded with a vibrant minerality.",US
7175,US,"Impressive for the enormous depth and range of the fruit, which is a blast of pineapple custard, kiwi, Key lime pie, and the ripest, sweetest white peach, all of it coated in fine, toasty oak. This is a big Chardonnay that calls for rich fare, like lobster.",US
7176,US,"Shows the softness and earthy, herbal character that mark so many Napa Chards. Good new French oak adds flash, and you'll find some nice peach and pear custard flavors, but the wine wants more zest.",US
7177,US,"Earthy, like some Napa Chards, with a sage and thyme edge to the pear and peach fruit. The wine also is a little soft. But there's an interesting minerality. Could develop bottle complexity over the next few years.",US
7178,US,"A round, full character with ample layers of creamy spice and balanced acid recommend this elegant, more traditional Chardonnay from the Finger Lakes. The mouthfeel is full but poised, and the finish long.",US
7179,US,"This is a bit fat and forward, with flavors of tropical fruit and banana, and a light dusting of cocoa, cinnamon and butterscotch. It's a tasty wine to drink up as soon as possible.",US
7180,US,"Opens with peach and apricot aromas, then turns fruity and simple, with a dryish, creamy mouthfeel.",US
7181,US,"Released unusually at the age of nearly five years, this Chardonnay is losing its primary fruit. It's developing a toasted cashew and hazelnut character, and the pineapples are transmogrifying to chewy dried fruits and even Christmas fruitcake. Meanwhile the sweet, caramelized oak is fully integrated. Bravo to the winery for holding this back and letting us see what an older Sonoma Coast Chardonay does.",US
7182,US,"A very interesting Chardonnay, and easily worth the price. It was fermented in 50% new French oak, which gives it a creamy, smoky richness, while the underlying fruit flavors are ripe and rewarding, suggesting pineapples, Asian pears, green apples and Meyer lemons. A beautiful, complex and balanced wine.",US
7183,US,"Made in the modern, ripe California style of exceptionally ripe fruit, accented with strong oak. Not especially subtle, but flattering to the palate, with opulent flavors of pineapple crème brûlée, peaches, cream, buttered toast, vanilla bean and honeysuckle.",US
7184,US,"Here's a really good Chardonnay: Crisp, delicate and dry, it shows great acidity and brilliant fruit, saturating the palate with pineapple tart, Key lime pie, vanilla cream, crème brûlée and cinnamon spice flavors. Finishes with the deliciously creamy, yeasty complexities of lees aging.",US
7185,US,"Dry and crisp in acidity, with butterscotchy new oak notes that frame flavors of apricots, lychee, pineapple, pear and papaya. Drink this delicious Chardonnay now.",US
7186,US,"This elaborate wine totally satisfies for its rich, creamy texture and forward pineapple custard, kiwi, honeydew and tangerine flavors. As if that weren't enough, toasty new oak carries it over the finish line. Dry and balanced, lots of quality here for the price.",US
7187,US,"What a nice wine this is, fruity and wonderfully bright and crisp in citrus acidity. It doesn't taste very oaky, despite barrel fermentation, and that allows those pure Monterey peach, lime, apricot and papaya flavors to shine.",US
7188,US,"A little sweet, a little rustic, with big, forward pear, apricot and peaches and cream flavors and a scrubbing of good acidity.",US
7189,US,"You'll find some peach and apple flavors in this wine, but they're rather watery, and the wine lacks the acidity to make it bright, like those Australian and New Zealand unoaked Chards. It's not bad, just an underachiever.",US
7190,US,"This is a good example of what Finger Lakes Chards can offer: assertive, full-flavored Chardonnay flavors and layers of spice edged by a clean minerality. Balanced and offering a supple mouthfeel, the wine is both food friendly and elegant.",US
7191,US,"Luscious fruit and toast aromas are the beginning of this fun wine from Fox Run. On the palate, it offers good Chardonnay flavors and a round, supple mouthfeel. It's not terribly complex but is flavorful and has dimension.",US
7192,US,"Clean enough, but not much going on in this dry, thin Chard. It has watery, vaguely Chardonnay-like flavors and is acidic.",US
7193,US,"This is all Birch Creek vineyard fruit, barrel fermented and put through full malolactic. It's soft, fleshy and buttery, with good ripe light tropical fruit, lots of barrel flavor, and enough acid to support it all. Both Rulo Chardonnays are perfect expressions of their style—one oaked, one unoaked—each in fine balance and proportion.",US
7194,US,"Shows the slight tug of herbaceousness that often marks Carneros/Napa Chardonnays. But it's very dry and crisp, and there's a minerality that helps this lemon- and lime-flavored wine pair cleanly with shellfish, salmon or just a good roast chicken.",US
7195,US,"A very nice Chardonnay that's dry and crisp and elegant. Shows tart, leesy flavors of citrus fruits, apricots and pears, with a steely minerality that may come from those famous Livermore rocks. Great price for a Chardonnay of this quality.",US
7196,US,"The coolness of the site and the vintage has yielded a young, tart wine that fans of big, fat Chards might find lean and austere. But it's a grand wine for Burgundy lovers. Acidity is high, and there's a stony minerality undergirding the citrus, wildflower and smoky oak flavors. This is one of those rare Chards that needs some time to come around. Best 2008–2011.",US
7197,US,"Like the winery's other 2005 Chardonnays, this one, tasted in March, is tightly wound and minerally. The aroma will show little if the wine is too cold. Flavor-wise, hints of tart tangerines, lemongrass, green apples, candied ginger and vanilla cream swirl into a smoky oak, spicy finish. This is a Chardonnay that needs some time in the bottle. Drink now and for a couple of years.",US
7198,US,"Charry, smoky oak stars in this young, well-structured wine, leading to powerhouse peach pie (with the crust), lemon mousse and buttered toast flavors that finish long and spicy. Acidity is high, and gives a tangy minerality that adds complexity.",US
7199,US,"Concentrated, beautifully defined flavors of pear, apple and ripe pineapple drive a stake through the heart of this wine, blazing a trail across the palate with tongue-thrashing acids and bracing minerality. As it slowly unwinds it reveals a finish of banana caramel tart, luscious and long.",US
7200,US,"Shows the softness of Alexander Valley Chardonnay, and the delicious complexity that these wines can attain. Apricots, pineapples, peaches and Meyer lemons are the fruits, framed by vanilla and smoke from new oak, and finishing with a minerality that must come from the earth.",US
7201,US,"Offers a good modern interpretation of Chardonnay, with its ripe, oaky flavors and creamy texture. Grilled pineapples, mashed green pears, buttered toast, caramel and vanilla, brightened with crisp acidity.",US
7202,US,"From a vineyard that has a long track record of success with Chardonnay, this new entry is a bit sharp and toasty, perhaps just a bit young to be at its peak. The fruit flavors are light and bring green apple and melon into play; the oak tastes new and not yet well-integrated, but with time this should balance out.",US
7203,US,"Sharp and crisp in citrusy acidity, this Chard has jammy flavors of apricots, pineapples and vanilla oak. A little direct, but dry and creamy, and easy to drink.",US
7204,US,"Chardonnay from Napa mountains? Yes. The wine is tightly packed and nervy, as far from a fat, opulent Chard as you can imagine. Thoroughly dry, with a minerality behind the citrus flavors, which suggests aging in a cool cellar for a good decade.",US
7205,US,"That terrific Santa Rita acidity is there, and the oak regimen tastes very expensive, but the fruit doesn't seem up to the task. It's a pretty good wine, with pineapples, dates, crème brûlée and spices, but there should be greater richness and complexity from this esteemed vineyard.",US
7206,US,"Pronounced minerality and fresh, bright fruit are balanced nicely in this stylish wine. A touch of spice adds dimension. Pair with poultry dishes.",US
7207,US,"It's all upfront in this direct Chard, with ripe pineapple, yellow apricot and passionfruit flavors that have been generously oaked. Will satisfy fans of big, lush California Chards. Drink now.",US
7208,US,"Frog's Leap's Chards always have a softly herbal earthiness, even though there's plenty of pineapple, green apple, apricot and vanilla oaky flavor. That herbaceousness keeps the wine from soaring.",US
7209,US,"An acidic, bone-dry Chardonnay, brilliant in fruit, that doesn't seem to have been touched by oak. It's so pure in zesty Meyer lemon, lime and kiwi flavors, with a mouthwateringy clean finish.",US
7210,US,"Despite oak-infused pineapple and mango flavors this Chardonnay is a bit brittle and tart, with an acidic sharpness all the way through. Drink up.",US
7211,US,"Weak and vegetal, with just the barest note of Chardonnay juice, this is a pretty forgettable wine.",US
7212,US,"What a roll St. Jean has been on with Chardonnay. This wine was made from a majority of Robert Young and Belle Terre vineyard fruit, and is two-thirds new French oak. The combination is mind-blowing. The vineyards contribute concentrated spicy, tropical fruit flavors and perfect acid balance, while the oak provides elaborate seasoning. Absolutely delicious. One of the most satisfying Chards of the vintage.",US
7213,US,"This year's Rosemary's is dry, crisp in citrusy acids, and wonderfully complex. It shows fresh, sweet pineapple fruit and spicy overtones of cinnamon and nutmeg along with layers of minerals and dried herbs. Easily takes its place in the front ranks of California Chardonnay.",US
7214,US,"Acidity and minerals are the hallmarks of this exciting Chardonnay. Of course, you'll find the ripe tropical fruit and new oak and lees of other Chardonnays, but it's really that tanginess that attracts. Currently the wine shows primary flavors of mangoes and papayas, but it would not surprise me if it ages well beyond five years.",US
7215,US,"Absolutely beautiful, one of the best unoaked Chardonnays on the market. Brims with bright, clean flavors of pineapples, limes and kiwis, along with vanilla and a touch of cinnamon spice. With its brisk scour of acidity, it's a super-drinkable wine.",US
7216,US,"A nice, lush Chardonnay. It lacks a bit of exciting structure, and depends too much on sheer dazzle. But it sure is rich in toasty oak-inspired pineapples, peaches, pears and limes. Good now with grilled shrimp.",US
7217,US,"Shows lots of dryness and austerity, with acidity, minerals and herbs accompanying the citrus and oak flavors. Not a flamboyant Chardonnay, but a controlled one that offers complexity. A good companion to fresh crab, with buttery garlic bread.",US
7218,US,"No oak to interfere with the ripe, opulent flavors of pineapples, lemons, limes and tangerines, which are brightened and heightened by crisp acidity. The price is right on this balanced, savory Chardonnay.",US
7219,US,"Right now my preference between Mondavi's Reserve and regular Chard is the regular. This is a better wine, from a classic Chablisian point of view, but it needs time. It's firm and deep in fruit, with an impressive minerality, and the balance for aging. Lay this Chardonnay down for two to four years as it gains some bottle complexity.",France
7220,US,"This is a bold, oaky Chardonnay. Toasty roasted-nut aromas lead the charge, followed by hints of peach and melon, while a strong vanilla component comes forward on the palate. Finishes warm, with prominent oak spice.",US
7221,US,"A very nice Chardonnay that continues the winery's success with this bottling. Dry and creamy, it has rich flavors of pineapples, pears, vanilla and spices.",US
7222,US,"Last year, I wrote of this wine that it's firm in acids and minerals, with apple, citrus and peach flavors and a clean, streamlined finish. The same goes for the '04. It's a totally dry, elegantly steely wine that won't compete with fancy fish or poultry dishes.",US
7223,US,"Barrel fermented and aged on the lees for almost a year, this is a nutty, slightly oily wine that shows the influence of the barrel, but lacks the fruit density to match it. The 14% alcohol hits the palate with some heat. High-toned and a bit harsh.",US
7224,US,"A very appealing nose of earthy spice starts this successful Chard, and leads into a full, rounded blanket of toasted oak and fruit. There's complexity here without heaviness, and the wine finishes big but pretty. Pair with richer seafood—like crab—or creamy poultry dishes.",US
7225,US,"This is rich and fruity and direct. It appeals for its acid-laced lime, kiwi, passionfruit and pineapple flavors and rich, smoky coat of oak.",US
7226,US,"Fruity and direct, an easy-drinking Chardonnay. Brims with pineapples, pears and peaches, with an off-dry, honeyed finish.",US
7227,US,A common or garden variety Chardonnay whose flamboyant caramelized oak flavors dominate the pineapples and limes.,US
7228,US,"Another great RSR. A bit soft, but that's okay, as the pineapple custard, white peach and vanilla-oak flavors are perked up by bright citron and Meyer lemon. The finish is pure honey, rich and long and spicy. Such a complex wine.",US
7229,US,"A bit overt in oak, with vanilla and buttered toast aromas and flavors dominating. But you'll also find rich, flamboyant notes of pineapples, kiwi fruit and limes. Fancy and elegant, with broad restaurant appeal.",US
7230,US,"Pretty oaky, with a flood of caramel and buttered toast, and you have to wonder why they plastered so much barrel influence, because the underlying wine is pretty good. Buried under the wood is a dry, crisp Chardonnay with pineapple, pear, floral and mineral flavors. Give it a good decant and don't serve too cold.",US
7231,US,"A bit heavy on the oak, with vanilla, caramel and buttered toast aromas and flavors. But the pineapple and apple fruit is nice and ripe, and the finish is rich in spicy honey.",US
7232,US,"Silky and crisp, with those long, penetrating Edna Valley flavors of ripe kiwis, Key lime pie and intense vanilla. Shows real elegance and flair, and this is a good price for the quality.",US
7233,US,"There's a lot of crisp, vibrant acidity in this wine, which gives the pineapple, apricot and peach flavors a jamminess that lasts through the finish. With its creamy texture, it's a wine to drink now.",US
7234,US,"This is a very dry, tart Chardonnay, almost like a Fumé Blanc except that it's richer and creamier. The flavors are of lemons and limes, and papayas that aren't quite ripe. It's a complex wine that will pick up interest as it warms up and plays against food.",US
7235,US,"Sebastiani reaches to the Russian River Valley Duttons for this rich, crisp and complex Chardonnay. It displays classic cool-climate acidity that makes the tropical fruit flavors sing, while oak adds intriguing smoke, vanilla and woodspice notes.",US
7236,US,"Not quite as rich or complex as the Reserve, but close on its heels, with well-ripened tropical fruit flavors accented by spicy, toasty oak. This is a classic California cool-climate Chard, with bright, zesty acidity.",US
7237,US,"A light floral and toasty nose leads into this clean, slightly racy Chardonnay from New York. There's a touch of sweetness to the wine but it's balanced by good oak and an earthiness to the finish.",US
7238,US,"For lovers of the big California Chardonnays, this wine delivers. Bold aromas of buttery spice lead into full flavors of cream, butter and spice. The wine offers complexity and unfolds nicely on the palate. A white that can handle rich dishes and can age.",US
7239,US,"Here's a likeable Chard, with peach, pear and fig flavors that have a distinctly herbal edge, like dried sage. Turns buttery and vanilla-y on the finish.",US
7240,US,"A little too ripe and oaky for elegance, this is almost dessert-like, in the sweet vanilla, crème brûlée and pineapple jam flavors. Crisp acidity helps to balance.",US
7241,US,"Fresh toast, wooded spice  on the nose is friendly and appealing. On the palate, it works too, with its playful balance of layered spice oak and fresh acidity. The wine will appeal to fans of both oaked and unoaked Chardonnay, and will make a nice addition to the table.",France
7242,US,"Hints of tropical fresh fuit and flowers lends an exotic touch to this pretty wine, and on the palate, it offers balanced elements of crisp fruit and spicy oak. Not terribly complex but a friendly food wine.",US
7243,US,"Layers of round, appealing Chardonnay aromas lead into this nicely balanced offering from New York. Earthy spice and good acidity give the wine both complexity and elegance, and the finish is lengthy. A good wine for solo sips or pairing with poultry and fish.",US
7244,US,"Shows the creamy texture of Chardonnay, with the sweet-and-sour pineapple flavor of a Chinese food sauce.",US
7245,US,"Tough in acidity, with less than ripe tobacco and herb flavors, this bone-dry Chardonnay isn't offering much richness.",US
7246,US,Way too oaky. The underlying fruit is not nearly strong enough to support all that caramel and buttered toast. The result is clumsy.,US
7247,US,"Tastes semi-sweet and acidic, like a Lifesaver candy, with apricot and herb flavors. Awkward.",US
7248,US,"A distinctive Chardonnay made in the Farrell style, which leans toward acidic and elegant. But this is not an austere wine, far from it. It has a rich minerality and flavors of lime and pineapple custard, and then an even richer crème brûlée finish. Delicious and complex.",US
7249,US,"A lean, steely and slightly herbaceous Chardonnay, whose brisk elegance makes up for the absence of richness. This Chablis-style wine is marked by minerals and suggestions of lemons and limes, as well as strong acidity. Calls for fresh crab in the shell, with plenty of drawn butter for dipping.",US
7250,US,"Stainless steel fermented, this pure varietal is bursting with a tasty fruit bowl mix of apple, pineapple, and Meyer lemon. A hint of mint sneaks in, and the acidity brings bracing minerality to the finish.",US
7251,US,"Give this youthful wine some time to settle down. Tasted in late March, its parts had yet to mesh. The acidity, oakiness and fresh grapy flavors are at some odds with each other. By winter of 2007, it should be a fine, complex Chardonnay, and drink well for five years.",US
7252,US,"Ripeness of fruit characterizes this Chardonnay. It brims with pineapple tart, green apple, vanilla, meringue, buttercream and cinnamon flavors, with a good cut of acidity.",US
7253,US,"Strong and ripe and oaky. Not showing much subtlety, but a very good example of the modern California style. It's a clean, vibrant Chardonnay starring massive flavors of pineapple tart, Meyer lemon custard and tangerines, brightened with zesty acidity.",US
7254,US,"A brisk, clean Chardonnay with a firm footing of minerals undergirding polished pineapple, pear and cedar flavors. Offers lots of sophisticated pleasure at a good price.",US
7255,US,"White Oak has done a good job with Chard over the years, and this fruit-forward bottling offers lots of pleasure. Apples, peaches, kiwis and limes star in this crisply tart, dry wine, which is only lightly oaked.",US
7256,US,"Like all Edna Valley Chards, this bottling is bone dry, with high acidity. The flavors are very citrusy, with richer notes of honeydew melon and sweet, oaky vanilla. This is a polished, elegant wine.",US
7257,US,"Brilliant exposition of Chardonnay from a cool climate. There's a brisk, clean, minerally moutheel, brimming with acidity, that frames exotic flavors of ripe tropical fruits, spices, peaches and vanilla-infused cream, and a finish that turns to pure apricot nectar. Just delicious.",US
7258,US,"Here's a big, rich, mouthfilling Chard. It's superoaky, superripe and just delicious, offering up a wealth of mango, guava, pineapple custard and peach pie fruit, with the crème brûlée, buttercream and buttered toast from new oak. Really good Chardonnay.",US
7259,US,"At first pass, this feels a little tired, with a somewhat feeble nose and flavors that could tend toward bitter. But in the mouth, the wine impresses—the fruit is pretty and round, the mouthfeel smooth. Spice and fruit come together nicely and chase away any austerity that may be lurking. The finish is good and layered.",US
7260,US,"From giant Brown-Forman, it's a lip-smackingly fruity Chard, bigtime in pineapple, vanilla and smoky caramel flavors, with a sweet, honeyed finish.",US
7261,US,"With this wine's slightly rustic character, it makes it a slightly harder Chardonnay to love, but interesting notes of spice add interest. The wine lacks some dimension but overall, offers pretty flavors and a food-friendly minerality.",US
7262,US,"All the oaky, leesy richness is there, with buttered toast, crème brûlée and smoky buttercream, and tons of fruity ripeness, with a blast of Meyer lemon, pineapple, white peach and apricot. Yet there's also a firm, steely minerality, and, despite the dryness, maybe even a delicious touch of botrytis. The acidity is mouthwatering.",US
7263,US,"A massively constructed Chardonnay that's opulent and concentrated and bursts in the mouth with pineapple, lemon drop candy, Asian pear and white peach flavors of enormous ripeness. The entire production of 108 cases was aged in new oak, so there's a lavish veneer of sweet, smoky buttered toast. Sur lie aging is evident in the creaminess and ever so slight sourdough tartness that adds a piquant touch. This impressive Chard is at its best now in its flashy, flamboyant youth.",US
7264,US,"Chards are tight, acidic and minerally in youth, showing a lees-infused structure but offering waves of complexity. With toasty oak, the base flavors are of nectarines, mangoes, peaches, zesty green apples and dustings of Asian spice.",US
7265,US,"Well oaked, with a toasty, vanilla-infused cream and caramel edge, this polished Chard has peach custard flavors dusted with cinnamon, nutmeg and candied ginger. It's delicious and complex. The word “rich” doesn't begin to do it justice.",US
7266,US,"Inviting, fresh, racy scents mix pineapple, citrus and light tropical fruits. There is an interesting mouthfeel not unlike Sémillon, though none is indicated in the blend. The wine has substantial length and unusual highlights of spice, clove and mint, along with plenty of rich, ripe fruit to hold down the center palate. Not shy at 14.8% alcohol, this is a fine effort from consulting winemaker Charlie Hoppes.",US
7267,US,"Good price for an upscale Chardonnay this rich and interesting. It's oaky, with vanilla and buttered toast flavors, but the underlying pineapple and Meyer lemon fruit easily supports the wood, while brisk, refreshing acidity provides balance.",US
7268,US,"A flamboyant Chardonnay. Shows flashy scents of vanilla and buttered toast from oak, riding high over pineapple, pear, golden mango and nectarine fruit. Crisp acidity provides needed balance to the richness. Good price for the quality.",US
7269,US,"A dry, streamlined wine, for those who don't like super-fruity, oaky ones. With a streak of minerals, it shows an elegant structure framing citrus, melon and peach flavors.",US
7270,US,"Nice, dry and complex, a crisp wine with quite a bit of minerality undergirding the fruit and oak. Feels fine and balanced in the mouth, and should take a couple years in the cellar.",US
7271,US,"Shows the dry earthiness that often marks Carneros Chardonnay, with an herb and tobacco grounding to the riper pineapples and peaches. Oak, of course, adds sweet notes of vanilla and buttercream. There's also a cut of acidity.",US
7272,US,"This feels just a little bit thin, with a yeasty/beery character. Highlights of lemon oil and orange peel ripple through, into a finish with a suggestion of heat. Further bottle age might improve the score.",US
7273,US,"This is the oldest of the Milbrandt vineyards, planted in 1997. Though a bit riper than the Evergreen vineyard bottling, this Chardonnay feels lighter, with less density. It's balanced and complete, and the flavors of green apple and Asian pear offer a fine rendition of well-ripened Washington fruit.",US
7274,US,"Fans of acidity will like this wine for its bright crispness that really gets  the tastebuds whistling. It's a very dry, streamlined wine, with citrus zest and vanilla flavors that will play well off a nice cracked crab and sourdough baguette.",US
7275,US,"The vintage was very kind to Chardonnay, and the balance shows in the fantastically ripe, exotic pineapple tart, lemondrop candy, buttered toast, sandalwood and sweet, dusty spice flavors of this immaculately dry, crisp wine. It's strong and impressive now, and not particularly subtle, but should have a narrow window of near perfection. 2011–2013.",US
7276,US,"A clean, classic minerality leads on this unique and food-friendly Chardonnay. On the palate, fresh fruit flavors mingle with a touch of oak, and the finish offers both length and character.",US
7277,US,"A soft, feminine nose of toasted oak and round fruit on the nose, and a flavor profile of balanced fruit and acid on the palate, make this a good white for both cold weather, serious meals and just sipping on the patio in warmer months. The mouthfeel is a touch light and the wine could use some weight, but overall, a good choice for numerous dishes.",US
7278,US,"New oak seems to dominate this Chard, swamping the actual flavor of the wine. The grapes provide lovely apricots and pineapples, balanced with fine acidity, but the oak swamps with smoke and vanilla and sappy wood cream.",US
7279,US,"A little thin and herbal, but shows enough Chard character to accompany good shellfish or a chicken or veal dish. Modestly oaked, the wine has peach, tangerine, buttercream and smoky flavors.",US
7280,US,"Here's an everyday, country-style Chardonnay with good enough flavors of tropical fruits and smoky vanilla oak, and a nicely creamy texture, to satisfy.",US
7281,US,"Creamy fresh white fruit and toast on the nose hint at a fullness that the wine does not quite deliver on the palate, but overall the fruit is good. This tends toward tart and needs the balance of more oak to cut the edge.",US
7282,US,"It's a mystery how, in such a hot vintage, Talley produced this dry, minerally, almost austere Chardonnay. When everyone else was getting mangoes, this wine shows flint along with lime zest and kiwi. Yet the mark of Rincon Chard always has been a steely stoniness. The oak regime is big, but the wine handles it with aplomb. Best now through 2008.",US
7283,US,"The best Paraiso Chard I've ever had, this inaugural wine, a low-production block release, is tight and firm. Acidity, minerals and lees star. But there's also a tremendous core of ripe tropical fruits, roasted hazelnut, marzipan, coconut macaroon and all sorts of interesting things. Cellar it for a while, then drink from 2007–2010.",US
7284,US,"What a great job Tolosa has been doing with Chard, and it's all about that Edna Valley terroir. The fruit develops powerful kiwi and lime flavors, which are generously enriched with caramelly oak. Meanwhile, the climate preserves vital acidity. It's a perfect marriage.",US
7285,US,"This is one of those Chards that's more Burgundian than Californian. There's a rich earthiness followed by a minerally date nut, dried pineapple and spiced apple character. In the end, there's enough acidity to suggest mid-term aging.",US
7286,US,"Here's a polished, delicate wine that shows the poise and elegance that Carneros Chard can achieve. It's varietally pure, with pineapple, mineral and toast flavors that finish dry, a wine meant to enjoy with food, rather than star on its own. Easy to find, with 31,000 cases produced.",US
7287,US,"They didn't let any malolactic fermentation into this wine, a wise decision because you wouldn't want it to be any softer. Still, there's a prettiness to the ripe green apple, honey and toast flavors, which are complexed with layers of tropical fruits, spices and lees.",US
7288,US,"Enormously rich in pineapple jam, crème brûlée, buttercream, toast and cinnamon spice flavors, this wine's richness is balanced with crisp, citrusy acidity. It offers direct appeal now.",US
7289,US,"This is a blend of several vineyards, instead of the winery's usual single-vineyard Chards. It's been tastefully assembled, and displays good Central Coast acidity framing tropical fruit and oak flavors with a stony, minerally edge.",US
7290,US,"Rich and flamboyant in ultraripe pineapple jam, butterscotch and vanilla flavors, this Chard leaves little to the imagination. It has direct appeal for deliciousness.",US
7291,US,"Fruity and forward, with jammy apricot, pear, pineapple and vanilla cream flavors, girded with a tang of minerals. Grown on the Sonoma side of Carneros.",US
7292,US,"Soft and buttery, this is thickly flavored with caramel, traces of pineapple, and loads of rich, tropical fruit. It's big, delicious, spicy, round and full, and it resonates nicely if you give it a little chill before pouring, to sharpen up the acids. Distinctive and appealing, as are all Dunham wines.",US
7293,US,"Quite a good Chardonnay, made from Freestone's vineyards in the chilly southwestern part of the appellation, where coastal winds sweep in. Acidity and minerality give structure to the pineapple, honeysuckle, crème brûlée and buttered toast flavors. Drink this elegant wine now with upscale fare.",US
7294,US,"A rush of zippy, fresh fruit and spice aromas recommends this white from New York, offering the kind of clean fruit flavors and minerality that makes this region unique. The wine lacks real complexity and tends toward the austere but the beguiling spice saves the day.",US
7295,US,"A deep golden color and classic Chardonnay fruit and spice aromas, albeit with a touch of sweetness, begin this wine. On the palate, the fruit is fresh and good but lacks the layering and grounding that oak should offer. Overall it's a good everyday wine that just needs a touch of class to round out the rough edges; food may be the key.",US
7296,US,"This Chardonnay is creamy and scented with vanilla, ripe apple and pineapple. The fruit has a slightly overripe quality, a suggestion of funk on the finish, and the vanilla seems artificial. It says unoaked, but that's a lot of vanilla nonetheless.",US
7297,US,"A subtle nose of butter and spice leads this wine whose flavors are varietally correct but not terribly inspired. The fruit is balanced and round but the finish slightly watery. Not a bad everyday sip, but needs complexity.",US
7298,US,"What's so nice about this wine is that it has full-throttle Chard personality while keeping everything so balanced that it's also a versatile food wine. You can't say that about a lot of Chardonnays. Mainly it's the acidity, but also the complex, subtle interplay of fruit and oak. A very nice job.",US
7299,US,"This is a tightly wound Chardonnay, crisp and steely. It's also oaky. The underlying flavors are of citrus and tropical fruits, buttered toast and vanilla, with a touch of metallic stone. Calls to mind the 2006. Give it a breath of air before serving to soften it, and don't drink it too cold.",US
7300,US,"Fresh and vibrant, with crisp acidity brightening pineapple, golden apricot, lime and pear flavors. There's a bit of oak, but the fruit really stars in this savory young Chard.",US
7301,US,"From this large vineyard in the heart of the appellation comes this tight, young Chard. It's high in acidity, creating a tart mouthfeel containing mineral, Meyer lemon, green apple, apricot, kiwi and oak flavors. Don't drink it too cold, because it grows more complex as it warms in the glass.",US
7302,US,"Tighter and more citrusy than the regular Chardonnay, with the oak coming across as more restrained, although the proportion of new wood is undoubtedly higher. It's a subtly nutty, textural wine, with apple and lemon notes that linger on the finish.",US
7303,US,"Notable for high, stimulating acidity and purity of flavor, this lovely Chard brims with lime, mineral, white peach and apricot flavors, wrapped into a lush, creamy texture. It's an elegant, classy wine that improves as it breathes in the glass.",US
7304,US,"A very nice Chardonnay that has the dusty, herbal tug that Napa Chards often display. Otherwise it's very rich, with potent pineapple pie and peach tart flavors, enriched with creamy lees and buttery new oak. Drink now–2012.",US
7305,US,"Very dry, a lean, austere Chardonnay currently marked by aloof flavors of lemons, limes and oak. Yet there's something going on. As the wine warms in the glass it becomes richer, showing hidden pineapple tart, macadamia and crème brûlée. Firm, minerally acidity is there throughout, making for a mouthwatering cleanliness. Drink this streamlined, Chablis-like wine now–2013.",US
7306,US,"A nose of clean citrus and spice leads on this simple but likeable Chardonnay. On the palate, it offers more of the fresh flavors and the finish is crisp. A nice wine with seafood and salad, and a good choice for fans of lively whites.",US
7307,US,"A fresh, fruity nose with hints of spice lend an alluring start to this Chardonnay, but on the palate, flavors run a little thin.  That said, an appealing toasted oak spice character adds dimension.",US
7308,US,"Soft, subtle flavors of classic Chardonnay mingle with warming spice in this friendly but simple white. Pair with salad or seafood.",US
7309,US,"This friendly, likeable wine offers approachable, slightly sweet flavors—fruity and fresh—that are not complex but will pair well with food.",US
7310,US,"Simple and superoaky, with strong flavors of vanilla and char dominating an otherwise average Chard. Under all that smoky wood you'll find a wine of modest peach, pineapple and apricot flavors.",US
7311,US,"These Edna Valley Chards always seem to be tart in acids and fairly lean in apple and white peach fruit, with a strong minerality. Chablisian, if you will. This one fits the mold perfectly. Dry and crisp, it can easily accompany mussels or oysters.",France
7312,US,"This is quite a sophisticated Chard, showing the quality of wines that cost far more. It's rich, with toasty oak that frames flavors of pineapples, buttered toast, spicy mango and ripe white peach. Feels creamy through a long, spicy finish.",US
7313,US,"This very dry wine is earthy, with a dusty, tannic flavor of hazelnut skin and a slight bitterness, but it rewards with deeper tastes of white peach, and a rich overlay of oak.",US
7314,US,"They put the words “dry farmed” on the label to indicate, I suppose, extra concentration, and indeed, this is an intense Chard. It's bone dry, well-oaked, high in acidity and intricately layered in tropical fruit and orange custard flavors. Combines elegance, style and power in the glass.",US
7315,US,"Winemaker Bob Bertheau lays back on the new oak and gives this great vineyard its due. A classic spine of juicy acid, with ripe—but not fat—citrus and apricot flavors. Long, balanced and tightly focused.",US
7316,US,"Tasted side by side with the winery's Clone 96 from the same vineyard, this tasty Chard is a bit firmer and denser, although it shares the same qualities of big, exotic fruit and oak, and a rich, leesy creaminess. Both are very fine wines to watch in future vintages.",US
7317,US,"From the Sonoma side of Carneros. It satisfies all around, from the rich tropical fruit and spice flavors to the creamy texture and refreshingly crisp mouthfeel to the deliciously long finish.",US
7318,US,"This explodes with full-flavored fruit. A big boy, juicy and concentrated with ripe apple/citrus fruits, and well-integrated streaks of vanilla, hazelnut and butterscotch.",US
7319,US,"Showing that earthy, dried herb character that so often marks Napa Chardonnays, this Oakville-grown wine is soft in acids and rich in spicy, creamy oak and lees notes. It has pleasantly ripe apple, peach and pineapple flavors.",US
7320,US,"It's refreshing to find this kind of high acidity in a California Chard, but that doesn't mean that this is a rich, fruity wine. It's tart in mineral and lime flavors, with a very dry finish. Try with mussels or oysters.",France
7321,US,"Flora Springs has made this wine for many years, keeping the price pretty much the same. It's still a sophisticated bottle of Chardonnay, dry and fruity and, as the designation suggests, rich in toasty oak notes.",US
7322,US,"Call it Chablis-like. This Chard is bone dry, crisp in citrusy acidity, and features stony, minerally flavors of Meyer lemons and limes. Try as a richer alternative to Pinot Grigio.",US
7323,US,"Tastes like there's lots of toasty, charry, smoky oak on this big, ripe wine, but the papaya, nectarine and hazelnut croissant flavors are sizeable and can shoulder the wood. The finish is long, spicy and impressively rich.",US
7324,US,"One quarter of this wine went through malolactic, and it retains a riveting acidity. Pineapple and citrus fruit is wrapped in rock. It's very young and tight, but along with sharp lime and citrus come fleshier stone fruit flavors and hints of melon and caramel. Give this plenty of breathing time, or decant it.",US
7325,US,"Superripe and oaky in pineapple, white peach purée, pear tart, buttered toast and vanilla-infused crème brûlée, this Chardonnay is saved from mere richness by crisp coastal acidity and a fine spine of minerals. Exotic and delicious, it's at its best now.",US
7326,US,"Even in a high acid vintage such as 2008, this is rich, almost oily, a full-throttle wine well-endowed with full-bodied fruit flavor. Though 50% new oak is used, the barrels are bigger (92 gallons instead of 55) which reduces the toastiness. A wine that will not disappoint fans of the John Abbott/Abeja style.",US
7327,US,"A light, subtle nose is followed by simple but elegant Chardonnay flavors and a successful play of oak and acid. The mouthfeel is equally appealing, round and supple. The wine could use more complexity but overall, is enjoyable and will be good with a variety of richer poultry and seafood dishes.",US
7328,US,Nice bright fruit aromas and a lively play of minerality and good fresh fruit make this a definite everyday choice for fans of cleaner whites. The wine is not terribly deep but it's playful and flavorful.,US
7329,US,"This is a wine that takes some time to warm up to—on first sniff there's a somewhat sulfuric, rustic aroma to it. On the palate, a viscous mouthfeel feels a bit heavy, but then there's the fruit, which exhibits good classic Chardonnay flavors and is balanced by elegant oak. A good choice for casual sipping.",US
7330,US,"A rustic but likeable Chardonnay, this offers subtle flavors of oak and fruit in a balanced but somewhat innocuous package. Not much beyond the initial wave of flavors; it wants more complexity and weight.",US
7331,US,"A spicy, tingling nose leads. followed by reserved balance elements of acid, classic Chardonnay fruit and a slatey minerality. Not terribly complex but likeable, and food friendly.",US
7332,US,"Pineapple and spice on the nose are followed by like flavors on the palate. An interplay of acid adds quality to the wine but overall, it lacks dimension and the kind of layering that typifies good Chardonnay.",US
7333,US,"Though found in some Chardonnays, there's a heaviness to this wine, with its orange Muscat nose and syrupy flavors, that seems out of sync here. The wine seems to flop onto the palate and sit there, without much progression. Needs more acid and a lighter touch.",US
7334,US,"Fresh, crisp minerality—a quality that can take a good wine to great heights in the right proportion—seems to hinder this wine. The lack of fruit and oak balance feels tart and thin.",US
7335,US,"Earthy aromas of Chardonnay fruit and toast lead on this wine with a   somewhat prickly character. Lean and simple, it wants more spice and a softer mouthfeel to make it work.",US
7336,US,"Tastes sugared, and the fruit is thin, making the alcohol taste hot.",US
7337,US,"A somewhat candied nose leads, and on the palate, a clumsy sweetness creates a flabbiness over simple fruit that seems unnecessary. Lacks poise but will pair well with cheeses and seafood.",US
7338,US,"This is a creative if not entirely successful wine; its intense, lavish aromas are followed by a surprisingly rustic wave of fruit that has a spin of austerity to it. One-dimensional and rough around the edges.",US
7339,US,"There's an appealing earthiness on the nose and palate, but the overall character is a bit discordant. It has some complexity but not the balance one wants from a Chardonnay.",US
7340,US,"From a warmish Monterey County appellation comes this soft, creamy Chard. It has pretty flavors of very ripe white peaches and apricots, drizzled with vanilla, and seems a little sweet.",US
7341,US,"Good melon, apple and vanilla aromas precede honey, vanilla and spice flavors. It's sweet, ripe and easy to drink, with touches of wood and marshmallow. Where this concept wine scores best is on the tongue: It has generous acidity and enough body to ensure balance.",France
7342,US,"This is a very peculiar Chard. The new oak is powerful, acidity is high despite partial malo, and there's a strong impact from sur lie aging. All this manipulation has resulted not in complexity but in a heavy-handed wine.",US
7343,US,"Tastes kind of thin and simple, with watery flavors of peaches, alcohol and oak that finish quick. But it's a clean, balanced wine.",US
7344,US,"Bitter oak, a sugary mouthfeel, and an earthy, chunky, pineapple candy-flavored palate.",US
7345,US,"I actually like this wine more than Miner's more expensive '02 Wild Yeast Chard, with which it was simultaneously released. It's not as overwrought. Here, the tasty fruit takes over, with good results.",US
7346,US,"Offers lime, pineapple and mango flavors—even a hint of banana—with bright acidity and hints of vanilla and buttered toast. There's nothing subtle about this Chard.",US
7347,US,"This wine is a bit tough and gritty, with an earthy, tobaccoey edge, but it has enough cream, green apple and peach flavors to satisfy. Finishes fully dry, with spices and apples.",US
7348,US,"Everything about this Chard is brilliantly crafted, but the parts haven't come together. It's all fine charred oak, creamy, yeasty lees and primary peach, pear and tropical fruit, battling it out. But it's a very fine wine, and simply needs a while to coalesce. Try in a few months.",US
7349,US,"The Dutton-Goldfield style is to emphasize acidity and minerality, then to lavish winemaker interventions in the form of oak and lees. This is a Chablisian wine, if you will, dry and crisp, with complex flavors ranging from lemons and cinnamon to gun metal and pineapples. It's very elegant and food-friendly.",US
7350,US,"This is a best-of selection from this vineyard. It's a concentrated version of the regular Double L bottling. Completely dry, filled with stony minerals smothering ripe yellow peach flavors, it's an immature wine that calls to mind grand cru Chablis. Should develop well through 2008 and possibly beyond.",France
7351,US,"From a two acre plot in Walla Walla, this lush, elegant wine shows Kurt Schlicker's deft, complex approach to winemaking. 100% barrel fermented, it clocks in at 14% alcohol and tastes of clean fruit, with light hints of buttered toast and toasted nuts. Elegant and sophisticated, it shows a deft touch with the wood.",US
7352,US,"What Dutton Ranch Chards share is a crisp, appley crunchiness, edging into the tropics in a good vintage. In this case, it adds rich new oak and a creamy, leesy mouthfeel, and the flavors approach decadent guava and nectarine.",US
7353,US,"You can smell the minerals in this tight, compelling wine. It has an aroma suggesting cold metal, even a touch of diesel, floating above the guava, pineapple, nectarine and peach flavors. Smoky oak and zesty acidity help make this Chard very complex and satisfying.",US
7354,US,"This single-vineyard Chardonnay impresses for its taut structure and promise of aging. It's totally dry, and beneath that slate and metal is a core of ripe yellow peach. Fans of blowsy Chards will find it spare, but if you like Chablis, you'll love the complex, stony minerality. Hold until 2007.",US
7355,US,"The winery doesn't tell us where in this gigantic, multi-county region the grapes came from, but it's quite a good wine. Firm in citrusy acids, with a mineral undertow, it's a dry, elegant wine with complex notes of pineapples, buttered toast and creamy lees. Lots of oak, but it's integrated with the fruit.",US
7356,US,"Januik knows this vineyard inside and out and takes full advantage of its strengths. Despite the malolactic treatment, the wine remains firm in structure, with green apple and spiced pear fruit. It feels soft and creamy, but has enough acid to retain its lively finish, with a lick of light butterscotch and hazelnut crème. Full, rich and seamless.",US
7357,US,"From an excellent, cool, Yakima Valley vineyard, the Elerding Chardonnay exhibits firm, lightly spicy green apple fruit with pink grapefruit and citrus notes. Aged on the lees for 10 months in new French oak barrels.",US
7358,US,"A pretty, floral nose adds a surprising dimension to this wine, but on the palate, the flavors fall somewhat flat. A good balance of oak and fruit prevails, but the nose suggests more.",US
7359,US,"There's a lack of balance, with thin, slightly bitter fruit overriding any complexity that may have been achieved with more oak. This is not offensive, it just lacks character.",US
7360,US,"I liked Morgan's Double L Chard for its Chablis-like character. This wine is more so. It's drier, more acidic and more elegant, but there's nothing lean about the power of its core of tropical fruit, which detonates on the palate and doesn't stop. There's fascination with every sip, as the wine slowly changes in the glass. This is a great wine and showcases the infinite possibilities of this appellation.",US
7361,US,"Very bright and zingy, with that brilliant shine of citrusy acidity you find in a good Carneros Chard. The apple, peach and spice flavors finish in a rich, creamy swirl of fruit and oak.",US
7362,US,"Compared to those fat, rich Chards that are hard to pair with food, this one's Chablisian. It's tart in acids and tangy in minerals and stones, with a richly controlled taste that's part apple-citrus fruit and part oak.",US
7363,US,"High in sweet, toasty oak, with peach, pear and apple flavors that persist in the long finish, this pleasant Chardonnay has lots to like.",US
7364,US,"What they seem to mean by “faux Chablis” is searingly high acidity, little or no oak, rasping dryness and early-picked, green fruit that's supposed to be minerally. Not a generous wine.",France
7365,US,"You'll find good flavors of apples and peaches in this soft, dryish wine, as well as an earthiness. It has some oaky notes, and finishes with a touch of citrus.",US
7366,US,"Fruity enough, with white peach and pineapple flavors enriched with a dollop of smoky oak and a chalky minerality in the finish. This is a fine everyday Chardonnay with some real complexity and elegance.",US
7367,US,"The oak contributes buttered toast, butterscotch and caramel flavors to this dry, crisp wine, but the underlying fruit isn't strong enough to support all that weight. Shows only modest flavors of pineapples, kiwis and minerals. Disappointing.",US
7368,US,"From the winery's Carneros vineyard, a true reserve-style, low-production wine. It's built along the same lines as the regular Chard, with a mineral tang to the fruit flavors and a finish that combines spices and oak. Notable for its elegance and balance.",US
7369,US,"“In the buff,” as you might suppose, means no oak, no malolactic. It is nonetheless quite stacked with flavor, thick currents of pear, peach and other stone fruits, and plenty of natural acid to keep it lively in the mouth. This is the sort of honest, no-nonsense wine that Chardonnay rarely can be—more like a sturdy red in the way it coats the tongue and lingers.",US
7370,US,"This is a new brand for me, and they're off to a promising start with this dry, minerally Chardonnay. It packs a punch with upfront lemon and lime, passion fruit and pineapple flavors that are pushed forward by great acidity, while oak adds a fine appliqué. This wine is notable for its balance, elegance and sheer deliciousness.",US
7371,US,"Superripe and super-oaked, with syrupy fruit flavors, this is somebody's idea of the popular style, but it's really an exaggerrated one. Where's the balance?",France
7372,US,"Simple and fruity, with canned peach and pear flavors that drink a little heavy, and finish a bit sweet. Okay for everyday fare.",France
7373,US,"I have tasted a number of bottle-aged Hanzell Chardonnays, and when properly cellared from a good vintage, they are totally amazing. This is likely to be such a wine, but right now, it's tight, tart and earthy, with hints of peach. It's not a mind blower, but is a Chard for those serious about their cellars. Best after 2010.",US
7374,US,"First bottle corked. Second bottle sound, but rather one dimensional. The fruit is simple green apple and green berry; but there is a distinct earthy undertone that carries into the finish. If new oak barrels were used, they are not evident.",US
7375,US,"A wonderful follow-up to the debut vintage, this generous Chardonnay brings green apples, stone fruits and suggestions of pineapple, with a judicious use of new oak that refrains from becoming more than a pleasing nuance. Excellent balance, with a firm, lingering finish that brings in butterscotch and ripe, sweet lemon.",US
7376,US,"Rich and intense, it's packed with buttery toasty scents of roasted hazelnuts, floral highlights (jasmine) and clean apple, citrus and pear fruit. Despite the big oak flavors, it keeps its acidity front and center and its flavors lifted.",US
7377,US,"Call it Chablisian for its high acidity and dry minerality, with suggestions of herbs and mushrooms that create a deep undertow to the brighter peach and pineapple flavors. This is a powerful, very complex wine, easily able to handle its share of new French oak.",US
7378,US,"This inexpensive Chard tastes herbal, with dill and thyme flavors that turn mildly peachy and appley on the finish.",US
7379,US,"Pretty light, but a decent value. Flavors are of apples, oak and spice.",US
7380,US,"There's plenty of ripe fruit here, but the wine has too much oak, and has a weird salty flavor. The varietal identity is proper.",US
7381,US,"Cool climate all the way, from the brisk, metallic, acidic mouthfeel to the flavors of citrus zest, with a hint of peach. The winemaker has added notes of lees and delicate oak that enrich the wine and bring it to completion.",US
7382,US,"Everything's controlled in this balanced, harmonious Chard. The tropical fruit is ripe, oak is judiciously applied, creamy lees are just right. It's a very elegant, pure wine that gets better and better with every sip.",US
7383,US,"Chardonnay in Rutherford? Yes, and a very good one. It has polished peach and apple flavors as well as a sweet, rich coat of oak, and is balanced, crisp and dry.",US
7384,US,"Without showing the richness of prior vintages, this year's bottling is earthy and crisp and very dry. It has a steely minerality and modest fruit that suggests green apples and pineapples.",US
7385,US,"Gallo scores with this ripe, creamy Chard. It fills the mouth with tropical fruit, vanilla custard and woodspice flavors. Not a complex wine, it's a guaranteed crowd pleaser.",US
7386,US,"There's lots of oak on this ripe wine, which has forward tropical fruit and spice flavors and a richly creamy texture from barrel fermentation. It's a bit simple, though.",US
7387,US,"A nice, relatively inexpensive Chardonnay to enjoy with fish, pork and chicken. Dry and creamy, it has flavors of pears, guava and spicy vanilla.",US
7388,US,"Dry and zesty in acidity, this Chard offers flavors of apricots, green apples, pears and butter cream. It's pretty good for this everyday price.",US
7389,US,"In this freeze-plagued year the estate vineyard was shut out, but any Chardonnay that is made of 100% Celilo Vineyard fruit has nothing to apologize about. Lots of toasty oak jumps out from this still-tight, acidic wine, but as it opens the crisp mix of pear, pineapple and citrus, along with a hint of rock, creates a firm and balanced, very pleasing wine.",US
7390,US,"The home vineyard is in a cool, southeastern part of the valley, and you can smell the minerality in this crisp, young wine, grown in the fog. It's exceptionally bright in steely tangerine, kiwi and pineapple flavors whose smoky oak veneer is in perfect balance.",US
7391,US,"This is Chris Gorman's first white wine; it has been babied and it shows. The wild yeast fermentation in 100% new French oak really piles on the rich, butterscotch flavors, along with toast, spice, nutmeg and caramel. But there's fruit to match, powerful and thick, with impressive length and weight.",US
7392,US,"A little softer than K-J's Camelot Highlands, but no less delicious, with similar lemon drop and custard flavors and a tinge of sweet, ripe pear. The mouthfeel is round, creamy and full-bodied, with a complex veneer of toasty oak.",US
7393,US,"Kind of earthy and mute, and also soft, with the flavor of canned fruit syrup, although it's fairly dry.",US
7394,US,"If there's any fruit in this massively oaked wine, it's hard to find. Little but char, vanilla and toast hit you, with a sweet dill finish.",US
7395,US,"Super-oaky, with what smells and tastes like heavy char that gives it a burnt, ashy note, although there are some decent peach flavors.",US
7396,US,"There's certainly a lot of flashy oak and lees here, contributing pretty  vanilla and caramel flavors. But there's something disjointed about the underlying wine, which lacks vibrancy.",US
7397,US,"You'll find lots of acidity and oak in this wine. In between is the fruit, a mélange of apples, peaches, pineapples and mangoes. Despite being five years old, it's still fresh and vital, but you should probably drink it now before it loses its polished youthfulness.",US
7398,US,"Take either of Buena Vista's clonal bottlings of Chardonnay from this vineyard and kick them down a notch, and you get this wine. It's not quite as complex, but still a rich, supple Chard, a little soft but flamboyant in tropical fruit, oak and buttercream.",US
7399,US,"Peaches and apricots fill the mouth. The wine has a supple, rich midpalate, and a nice smack of butterscotch to finish.",US
7400,US,"Tropical fruit flavors of pineapple, banana and melon initiate this young, nicely focused, rather toasty/buttery effort. Some of the vines are almost 30 years old. Though not as over-the-top with the new oak as some past vintages, the '03 will benefit from further bottle time and may well have the complexity and the composition to age nicely for six to eight years.",US
7401,US,"On the soft and sweet side, with the flavor of extremely ripe white peaches drizzled with vanilla, caramel and buttercream. What this New World Chard lacks in complexity it makes up for in sheer, lip-smacking deliciousness.",US
7402,US,"I like the dryness and crispness of this food-friendly wine, but it's not the fruitiest Chard to come down the pike. It's an earthy wine, with herb flavors veering into peaches, and enough oaky-leesy creaminess to add interest.",US
7403,US,"For ten bucks you get a dry, crisp and tasty wine, brimming with apricot, pineapple and vanilla flavors, wrapped into a creamy texture. This is a good price for a Chardonnay of this quality.",US
7404,US,"Light and oxidative, with soft, toasty buttery flavors. The fruit is hidden behind all the buttered popcorn flavors. It's drinking well enough at the moment, but aging very quickly.",US
7405,US,"Lemon yellow, scented with Bourbon barrel, ripe apples, light honey and tea. It's soft and round, with forward, plush flavors of very ripe apples, banana, cantaloupe and lots of buttery oak.",US
7406,US,"Lots of ripe tropical fruit in this wine, with pastry-filling pineapple, peach, butterscotch and vanilla spice flavors. Although technically dry, it has a richly honeyed finish.",US
7407,US,"A little one-dimensional and on the soft side, but enormously rich in apple butter, pineapple custard, apricot jam, gingerbread, vanilla honey and sweet oak flavors.",US
7408,US,"There aren't many Chards from this hilly Mendocino area. This wine shows dryness and ripeness, with a stony minerality undergirding peach custard and pineapple tart flavors, enriched with a satisfying touch of smoky oak.",US
7409,US,"Here's a minerally, acidic, very dry Chard with a firm structure. Slightly earthy, it has citrus fruit, smoky oak and spice flavors, with a wet stone, metallic tang in the finish.",US
7410,US,"Zelma Long consults with winemaker Caleb Foster, and this beautifully detailed wine shows her distinctive stamp. Barrel fermented in used Burgundy barrels, with no acid or water additions. Lees stirring adds creamy, light flavors of butterscotch, balanced against crisp green apple and pink grapefruit.",US
7411,US,"There's some richness in this well-made wine, which is showing peach and tropical fruit flavors, with vanilla and toast accents. Finishes a bit astringent, calling for rich shellfish.",US
7412,US,"Solid, fresh with succulent fruit hinting at white peaches and a dusting of cinnamon and sweet spice. Finishes with good length and hints of honey, tea and apricot. Nice effort.",US
7413,US,"Clarksburg, in the warm Delta region, is better known for Chenin Blanc. This Chard shows its origins in the softness and earthiness that accompanies the apple flavors. It's a perfectly decent everyday sipper.",US
7414,US,"A plump, medium-bodied Chardonnay with a deft touch of oak, this is what most California Chardonnay drinkers are looking for in an entry-level wine. Slightly nutty, toasty elements frame bold pineapple and citrus flavors.",US
7415,US,"A sharp, edgy wine, lifted with a bit of volatility, then smoothed over with a honeyed sweetness. Very ripe, soft, peachy and definitely ready to drink.",US
7416,US,"This is the winery's big, barrel-fermented Chard. Even under all that creamy, smoky oak and leesy richness, those Edna Valley acids shine through, making the lime, kiwi and pineapple flavors bright, and leading to a zingy, crisp finish.",US
7417,US,"A real value at this price, considering its rich array of tropical fruit and creamy texture. Finishes with a swirl of spicy vanilla.",US
7418,US,"This sure is an oaky Chard, but it's big enough to handle it. The fruit is extraordinarily ripe and forward, bursting with mango, pear and sautéed banana flavors. What the wine lacks in subtlety it makes up for in sheer, unadulterated power.",US
7419,US,"Lots of vanilla, spice and buttered nuts, set in a tight, stylish frame. Clean citrus and apple fruit, made in a fresh, crisp and penetrating style.",US
7420,US,"Apple sauce, peach purée, buttercream, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors characterize this tasty Napa Chard. It has a scour of refreshing acidity and a long, pleasant, fairly complex finish.",US
7421,US,"Rich and round, this young wine is still showing the edges of its new oak, but offers crisp apple and pear flavors along with the vanilla, toast and hazelnut of the wood, and balanced acidity. The sharpness should smooth out with additional bottle age.",US
7422,US,"Soft and broad, with rich flavors of butter cookie, toasted coconut, baked pear and light citrus. Just 500 cases were made.",US
7423,US,"No malolactic fermentation makes this wine very acidic in feeling, with a fresh, green apple crispness. The flavors veer towards apples, limes and Meyer lemons, with complexities of mango and apricot. It's a very intense wine, and a notably good one. One sip is not enough. A bottle may be.",US
7424,US,"I like this wine because it's different. You'll find green apple and pineapple flavors, and various toasted notes of wood, coconut and hazelnut, not to mention lees and Oriental spice. Those crisp Green Valley acids undergird the richness. Finishes complex and with great finesse.",US
7425,US,"Shows great class and finesse with its well-ripened fruit that's controlled with a clean minerality and high acidity. Oak and lees are both there, in supporting roles. The finish is ultraclean and citrusy, in this complex, dry white wine.",US
7426,US,"Here's a good, everyday Chardonnay. It has ripe tropical fruit and vanilla flavors, with a creamy mouthfeel and hints of charry oak. It proves that California can produce value wines of quality and interest in huge quantities.",US
7427,US,"From the cool side of Paso Robles comes this Chard, which nonetheless shows its warm appellation in its earthiness, which resembles some Napa Chards. The fruit veers toward apples, and the wine is totally dry.",US
7428,US,"Super-rich in tropical fruit, pineapple, apricot, pear and vanilla custard flavors, this is a useful, crowd-pleasing Chardonnay at an affordable price.",US
7429,US,"Tastes a bit tired, with apricot and pineapple flavors that are losing their fruity flesh, showing herbal bones. Dry and crisp, it's unlikely to improve with further age.",US
7430,US,"A pretty nice Chardonnay at an affordable price. Dry and crisp, it shows pleasant flavors of pineapples, pears, peaches, vanilla and buttercream.",US
7431,US,"So high in acidity that it creates a tingly burn on the palate, this dry wine is bright and forward in lemon and lime flavors, and a tangy minerality. Finishes fine and clean.",US
7432,US,"Very dry, and on the earthy side, this Chard is marked more by controlled elegance than by opulent fruit. There are flavors of lemons and limes and tart green apples, with additional complexities from barrel fermentation and sur lies aging. The finish is fairly acidic.",US
7433,US,"Very fruity, with bright melon, pineapple and red apple flavors. It's a step up from the well-made 2003, with crisp fruit and a bit more complexity. A second taste reveals a tart, racy, fruit-forward food wine with fine balance; a great choice for seafood or chicken salad.",US
7434,US,"Crisp, bright acidity marks this dry, clean Chardonnay. It's bone dry, but rewardingly fruity, showing ripe peach, pear and pineapple flavors, with a richer streak of crème brûlée. Easy to find, with 23,544 cases made.",US
7435,US,"A rich, fine Chardonnay that recalls how good this coastal valley can grow the great white grape of Burgundy. Complex in pineapple, pear, tropical fruit, butterscotch and cinnamon spice flavors, it has adequate acidity. At its best now, so drink up.",US
7436,US,"Quite a nice Chardonnay at a great price. It's rich and creamy and plump, with deliciously ripe flavors of pineapples, Asian pears, buttered cinnamon toast and vanilla. The richness is balanced by crisp acidity and a firm minerality.",US
7437,US,"Shows the limpid quality of Carneros Chard, with its crisp acidity and tang of minerality. The fruit veers toward green apples and pineapples, and as good as it is, the palate needs to be a little stronger and more concentrated.",US
7438,US,"This likeable wine gets the basic Chard job done with its creamy texture, veneer of sweet, toasty oak, and flavors of peaches, pineapples and pears. Nice spices on the finish.",US
7439,US,"A huge, complex wine that flatters the palate with enormously rich, layered flavors of lemondrop, vanilla custard and butterscotch flavors. Fortunately, there's crisp Central Coast acidity.",US
7440,US,"This is obviously a cool climate Chard, to judge from the brisk acids, citrusy flavors and hint of minerality that makes the wine bracing and strong. Yet oak and lees lend softening, complexing notes.",US
7441,US,"Polished and elegant, this Chard has real complexity. Works beautifully to integrate its dry apple, peach and pineapple flavors, oak-driven cream and crisp acids into a coherent whole.",US
7442,US,"Very similar in terroir-driven flavors to Rusack's less expensive Chardonnay, with citrus and orange blossom flavors, a steely, minerally note and modest oak. The structure is more angular, with very high acidity leading to a long finish.",US
7443,US,"A decent everyday Chard, with ripe flavors of pineapples, peaches and pears, and an oaky influence of vanilla and buttercream.",US
7444,US,"Nice and dry, with brisk acidity framing pineapple, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors, boosted with a touch of smoky oak.",US
7445,US,"A rich, creamy wine loaded with toasted almond, vanilla cookie, bright melon and apple, and hints of white peach—there is a lot going on here. The acids sharpen up the fruit flavors, and the wine has a clean edge, along with expressive barrel flavors.",US
7446,US,"The fruit is precise and fine-tuned, showing nuances of mixed green and yellow berries, citrus and stone fruits, along with a smooth vein of butterscotch from barrel aging in new French oak. A sophisticated debut that promises good things to come.",US
7447,US,"This is rich, ripe, fat and seemingly oaky. It may be too much of a good thing. Massive in caramelized, butterscotch, pineapple, peach, apricot, lime and cotton candy flavors, it might overpower any food you have it with. Almost better as a cocktail sipper.",US
7448,US,"Comes across as rather soft and a bit simple, with earth, peach and apple flavors that have been generously oaked. Could use more liveliness and crispness.",US
7449,US,"A decent Chard with some peach, apple and oak flavors, and a creamy texture. Turns a bit sharp and spicy on the finish.",US
7450,US,"This Chardonnay is showing plenty of well-toasted oak, vanilla and caramel flavors and some very ripe tropical-fruit flavors. The creamy texture leads to a slightly rough finish.",US
7451,US,"From the pretty golden color, to the powerful aromas of tropical fruits and toasty oak, to the full-throttle flavors and creamy texture, this is a wonderful Chard. It has complexities that unravel as the wine warms in the glass.",US
7452,US,"Seems riper and juicier than past CDV Chards. Brims with polished apple, peach and pear flavors, and is very spicy. Turns clean and oaky on the finish.",US
7453,US,"Light and buttery, with baked apple fruit and notes of cinnamon; it sounds more like a breakfast pastry than a wine but the flavors are soft and pleasant and it all hangs together well.",US
7454,US,"Oak Knoll is in the southern Napa Valley, and this wine reflects its warmish origins in its softness. Although there are polished flavors of apples and peaches and a rich coating of oak, the wine could have greater brightness and a brisker mouthfeel. Still, it's pretty darned flavorful.",US
7455,US,"With no oak on this wine, you can taste how beautifully Monterey terroir develops Chardonnay. The wine is all crisp acids and ripe flavors of guava, pineapple, mango and peach. Vanilla, too, which must come from the grapes, not barrels. What a delightfully drinkable wine this is.",US
7456,US,"Simple and syrupy, with canned peach and apricot flavors and enough acidity to cut through the semi-sweetness for balance.",US
7457,US,"Here's a good example of a country-style Chard that offers some nice qualities, at a fair price. The equivalent of four regular bottles, it's fruity and off-dry, with peaches and cream flavors that finish clean.",US
7458,US,"A vitamin pill scent greets you immediately, somewhat masking the fruit. In the mouth it's rather light, watery and showing green apple fruit with plenty of acid. The finish softens up but doesn't add any depth or flavor.",US
7459,US,"Here's a tight, acidic young Chard from this cool-climate appellation. It's showing lots of mineral flavors now, against a background of Meyer lemon and apricot, and the finish is totally dry.",US
7460,US,"Not a bad Chard from this warm Central Coast region. It's a little rough around the edges, but is dry and creamy, with a nice mingling of fruit and oaky elements.",US
7461,US,"Not showing much to savor now, a flat, simple wine with earthy, vegetal flavors.",US
7462,US,"A workhorse Chard, fruity and simple, with an artificially oaky, slightly sweet taste.",US
7463,US,"Yummy Chard, complex and delicious. Offers lots of ripe, rich peach and pineapple custard flavors, sweet, toasty oak and a buttery texture. Nice, perky acids keep things lively and clean.",US
7464,US,"This powerfully flavored Chardonnay is laserlike in the intensity of its fruit. Mangoes, pineapples and lemon custard assault the palate, wrapped in a creamy smooth texture. Not particularly subtle, and not for the faint-hearted, this is a quintessentially ripe California wine.",US
7465,US,"The acidity and asperity of this Chard are a bit beyond my comfort zone, but that's Edna Valley for you. It's certainly a distinctive wine, a best-blocks selection rich in lemon, lime and mineral flavors, to which the winemaker has added a filigree of toasted oak.",US
7466,US,"Full-bodied and dry, this 3-year-old Chard is picking up dried fruit notes, although it's still rich in peaches and pineapples. The high acidity has carried the wine this far, but it should be consumed now.",US
7467,US,"Bright, perky fruit stars in this lovely wine. It's ripe in pineapple and tangerine, with a rich, custard and meringue finish, but it's dry and complex. Easy to like.",France
7468,US,"My favorite of N&N;'s three new single-vineyard Chards. Shows broad appeal with its array of peach, apple and tropical fruit flavors, heightened with touches of oak and lees. Young and crisp in acids, it's full-bodied enough to accompany roast duck.",US
7469,US,"Quite an interesting wine, chewy and dense in apple, melon and peach fruits and oak, with a chalky, minerally taste that adds texture. Turns tart with acids on the finish.",US
7470,US,"Firm in acids and minerals, and with well-oaked apple, citrus and peach flavors, this streamlined Chardonnay is clean and balanced. It's a good accompaniment to cracked crab.",US
7471,US,"A little on the watery-thin side, with apricot and pear flavors. Finishes dry and crisp in cool-climate acidity.",France
7472,US,"This wine carries a new label, very spare; the drawing of house and vineyard is gone; it's all white with simple type. The wine is simple, soapy, light and showing just a watery impression of citrus, banana and tropical fruits.",US
7473,US,"An everyday Chardonnay, useful for a wide variety of purposes. Shows a creamy texture with flavors of apricots and citrus.",US
7474,US,"The aim here seems to be to avoid ripe, opulent fruit in favor of an elegantly streamlined wine you might call Chablisian. The result is bone dry, high in aciditiy and lean, with mineral and citrus flavors. This is against the grain these days for fruity Chards.",France
7475,US,"This succulent wine's bright, well-defined fruit flavors of pineapple, grapefruit and citrus add life and lift across the entire palate. The fruit is the star here, and whatever new oak has been applied has been used well. There is just the right touch of butterscotch and toasted almond on the finish, but the fruit keeps the flavors rolling through the back of the palate for a long, leisurely ride.",US
7476,US,"As always, a nice, easy-drinking Chard with plenty of Central Coast character. The cool, long hangtime has given very ripe fruit, while preserving vital acidity. The winemaker brings a deft touch of oak.",US
7477,US,"Bright and lively in acidity and pure fruit, brimming with ripe peach, lime and quince flavors. Oak forms a seasoning, with suggestions of vanilla and toast. A well-balanced wine that will go well with food.",US
7478,US,"The blend includes 2% Viognier, presumably for bouquet. A measure of the classy winemaking that exemplifies this value brand. The nose indeed shows pretty citrus blossom fragrances, and light green apple fruit. Not showing residual sugar or fake vanilla flavors. Simple, straightforward and perfectly pleasant.",US
7479,US,"Fans of oak will exult over this spicy, Burgundian wine. It's slathered with char, honey, butterscotch and vanilla. Still, there's some rich pineapple fruit underneath, and good acidity.",US
7480,US,"Banana, peach, papaya, vanilla, toasted oak and lees all mingle together to make this Chard complex. It also features rich acidity and minerals for extra nuance. May gain added dimensions over the next four years.",US
7481,US,"Unoaked, and  with no malolactic fermentation, this clean, refreshing wine is bright in apple, peach and pear flavors. It has a rich vein of acidity.",US
7482,US,"Rich and vibrant in acid-accented lime, peach, pink grapefruit and tangerine flavors, this creamy, smooth Chard is partly barrel fermented, which gives it a toasty, buttery edge.",US
7483,US,"Fans of oak and fruity tropical flavors will appreciate the price on this well-organized, everyday Chard. It shows pineapple custard, vanilla yogurt and cinnamon spice flavors wrapped into a dry, creamy texture set off by high acidity.",US
7484,US,"Here's a nice, clean Chardonnay whose best features are dryness and a rich coating of oak. The flavors veer toward peaches, apples and pineapples, along with a distinct spiciness and a bracing streak of minerality.",US
7485,US,"Mixes a rich earthiness with a ripe peach finish and lots of toasty, spicy oak. Easy to drink, and not a bad price for an everyday Chard.",US
7486,US,"Peach and tropical fruit flavors highlight this soft wine, with oaky notes. It has a creamy texture and finishes dry.",US
7487,US,"Here's a fat, unctuous, oily Chard, about as ripe as they come. Barrel fermented in all-new oak, it has an overlay of smoky char and caramelized vanilla riding over guava, nectarine and honeysuckle flavors. It sure is decadent.",US
7488,US,"Here's the latest entry into the red-hot unoaked Chardonnay category in America, and it's a solid hit. Dry and crisp, it's rich in apricots, pineapples, tangerines and spices.",US
7489,US,"Lots of toasty oak on this very dry wine, and a big burst of citrusy acids. In fact the fruit veers toward lemons, limes and grapefruits, just nudging into riper green apples and peaches.",US
7490,US,"Not showing well now, but might be an ager. Tart and closed, with youthful acids, lees and oak crowding out the pear, litchi and hazelnut flavors. Could well become interesting after 2007.",US
7491,US,"Old-vine Kestrel Vineyard fruit delivers; this is excellent juice. Concentrated and lush, it's packed with pineapple, green apple, hints of pear and light tropical fruits. A fruit-driven, powerful wine, with cracker and oatmeal flavors showing up in the finish.",US
7492,US,"Toasty and ripe in tropical fruit, vanilla and buttered toast, this is a fancy Chard at an everyday price. Stays clean with fresh acidity.",US
7493,US,"Lighter and fruitier than the Aquinas Chard, this one features similar toast and nut nuances but also bright pineapple and pear flavors.",US
7494,US,"Not too concentrated, but what there is is pretty. Peach and apple flavors have gentle oak shadings, and the wine is creamy and dry.",US
7495,US,"A plump, low-acid Chardonnay that boasts modest fruit levels (some peach and pear) alongside nutty, custardy flavors and a toasty finish.",US
7496,US,"This serviceable Chard has some good fruity, vanilla and spice flavors and a touch of oak. With its creamy texture, it's a nice value.",US
7497,US,"Tart and minerally, this high-acid Chard has green apple pie flavors, sprinkled with cinnamon and nutmeg. It's bone dry, an angular, somewhat lean wine that needs food to show what it can do. Try with grilled salmon.",US
7498,US,"With peach custard, pineapple and smoky, oaky tastes, this is a good, satisfying Chard. It's dry and balanced in acidity, with a nice spiciness.",US
7499,US,"The winery specializes in single-vineyard wines, and this is certainly a unique Chardonnay, but it's not an opulent one. On the contrary, it's flinty, acidic and raspingly dry, which makes one think it was picked early. It's almost like a Sauvignon Blanc, with its puckery lemon flavors.",US
7500,US,"At three years, this Chard is losing some freshness, and is picking up a dried peach and apricot flavor. It's also softening, which emphasizes the creaminess. It's best to pop the cork on this dry wine now.",US
7501,US,"Everything is clean and properly varietal in this well-made wine, which is dry, creamy and a little bit oaky. Could use greater fruity concentration, though.",US
7502,US,"O.K. Chard, but pretty thin, especially for this prestige appellation. The plaster of oak is too strong for the fruit. The flavors are of lemon candy and oak.",US
7503,US,"Tastes like one of those Aussie Chards, with big, flamboyant mango, papaya and guava flavors framed in crisp acidity. If there's any oak, it's not much. What you get in this bone-dry Chard is clean, pure, ripe Sonoma Chardonnay fruit.",US
7504,US,"Made primarily from Delta and Lodi grapes, this is an innocently good Chardonnay, rustic in character, but likeable for its fruit, touch of oak and thoroughly dry character. It finishes with a rich streak of vanilla-drizzled peaches and cream.",US
7505,US,"Rich, creamy and well-oaked, this Chard oozes tropical fruit, caramel and spicy vanilla flavors. It's sweetish in honey on the finish.",US
7506,US,"Very young now, with powerful acids and tightly wound white peach fruit, just nudging into pineapples. Accentuated with oak and lees. Finishes with a punch of minerality.",US
7507,US,"Oaky, supple and structured, this features fresh green apple fruit and plenty of toasty new oak. It's just well made, mostly barrel-fermented (one-third was new French oak) and captures the broad, fruit-driven, barrel-enhanced flavors that make Chardonnay so popular.",US
7508,US,"What's likeable about this wine is that it doesn't go for the cheap thrills of superripe fruit and form of oak flavoring so common in Chards of this price. What you get is a dry, minerally wine, with a firm spine and just enough peach and oak to make it rich and complex.",US
7509,US,"Lots of extracted, ripe pineapples, pears and butter-sauteed bananas, as well as dusty oriental spices and good acidity. There's a smoky edge of charcoal from well-toasted oak in this big wine.",US
7510,US,"This is an oaky Chard, brimming with vanilla, honey and smoky char, with underlying flavors of peaches and tropical fruits. There's also an earthy edge suggesting sweet dried herbs that suggests careful food pairing. A butter-sauteed filet of sole will be fine.",US
7511,US,"Pretty thin in fruit, but it's a clean wine with modest peach and apple flavors and oak shadings.",US
7512,US,"This is a new line of fairly low-priced varieties from this venerable Napa winery. The Chardonnay, made from very ripe grapes, is good and rich in creamy fruit, with balancing acidity.",France
7513,US,"Shows many of the qualities of Chardonnay from this appellation, with high acidity and pure citrus fruit flavors. There's also a lot of new-oaky extract.",France
7514,US,"No oak here, so what you get is upfront acidity that makes for a direct, tart mouthfeel that frames lime, apple and peach flavors veering into pineapples. This is a simple, clean wine.",US
7515,US,"Here's a good, everyday Chard with plenty of fruit and cream flavor and a tangy, crisp mouthfeel. It does the California Chard thing at a fair price. From Stag's Leap Wine Cellars.",US
7516,US,"If you can get past the hard, faux-wax plastic seal, you'll find a sweetish wine, with peaches and cream flavors, and a spicy, honeyed finish.",US
7517,US,"Showing plenty of zesty acidity, this dry Chard has modest flavors of peaches and pineapples, wrapped into a creamy texture. It finishes quick and clean.",US
7518,US,"This is not the Calcaire that was so famous years ago. It feels stretched and pulled and thin, like a Chard one-third its price. Barrel fermentation and sur lies aging are all very nice, but the fruit just isn't there to justify this price.",US
7519,US,"The Conner Lee and Stillwater vineyards provided the grapes, which were fermented with native yeast and kept in 35% new French and 65% once-used barrels. The wine has retained plenty of natural acid and is showing quite a lot of buttery, new oak flavors. The fruit is solid, ripe and full, but one dimensional.",US
7520,US,"This Chard, from two famous vineyards, is a little too tart now for enjoyment. It has a roughness that detracts from the underlying fruit, while the oak sticks out. My hunch is that three or four years will reward your patience.",US
7521,US,"A little earthy and tart, this is a minerally, high-acid Chard with tight flavors of citrus fruits and barely ripened white peach. It has a clean mouthfeel and a swift finish.",US
7522,US,"There's Monterey fruit in here, to judge by the rich lime zest flavor and crisp acidity. There's also a great deal of oak flavor in this easy, likeable Chardonnay. It finishes dry and clean.",US
7523,US,"There's plenty of Chard character in this wine, including upfront peach, pear and pineapple flavors, a creamy texture and some nice buttered toast from oak.",US
7524,US,"Crisp in fresh acids, with a leesy flavor and texture. The fruit veers toward tart citrus fruits, candied apples, and metallic minerals. Finishes with a lime-skin bitterness.",US
7525,US,"Oaky and leesy, with a range of fruits from apples through peaches and pineapples, and tingly with dusty spices and acidity. This is a clean, food-friendly Chard, not too sweet",US
7526,US,"Smells oaky and spicy, but it's almost shockingly lean in fruit. Tastes like oak-flavored alcohol, acids and tannins.",US
7527,US,"A little on the thin side, this wine has modest green apple, pink grapefruit and vanilla char flavors. It's bone dry and crisp, with a fast finish.",US
7528,US,"Decent everyday Chard, but disappointingly thin, especially for a reserve. All the parts are here, from the creamy mouthfeel and oak to the pineapple and nectarine flavors, but it's like a photocopy of a photocopy.",US
7529,US,"A bit on the weedy, sharp side, with some prickly acids. Has just enough peaches and cream flavor to satisfy Chard lovers.",US
7530,US,"There's a lot of oak on this wine, or maybe the wood just dominates because the fruit is so thin. Either way, it's clean, lean and dry.",US
7531,US,"Unctuous and deep gold in color, this ripe, supersaturated wine is loaded with a sensuous mix of tropical and stone fruits, from peach and melon to tangerine and papaya. The acids manage to keep up, lifting what might otherwise turn flabby, and the wine continues to unfold with streaks of caramel and white chocolate. It's a decadent take on Chard, but well done, and definitely made for near-term drinking.",US
7532,US,"Dark, somewhat heavy and quite ripe, a wine with a multitude of intense flavors that range from sweet cherries to blackberry pie and Kahlua. There's even a note of blueberries floating in the firm tannins. Finishes dry, with astringency, suggesting aging for a year or so.",France
7533,US,"Here's an everyday Chard with interesting features. It has citrusy, lime zest flavors and high acidity, and the absolute dryness serves to accentuate the tartness. That makes it very clean, with a razorsharp edge that will be nice with fresh cracked crab.",US
7534,US,"Nothing flashy here, just straightforward, tart fruit flavors leaning to apple, white peach and other cool-climate fruit.",US
7535,US,"If you like your Chards citrusy, tart and on the mineral side, this is for you. Some will find it thin, others will call it elegant and food friendly. For me, at this price, it's a disappointment, although it's certainly oaky.",US
7536,US,"There's lots of richness in this well-ripened wine, with tropical fruit and peach flavors, a creamy texture and a notable overlay of spicy, vanilla-tinged charred oak.",US
7537,US,"Charming, with a good balance of ripe tree fruits, oak, and earthy, herbal notes. Satisfies your Chardonnay tooth, but it's understated enough not to swamp food",US
7538,US,"Shows the bright acidity and citrus of the appellation, and is clean and dry, but could certainly use more fruity concentration.",US
7539,US,"Kind of heavy and dull, with earth and mineral flavors breaking into citrus and green apples. Finishes bone dry and tart in acids. Call it Chablisian.",US
7540,US,"The problem here is a lack of fruit. Except for a hint of Chardonnay peaches and cream, you get little beyond alcohol and acidity. But it's a clean wine.",US
7541,US,"Has most of the elements of a fine Monterey Chard. Keen acids and a lively, clean finish stimulate the tastebuds. The problem is a lack of fruit. The wine teases with peaches, then pulls back and fails to deliver.",US
7542,US,"What a great aroma this wine has: refined oak and all the smoky, vanilla trimmings, framing pineapple, orange rind and lemon custard aromas and flavors. This massive Chard just gives off oodles of fruit. It is balanced with rich, brilliant acidity.",US
7543,US,"The winemaker notes that this wine has undergone no malolactic fermentation, which is rare in an expensive Chard because you don't get that big, fat, rich buttery softness. What you do get is pure pear and tropical fruit that is elaborately oaked in really good barrels. It is fancy and detailed but not blowsy.",US
7544,US,"Tremendously rich and complex, this wine brims with opulent fruit and smoky oak. The fruit is all about mangoes and pineapples and similar tropical fare, while the oak is strong but in balance. Good southland acidity makes it all clean and vibrant. Finishes sweet and crisp.",US
7545,US,"This is not the best example of unoaked Chard. Without any enriching barrel notes, the wine shows raw, thin fruit, citrusy and green.",France
7546,US,"Some green, herbal flavors thin down the apricots and peaches in this simple wine, while the oaky overlay is too strong for the meager fruit.",US
7547,US,"Rochioli's estate Chard, as opposed to their single-vineyard or block bottlings, needs a really stellar year to shine. It's a very good wine, with crisp mineral, date and pineapple flavors, but lacks the richness and complexity that come with warmer vintages.",US
7548,US,"There's lot of oak on top of a somewhat thin wine, but it's pleasant enough, with modest pineapple and peach flavors and dusty spices. Finishes quick, with oak flavors.",US
7549,US,"Too oaky for my tastes, this wine brims with spicy, smoky new-woody flavors and woodsap sweetness that overshadow the fruit. Aren't we past the toothpick stage?",US
7550,US,"To call this Chard “rustic” is no put-down, as it affords some good Chardonnay pleasure at agood price. It's soft in acids, with a thick, creamy mouthfeel and ripe flavors of peach custard and guava.",France
7551,US,"Getting pretty old for a Chard, this wine has lost much of its primary fruit and is turning earthy and fragile. There's an old-lees taste, for aficionados of slightly mature whites.",US
7552,US,"Lots of green apples in this crisp, clean Chard. It's lightly oaked, with a creamy texture and spicy aftertaste. Very food-friendly.",US
7553,US,"Lots to like in this wine. It has ripe peach and pear flavors, with a blast of smoky oak, buttered toast and lees. Finishes rich in honeyed fruit.",US
7554,US,"Ripe in tropical fruit and peaches, and fairly oaky. The rich, creamy texture and long, spicy finish are pleasant.",US
7555,US,"Sweet in caramelized oak and vanilla, with very rich, ripe tropical fruit and pear flavors, this is a decadent Chard. Fortunately, it has good acidity and is clean and firm on the finish.",US
7556,US,"High in acidity, almost sour despite complete malo, this is a very dry wine, and it's thin in fruity flavor. Will do in a pinch, but you can do better for the money.",France
7557,US,Not much going on here besides alcohol and acidity. The fruit is thin and citrusy. A little Viognier adds modest floral notes.,US
7558,US,"Estancia owns some impressive vineyards in the Pinnacles region, but you'd never know it from this wine. It's watery, tasting of alcohol and acidity.",US
7559,US,"An interesting, complex Chard that straddles the line between steely austerity and fruity complexity and pulls it off well. Has citrus and apple flavors with nuances of more flamboyant peach and pear, and a great burst of fresh acidity. The oak is barely noticeable. Finishes dry and elegant.",US
7560,US,"A fine wine, with enough oaky richness to please Chard lovers. The flavors suggest cool peach custard sprinkled with vanilla and a drizzle of butterscotch sauce, while the acids keep this gooey quality crisp and fresh.",US
7561,US,"There's lots of rich acidity in this wine. It braces the tremendous pear and pineapple fruit and sweet oak, and lends the wine zest and structure. Finishes with a brilliant array of tangy spices.",US
7562,US,"Sweet and soft, with apricot, peach and butterscotch flavors.",US
7563,US,"Rustic, soft and sweet, with apricot and oak flavors. Gets the Chard job done in a simple way.",US
7564,US,"This makes you wonder why it took so long for California vintners to understand that Chard doesn't have to be drenched in oak to be succulent. The wine is crisp and dry in pineapple, pink grapefruit, green apple and cinnamon spice flavors. Great with shellfish and grilled chicken.",US
7565,US,"This refreshing Chard keeps all its elements reined in for balance and charm. You'll find apple and peach flavors, subtle oak, crisp acidity and a touch of lees, all wrapped in a creamy texture.",US
7566,US,"Lots to admire in this inexpensive wine, from the tropical fruit flavors to the generous overlay of oak and the crisp, balanced structure. There's real class and harmony here, and it's a good value.",US
7567,US,"A spicy Chard from cool-climate Monterey. It's packed with pear, pineapple and mango flavors whose sweetness is boosted by smoky oak. Finishes with a long, candied flourish.",US
7568,US,"Earthy and simple, with a scour of acidity that lasts into the finish, this wine is marked by peach, apple and dried herb flavors. It's bone dry.",US
7569,US,"Way too thin. There may have been a nice, dry, peach-flavored Chard here, but it's been diluted nearly to water and oak.",US
7570,US,"This Chard has some decent citrus and peach fruit, but it's really too tart and sour to offer much pleasure.",France
7571,US,This Chard is kind of thin in fruit and top heavy in oak. It tastes of alcohol mildly flavored with peach essence and slathered in toast and vanilla.,US
7572,US,"Soft, kind of flat and thin in flavor, with notes of apples, peaches and oak, and a dry finish.",US
7573,US,"Clumsy and simple, with a tart, tobaccoey taste that's vaguely reminiscent of canned peaches.",US
7574,US,"Impresses for the sheer volume of the fruit. Flamboyant tropical pineapple, mango, guava, lots of dusty spices, rich oak, but manages to hold onto balance, dryness and even a sense of finesse all the way through the long finish.",US
7575,US,"Oaky and sweet in honey, mango, papaya and pear flavors, swirled with vanilla. Fortunately there's a good grip of acidity to balance the sweetness.",US
7576,US,"Bright in acidity, with nice apple, peach and sweet oak flavors. Finishes with butter, spice and vanilla.",US
7577,US,"Starts with spicy oak and smoky vanilla flavors, and offers modest peach and tropical fruit flavors suggesting pineapple grilled on a skewer. Clean and tasty.",US
7578,US,"Lots of oak here, with the requisite vanilla, buttered toast and sweet wood notes on top of modest peach and tropical fruit flavors.",US
7579,US,"Has lots in common with more expensive Chards, such as ripe pear and tropical fruit flavors, dusty spices, smoky oak and a creamy texture. Finishes a little sweet. This is a great price.",US
7580,US,"Everything's on steroids in this big, big Chard. For starters, the tropical fruit and spice flavors are enormously ripe and concentrated. So is the oak, which has been liberally applied so that the wine bursts with vanilla and buttered toast. Fortunately, there's good acidity to keep everything balanced.",US
7581,US,"Farrell likes to pick early, and thus trades opulence for acidity, elegance and possible ageworthiness. Here you'll find a tight, lemony wine, very crisp. The wine is marked by oak and lees, which add flavor and textural nuances, but it remains flinty and austere.",US
7582,US,"Made mainly from vineyards in Green Valley, the wine was barrel fermented and underwent complete malolactic fermentation. The French oak barrels were 50% new. This level of intervention was appropriate to the underlying wine, which is massive in tropical fruit, pear, fig and melon flavors. The result is complex and lush.",US
7583,US,"Actually a Blanc de Blancs, since it's 100% Chardonnay, this is a wine of great purity, maybe because of the organic grapes. The bread dough, vanilla and subtle peach flavors have a very rich, creamy texture, without the jaggedness of ordinary bubblies. This is an important new addition to California's sparkling wine portfolio.",US
7584,US,"Awkward and overoaked, with apricot flavors and deficient acidity, which mars the slight sweetness.",France
7585,US,"With this wine Iron Horse takes a giant step toward great Chablis. By that I mean the intense dryness and zesty acidity, and the tangy grip of iron and wet stone that undergirds the Meyer lemon, pineapple zest, honeysuckle, apricot, cinnamon spice and new oak flavors. This Chard is all about structural integrity. It should have a useful life of at least six years, gaining momentum and nuance.",US
7586,US,"Ed Sbragia loves new oak, and this one has 100% of it, which makes it toasty and woody. The underlying wine is dry and crisp, with peach, apple and pear flavors, but the oak is very heavy, leading to a crème brûlée finish without the sweetness.",US
7587,US,"Turning old, tired and funky, with dried leaf flavors and a tart, rasping finish. This Chard is just too old.",US
7588,US,"Dry and acidic, with an unclean finish, this is a Chardonnay to avoid.",US
7589,US,"Lovely, fresh, clean, with pure apricot, honey, sweet-sour pineapple, caramel, smoke, vanilla aromas. Fresh and creamy, fruity, oaky. Notable for bright acidity. Finishes complex and spicy.",US
7590,US,"Rather sharp and tart in green apple bitterness, and pretty acidic through the finish, although the oak and cream make up for it. But that structure works in favor of food.",US
7591,US,"Lots to admire here, and not just the price. This is a dry, smooth wine, with good varietal character. The apple and peach flavors are lightly oaked. Best Buy",US
7592,US,"Doesn't show a lot of fruit, with citrus flavors just verging into tart green apples. Very clean and zesty with acidity, with oak shadings, it will be good with broiled salmon.",US
7593,US,"With no oak, what you get in the aroma are the prettiest, cleanest scents of ripe apples, peaches, pears and spices. Would earn a higher score if it weren't soft and syrupy-sweet.",US
7594,US,"An excellent Washington Chardonnay, whole cluster pressed, barrel fermented, unfined and naturally stabilized. Minimum intervention winemaking, giving extra nuances of crisp citrus, rind, pear and blossoms. Fragrant and food friendly.",US
7595,US,"The winemaker has crafted a tight, minerally, Chablis-style wine that's high in acidity. You won't find cascades of fruit or massive oak here, but tart citrus and green apple flavors and a firm, steely mouthfeel. Yet the wine possesses an undefinable quality of elegance. Cellar this for as long as you like.",US
7596,US,"Impressive for its taut, tightly knit flavors of apples, peaches and pears, held together by firm acids and a smattering of dusty tannins. A high percentage of oak also contributes tannins, as well as sweet vanilla and toast.",US
7597,US,"Chardonnay rarely rises above the mundane, but when it does, you wonder why doesn't everyone make it like this? Big and voluptuous, this gorgeous bottling retains enough acid and balance to deliver the big-time goods with finesse. Silky, ripe, lush yet sculpted, it plays out deliciously through an extremely long and richly fruity palate.",France
7598,US,"Showing the depth and nuance that mark great Chardonnay, this benefitted from its chilly location in the Petaluma Gap in this hot vintage. The coolness allowed the grapes to achieve maximally ripe tropical fruit, nectarine and peach flavors, while preserving vital acidity. Extra dry and elegant, it's a Chard that can take up to six years of cellaring without missing a beat.",US
7599,US,"I love this for its absolute dryness and crispness and minerally depth. There's something coldly metallic in the taste and mouthfeel, and to the extent there's fruit, it's of grapefruits and lime zest, with a flowery exoticness. Sur lies aging and toasty new oak have added richness and layers of subtle nuance. Strikes you for the sheer excellence of its balance. Enjoy now–2010.",US
7600,US,"Nice and dry, with smoky oak framing tropical fruit and peach flavors, finishing with Asian spices. With its crisp acids and rich fruitiness, it's a natural for shellfish or creamed chicken.",US
7601,US,"What great structure you get in this quintessentially food-friendly wine. Absolutely dry, it shows a crisp mineralityF to the pear, pineapple, toasted meringue and sweet, charry oak flavors, and the finish is amazingly deep and long. This is really an impressive Chardonnay.",US
7602,US,"Very soft in the mouth, with popcorn butter flavors and hints of green apple. Tastes as though it all went through malolactic fermentation; if so, it might have been better had they left some higher-acid wine in the blend.",US
7603,US,"Has some ripe peach and pear fruit and an oaky veneer, but can't overcome its rustic mouthfeel. The tannins are apparent. Finishes bitter.",US
7604,US,"Everyday Chard, with peach and apple flavors, dry and spicy, and an angular mouthfeel. Has a density and weight that may come from mountain vines.",US
7605,US,"Strikes a firm varietal profile with apple, peach and vanilla flavors, oaky notes, and a creamy mouthfeel. It's a bit rough around the edges, with a simple, slightly sweet finish.",US
7606,US,"From a winery that's excelled at Chardonnay for many years comes this impressive wine. It's explosive in tangerines, mangoes, pineapples, cinnamon, vanilla, buttercream and toast, with a long finish of roasted hazelnuts and smoky honey. Absolutely delicious.",US
7607,US,"Santa Barbara seems to produce these exquisitely layered Chardonnays so effortlessly. The cool coastal climate has preserved vital acids, while a long growing season allowed the most extraordinary tropical fruit flavors to develop. Finally, there are the rich, creamy influences from oak and lees. This four-year-old wine shows no sign at all of age.",US
7608,US,"One of the more distinctive Chards I've had this year, notable especially for its very high acidity and mineral and lime complex. The lime tastes like a cool custard, flavored with vanilla, while the minerals bring to mind liquid steel. One hundred percent new French oak slathers it all with buttered toast.",US
7609,US,"Fruity, oaky, creamy and slightly sweet, this Chard is solidly in the international style. It offers flavors of peaches, pears, vanilla and buttered toast.",US
7610,US,"Here's a clean, low oak wine that emphasizes its fresh peach, green apple and mango flavors. It's dry, with a good grip of acidity.",US
7611,US,"Full-bodied and a little heavy. Showing apple, peach and pear flavors, generously oaked, with a slightly  sweet finish.",US
7612,US,"This is prime old-vine fruit, planted in 1972, and previously showcased in Woodward Canyon's great Chardonnays. Ripe, buttery and round, this is perfect for those who love lush tropical fruit flavors and plenty of butterscotchy oak.",US
7613,US,"Another wonderful effort from Covey Run, showing bright, spicy fruit from mostly Yakima Valley vineyards. A portion was barrel fermented and left on the lees, adding unusual complexity and pushing the wine past “simple, fresh and fruity” status. This is genuinely complex and delicious.",US
7614,US,"Napa Cabs can suffer from a soft earthiness, but El Molino has succeeded in producing a wine of real substance and style. It shows fine pear, apple and nut bread flavors, along with a figgy, raisiny quality, and has good enough acidity for balance. The finish is very dry. This complex wine should age well over the next five years.",US
7615,US,"Wonderfully leesy and complex, the second vintage of the top-of-the-line Ethos Chardonnay has intriguing streaks of orange peel and citrus zest, along with buttered nuts, toast and hazelnut flavors. All the different elements are threaded through the palate and continue into the long, silky finish. The only off notes, perhaps due to the youth of the wine, are some high-toned volatile scents and a bit of alcoholic heat in the back of the palate.",US
7616,US,"I love this Chard for its bright, brisk acidity that fires up the palate, only to reward it with ripe, delicious flavors of Key lime pie, kiwi and pineapple. Oak adds notes of buttered toast and vanilla. The result is rich, refined and complex, a Chardonnay to linger over. Easy to find, with 17,000 cases produced.",US
7617,US,"The combination of brisk acidity and perfectly ripened kiwi, tangerine and papaya fruit makes for one beautiful Chardonnay. Oak adds smoky, vanilla and buttered toast notes. The result is a captivating wine, rich and elegantly tailored.",US
7618,US,"Iron Horse joins the unoaked Chard bandwagon with this dry, complex wine. Their estate grapes are so good, the wine doesn't even need all that wood. It's elaborately tailored in pineapple, mango, ripe white peach and spicebox flavors. The vanilla and smoke, which have got to come from the grapes, add extra deliciousness.",US
7619,US,"A smashing success, this exceptional value is loaded with the typical fruit flavors of cut green apple, pineapple and melon. The fruit is set in a creamy frame and finished with beautifully restrained oak accents that support it without burying it.",US
7620,US,"Most of the grapes came from esteemed Dutton vineyards. The wine is enormously ripe. The juice was barrel fermented and aged sur lie. Creamy, packed with tropical fruit and smoky vanilla flavors, it's hedonistically delicious, but almost as sweet as a dessert wine.",US
7621,US,"It's tough to improve on Gordon Brothers' outstanding regular release of Chardonnay, a 90-point effort. All too often, the extra ripeness turns subtle nuances into thicker, less complex flavors. Barrel time adds butter and toast. So if you want a ripe, tropical, banana-and-peaches style of Chardonnay, with plenty of buttery oak, this will certainly do the trick. But somehow it seems less interesting than its cheaper sibling.",US
7622,US,"Deep gold and redolent of buttered nuts, this is made in the comfortable California style featuring barrel fermentation, full malolactic and extended oak aging on the lees. Results are predictably ripe and oaky, buttery and soft, with just a hint of baked apple acidity thanks to Washington-grown fruit.",US
7623,US,"A good and inexpensive Chard. It has plenty of peach, apple and pear flavors and oaky vanillins, and a creamy texture. Finishes with some apparent sweetness.",US
7624,US,"A simple, innocuous Chard with flavors of peaches and pears and a veneer of oak. Feels lightweight on the palate, and finishes short and a bit sweet.",US
7625,US,"Too sweet. It is unoaked, and captures the ripe, tropical fruit flavors of this appellation, but even the aroma smells like honey. Consumers have a right to expect Chardonnay to be dry, and this isn't.",US
7626,US,"This is a young, tight wine. It stuns with strong acidity and a bitter lime zest, almost gooseberry tartness. But it's nobly structured, and badly in need of a year or two in the cellar, or extended decanting. Oxygen and warming up bring out exciting notes of tropical fruits, buttercream and oak.",US
7627,US,"In an era where size is everything, a wine like this makes you appreciate true balance. It has all the rich fruit, spice, cream and oak you could want in a Chard, but maintains elegance. So easy to drink, and yet so refined.",US
7628,US,"Earthy, with an herbal, tobaccoey edge to the peach, pineapple and oaky flavors. Drinks dry and soft, with a finish of almond skin bitterness.",US
7629,US,"Lots of fruity essence in this slightly sweet, oaky wine. It has tropical fruit, peach and apple flavors, and crisp acidity.",US
7630,US,"Lots of smoky, vanilla-scented and caramelized oak has been put on this wine, but the flavors themselves are thin and watery",US
7631,US,"An easy, everyday Chard, with apricot and peach flavors and a little oak. Finishes creamy and dry.",US
7632,US,"This new winery, with excellent grape sources, jumps in with a soft, plush, buttery Chardonnay. Substantial flavors of ripe tropical fruits—bananas, peaches and melon—are melded to buttered nuts and toast.",US
7633,US,Shows some nicely ripened pear and peach flavors that are enriched with sweet vanillins and toasty oak and a hit of yeasty lees. A firm spine of acidity provides cleanliness and balance to this tasty Chard.,US
7634,US,"A supple, supremely elegant wine, displaying its diverse flavors across a fine mesh. Very pretty aromatics carry a pleasing dustiness, accented with floral, sweetly spicy high notes. The tart fruit mixes citrus, tangerine, pineapple, green apple and pear, and finishes with nicely balanced toast and butterscotch.",US
7635,US,"Very dry and a little earthy, with a dusty hay or dried straw quality to the tangerine, sweet lime, lychee, peaches and cream flavors. An interesting, crisp Chard with plenty of nuanced complexity.",US
7636,US,"As is usually the case, Bernardus's regular Monterey Chard offers lots of bang for the buck. Dry and crisp in citrusy acids, it has complex flavors of pineapple, grapefruit, kiwi, lime and spicy coconut macaroon, with delicious oak influence.",US
7637,US,"The good news is the ripeness of this wine. It's also the bad news. It's so big in jammy peach, pear and tropical fruit flavors, and so oaky, that some degree of balance has been lost. Needs a little more restraint.",US
7638,US,"It's disturbing to taste a wine so dominated by sweet vanilla and toasty char, especially when the underlying wine is as good as this one seems to be. Buried under all that wood is a crisp, pineappley and minerally Chardonnay of considerable sophistication.",US
7639,US,"Made with full-throttle Burgundian techniques, with barrel fermentation in lots of new oak and sur lie aging applied to fat, juicy berries, to judge from their ripe, jammy fruitiness. Bursts with apricot, Meyer lemon, pineapple, guava, date, fig and smoky flavors. A bit over-wrought.",US
7640,US,"Button mushrooms, clean compost and hints of toast give this wine an interesting flavor profile, but the wine turns a bit too sweet on the finish.",France
7641,US,"Rough around the edges, with dull flavors and an overly sweet finish. Sure, the price is right, but you can do better.",US
7642,US,"The cool climate has accentuated the minerality and tangy acidity of this wine, which is its basic structure. Ripeness contributes tantalizing tastes of lime and mango. To this, the winemaker has seasoned brilliantly with oak, which is smoky, caramelly, vanilla-infused and creamy. What a wonderful wine. It makes you wonder how they sell it at this price.",US
7643,US,"This interesting Chard strikes Chablisian notes in the mineral flavors that veer into apples, peaches and pineapples, and the high natural acidity. The wine trades opulence for a steely, structural elegance, and a complexity in the finish that fascinates.",US
7644,US,"Like most Chards these days, this wine is boldly flavored, oaky and rich. But it goes beyond the tropical fruits, vanilla and buttercream to achieve real finesse and elegance. The crisp acidity helps make it balanced.",US
7645,US,"This gentle, balanced and very fine wine displays consummate artistry in winemaking. It has enough fruit, oak and creaminess to satisfy that Chard craving, without any one element sticking out, and manages to be big while retaining finesse and elegance.",US
7646,US,"This single-vineyard wine has been produced for a long time. Its longevity is explained by the balance and harmony it usually shows. Soft and dry, the wine has pear, peach and buttercream flavors that finish with elegance and finesse.",US
7647,US,"This ultraexpensive Chardonnay comes down along mineral, steel and wet stone flavors. It's well-oaked,  although you'll find tropical fruit, subtly, on the finish. It's extremely elegant, with a long draw of acidity and a classic structure.",US
7648,US,"Packs as much flavor as you can fit in a glass. Ultraripe pineapples and peaches, caramelized oak, toasty meringue, vanilla, the works. Plus, it's creamy, smooth and crisp.",US
7649,US,"Super-oaky, just oozing high char and sweet caramel. Underneath is ripe tropical fruit, with a sweet finish. If you like this style, it's a good value.",US
7650,US,"Hamacher is one of the founding members of the Oregon Chardonnay Alliance (ORCA), and this wine is a shining example of what heights Oregon Chardonnay can achieve. Smoky and nutty at first, it opens to reveal white peach and melon flavors that gradually supplant the oak notes. Richly textured and full-bodied, it also boasts serious length on the finish.",US
7651,US,"Not surprisingly, this is similar to the Chards from this vineyard from Rob Talbott, which develop for a long time in the bottle. The wine is bone dry and very high in acidity, with a stony minerality to the peach and pineapple flavors. It's really too young now, but should begin to be ready by 2007.",US
7652,US,"It explodes with vanilla, buttered toast and smoke, but there's a lot of apple and pear fruit, too. The texture is creamy and the finish is spicy on this lovely, complex wine.",US
7653,US,"Completely barrel-fermented, and it shows in the wine's lavish oak, ample weight and rich, oily texture. It's nutty and leesy, and much less overtly fruity than the winery's Russian River bottling, instead focusing more on weight and texture.",US
7654,US,"Clean and varietal. The fruit tastes of ripe apples, pears, and maybe a little bit of pineapple, and if there is new oak it has been gracefully melded into the wine so it does not stick out. Just a hint of sweet toast adorns the smooth, lingering finish; then fades with a lick of butterscotch at the tail end. A graceful, elegant debut for this new Walla Walla winery.",US
7655,US,"Fruit from moe than 20 vineyards went into this three-county blend. The result is a beautiful wine. Dry and spicy, it has lush pineapple, vanilla custard, tapioca, peaches and cream and gingerbread flavors, and a lush, creamy texture. Notable also for the crisp, brisk mouthfeel.",US
7656,US,"An interesting wine that shows more complexity than you might think at this price. Blended with small amounts of other whites, it's dry and sleek, with citrus, peach, apricot and herbal-spice flavors that finish dry and crisp. Sur lie aging adds a yeasty touch.",US
7657,US,"X's basic Chard shows the bright acidity and minerality of Carneros, with ripe, savory peach jam, apple butter and tropical fruit flavors enriched with caramelly, smoky oak. It trades elegance for sheer power.",US
7658,US,"Earthy and a little sweet, a common wine that's a little too rustic.",US
7659,US,"At five-plus years of age, this Chard's fruit takes a backseat to stone, mineral and herb flavors, in addition to its original oak. It's bone dry, with crisp acids. Complex and interesting, it finishes with a dusty earthiness. Drink now.",US
7660,US,Fruit from one of the top two or three Chardonnay vineyards in Washington shows its crisp green-apple spine with plenty of toasty oak to add spice. Somehow manages to be both firm and fleshy at once.,US
7661,US,"Somewhat blocky, with round fruit flavors that show just enough crisp green apple to keep from getting mushy. Fresh, uncomplicated effort.",France
7662,US,"This winery's Chardonnays are long-lived, but that means they're tight and hard in youth. Even though this one's more than three years old, it's still high in acids and the fruit is locked down under a straitjacket of steel and minerals. Best left alone until 2007, and should hold for 10 years afterward.",France
7663,US,"Try this if you're curious what Chardonnay does when it's just starting to develop bottle complexities. The primary fruit is fading, leaving behind dried apricot, quince and peach flavors with overtones of herbs and clay. The wine is super-dry and remains high in acidity. Should hang in there through this decade.",France
7664,US,"Celilo grows some of the most distinctive and eagerly sought-after Chardonnay in Washington, and this little-known producer does a stand-up job with the fruit. Gorgeously etched with bright lime tones around fresh apple/pear fruit; good concentration, balance and length in a subtle style that shows the minerality to full advantage.",US
7665,US,"This Paso Robles-based winery has reached into cool-climate Edna Valley for their Chardonnay, with good results. The wine has good acidity and is dry and minerally, with citrus fruit flavors. Try with cracked crab and a well-buttered sourdough baguette.",US
7666,US,"Big, oaky and extremely bright, with refreshing acids and crisply defined fruit. As is usually the case with this spectacular vineyard, the flavors carry extra intensity; they seem to drill down into the heart of the palate. Though released young, this is a wine that could certainly benefit from another 6–12 months in the bottle.",US
7667,US,"Another interesting Chard from this Santa Lucia Highlands estate; why the Wagners don't put that appellation on the label is a mystery. The wine seems even higher in acidity than usual, with greater ageworthiness, and experience shows this is one for the cellar. The tropical fruit flavors are well oaked, and finish absolutely dry. Best after 2008.",US
7668,US,"The chardonnay is the largest production wine made at Barnard Griffin. It is a stellar wine, about half barrel fermented, the other half stainless; a beautiful blend of crisp, fresh, creamy, leesy, textural white peach and light citrus fruit. Consistent in style with the winery's Fumé the Chardonnay has plenty of clean acid, great fruit, and a nice butterscotch finish in the back of the throat.",US
7669,US,"The grapes got real ripe, to judge by the bright burst of yellow apricots and exotic passionfruits. At the same time, acidity is crisp and citrusy, and there's a pleasant yeasty character, like Champagne, or a nice fino Sherry. The wine finishes totally dry, leaving a palate impression of great elegance. Drink now through 2010.",France
7670,US,"This is certainly a better Chard than the winery's '04. It's richer and more succulent, overall more rewarding in varietal fruit, including peaches and cream, pineapples, guavas and papayas, with a cinnamon spice finish. The wine also is characterized by crisp, crunchy acidity that makes it racy.",US
7671,US,"Here's a dry Chardonnay, notable for its firm structure. Acidity and oak tannins provide the framework for the candied Meyer lemon, mango, floral, mineral and buttered toast flavors. There's a touch of bitterness in the finish that suggests very modest aging. Drink now through 2008.",US
7672,US,"Easily the richest of Schug's current trio of Chards, showing the elegance and crispness of the other bottlings, but with more fruity intensity. It's still a fairly restrained wine, rich in acidity and dry minerality, but rewards with pineapple custard and butterscotch flavors.",US
7673,US,"On opening, the oak on this Carneros Chard was overwhelming in smoke and char, giving the pear, Meyer lemon and kiwi flavors a woody undertow. As it breathes, it softens and unifies, but it's still a Hulk of a wine.",US
7674,US,"This is straightforward and crisp, showing apple and melon, a hint of baking spice and a tart, acidic finish.",US
7675,US,"Shows real Central Coast character in the zesty acidity that makes this Chard so bright. With jammy pineapple, Meyer lemon, kiwi and fig flavors, it also has forward oak influences. Lots going on in this fresh young wine.",US
7676,US,"Hogue's lowest-priced Chard is reliably clean fruit and appley, with firm acids and no frills. It does have some snap to the acids, a characteristic of Washington Chardonnay, and that sets it up for a food-friendly finish.",US
7677,US,"Richer than the '02, this single-vineyard Chard is crisp and bright in acidic structure, with oak and lees to add complexity. The underlying flavors suggest citrus fruits, peaches, pears, apricots and mangoes.",US
7678,US,"This first vintage of Calcaire made from Russian River Valley shows a hands-on wine much like when it hailed from Alexander Valley. Still the same heavy oak, with rich lemondrop and tropical fruit flavors. And still very tasty and drinkable.",US
7679,US,"If you love those big, rich, gooey Central Coast Chards, you'll enjoy this one. It's flamboyant in pineapple custard, lime pie, papaya, nectarine and spice flavors, and super-oaky, too, with the cool-climate acidity this appellation is known for.",US
7680,US,"Continues the Nielson tradition of lushly ripe, opulently textured Chards. It's rich in papaya and pear flavors that are swimming in toasty oak, with a creamy texture. Smooth and long, and completely satisfying.",US
7681,US,"Combines just the right amount of fresh acidity, ripe fruits and spices, and smoky oak to produce a balanced, delicious wine. Packed with powerful tropical fruits, cinnamon, vanilla, toast, even a white chocolate richness on the finish.",US
7682,US,"Ripe, tangy pineapple fruit plays nicely against rich butterscotch and maple syrup notes in this attractive white. On the palate, the flavors turn more to green apple and pear, with chalk and lemon providing tension and interest. Lively acidity supports the fruit well; although there's plenty of oak, it's not overbearing.",US
7683,US,"This mid-weight Chardonnay offers some complexity, with spicy and leesy notes accenting the apple-pear fruit. A touch of pineapple on the nose and vanilla on the palate add further interest. The mouthfeel is even, though the wine shows a bit of alcoholic heat. It finishes with good length, showing butter and spice notes.",US
7684,US,"A pretty wine, spicy and rich, with an array of vibrantly fruity flavors ranging from sweet citrus through apples and peaches to exotic mango. Winemaker bells and whistles such as barrel fermentation and lees add creamy, vanilla, buttered toast notes.",US
7685,US,"Forward in tropical pineapple and lime pie flavors, and well-oaked, this Chard has a lush, creamy texture. What gives pause is the very high acidity leading to a tart finish. Strong enough to cut through lobster, but has the firmness of structure to develop over the next five years.",US
7686,US,"This is a thoroughly modern style: 100% French oak, Dijon Clone 75, plenty of lees contact. The yeasty nose introduces a very rich, mouthcoating sensation of butterscotch. Those leesy, creamy, butterscotch flavors surround the palate; the green apple fruit carries a bit of crisp authority and keeps the structure firm. Long, smooth and very sensual without being too tiring.",US
7687,US,"The source of dependably rich Chards, Rosella's has given Bernardus the opportunity to craft a wonderfully complex wine. It's ripe in flavors ranging from lime tart and kiwi to papaya, nectarine and Anjou pear. Delicious, although it would benefit from higher acidity.",US
7688,US,"Yet another outstanding effort from Rulo, this  appealing Chardonnay marries pretty peach flavors to a mix of spices from 100% French oak barrel fermentation. Cinnamon and other Asian spices, along with barrel toast, provide a nice counterpoint to the ripe fruit.",US
7689,US,"A finish of sugary sweetness marks this Chard. It was grown in prime coastal regions, which accounts for the crisp acidity and long hangtime flavors of pineapples, green apples, Meyer lemons, kiwi fruit and spicy oak.",US
7690,US,"Desert Wind wines as a rule fall on the thin and watery side, but here the exceptional vintage has provided a welcome bit of concentration. Banana and tropical fruit are not especially rich but are reasonably persistent. Some time in new oak would have added depth to the finish, but then it wouldn't be bare naked.",US
7691,US,"Rich in well-ripened fruit flavors and with a sweet coat of smoky oak and vanilla, this Chard also has a structural integrity based on crispness and vitality. It's not a soft, creamy Chard, but a firm one, with exotic fruit.",US
7692,US,"The Reserve has always been oaky, but this may be the oakiest yet. That toasty, caramelly vanilla thing hits hard. Fortunately, the underlying tropical fruit stands up to all the wood. I like this wine, but this is about as far as a winemaker should push oak.",US
7693,US,"Here's a Chard that combines elegance and sophistication with great depth of flavor. It shows its terroir in the soft texture and well-ripened tropical fruit and peach flavors. There's a pretty coating of oak leading to a long, fruity-spicy finish.",US
7694,US,"Consistent from vintage to vintage, Three Rivers makes their Chardonnay in a soft, buttery, palate-pleasing style, showing round fruit flavors spiced up with citrus highlights. A very good value.",US
7695,US,"This tasty effort, sourced mostly from the outstanding DuBrul Vineyard, brightly combines crisp, lime-edged acidity with moderate tropical fruit flavors of pineapple, green apple and pear. Plenty of barrel spice gives it a fresh-baked apple-pie finish.",US
7696,US,This is mainstream Chardonnay. Light pineapple fruit is smothered in the buttered popcorn scents and flavors of French oak and malolactic fermentation.,US
7697,US,"Rich and ripe, this Chard brims with tropical fruit and Oriental spice flavors. It's pretty oaky, with splashy vanilla and toast notes that are perfectly in keeping with the size of the fruit.",US
7698,US,"This is yet another superripe, rich and luscious Chardonnay from Chateau Ste. Michelle. It's a tropical fruit-flavored California take on Washington terroir. Plush, smooth and plump, it nonetheless carries its weight well, with an especially fine, lingering finish.",France
7699,US,"A very limited production wine from a new Walla Walla vineyard, this was barrel fermented in neutral oak and softened up with partial malo. It leans a bit more toward the citrus/pineapple flavor side than does the winery's regular Chardonnay bottling. This is a bit crisper, with subtle grassy highlights adding some lift and interest.",US
7700,US,"From an inland appellation cooled by winds from distant San Francisco Bay. It still gets pretty hot in these parts, and the wine is simple, although it's got some pretty peach and pineapple fruit. Yet it's clean and dry, with a touch of oak, as the name implies. And it's not a bad value.",US
7701,US,"Has slight but clean wildflower and peach aromas, and drinks light but fruity, with apple and peach notes. Seems a little off-dry, but with adequate acidity. Nothing wrong with this low-priced, everyday-style wine.",US
7702,US,"A $6 Chardonnay from California? Yes, but don't expect too much. There's some decent green apple and pear fruit, okay acidity, and it's clean as technology can make it. But it doesn't rise above the level of a country-style wine. They say it was partially barrel-fermented, but it's hard to detect any oak.",US
7703,US,"Opens with watery, citrusy aromas, and tastes of apples and grapefruits. Not much complexity or depth, but it's clean, with no flaws. On the soft side, and finishes with a little residual sugar.",US
7704,US,"From one of the state's coolest growing areas comes this acid-filled, streamlined Chard. The flavors are of lime and tropical fruit, with a bracing streak of minerality. This balanced wine will be great with shellfish.",US
7705,US,"There's an elegant balance to this wine, a mellowness that's partly due to its age, and partly to the winemaking talents of Dick Arrowood. Belies its price with real richness of fruit, oak, cream, acids and lees that impress.",US
7706,US,"Peaches and cream, buttered toast, a squeeze of vanilla and a dusting of cinnamon pretty much describes this tasty Chard. It has extra layers of complexity in the balance and long finish.",US
7707,US,"Winemaker bells and whistles, such as smoky oak and creamy lees, star in this earthy wine, which has been re-released after two years. It doesn't seem at all old. There's enough peach and apple flavor to make it balanced.",US
7708,US,"The wine gleams brightly, pale gold, and the nose entices with rich scents of apples, pears and peaches. The fruit swells through the mid-palate, firm and supple, and continues with hints of hazelnut and just the right amount of buttery oak.",US
7709,US,"This is a deep gold, scented with cooked apple and pear, and showing some soft, oxidative character from extended barrel fermentation. It is quite accessible, soft and forward, with light hints of tropical fruits leading into a smooth, lightly toasty finish. Definitely a drink-now Chardonnay.",US
7710,US,"Lots of acidity in this crunchy wine; this is so tart it's almost like fresh-squeezed lime juice. Fortunately, creamy lees and plenty of new oak add softer, sweeter notes of buttered toast and vanilla.",US
7711,US,"Here's a soft, full-bodied Chardonnay that has a distinct tang of minerality to it. It's also rich in green apple and white peach flavors, with a coat of toasty oak and a lingering trace of dried herbs on the finish.",US
7712,US,"Very forward in ripe tangerine, peaches and cream, Key lime pie and Asian spices, this pretty Chard also has a coat of smoky oak. Those fruity flavors last through a long, rich finish.",US
7713,US,"An interesting Chard showing a bit of age. Picking up a nutty character, very rich and soft in the mouth, with nice oriental spice, butterscotch and ripe peach flavors. Finishes clean and vibrant.",US
7714,US,"A controversial wine with our panel. Some loved it for its idiosyncratic aromas and thick, unctuous mouthfeel, while others penalized it for the same characteristics. One reviewer's complex, hard-to-describe aroma was canceled out by another's earthy, mulchy scents. There is a solid core of peach and pineapple fruit, so on balance, our rating is positive.",US
7715,US,"Gina is a second label from the esteemed Flora Springs Winery, of Napa Valley. This wine bears much in common with FS's barrel-fermented Chards. It's richly textured, with tropical fruit flavors and a plastering of smoky, vanilla-infused oak. It was even barrel fermented. The texture is as creamy as a milkshake, and there are all sorts of dusty Oriental spices on the finish. It's a little sweet.",US
7716,US,"Polished and tasty, a nice Chard notable for its bright burst of citrusy acids. The fruit is tangerines, pineapples and mangoes.",US
7717,US,"A great value for its great big burst of juicy peach, pear and tropical fruit flavors and the crisp acidic flair of its mouthfeel. Totally dry and balanced, it shows little oak, but the flavors stand on their own.",US
7718,US,"A blend of half barrel-fermented wine with half tank-fermented, this is a ripe, fruit cocktail of a wine, blending tropical fruit with smoke, vanilla and citrus. Soft and easy to drink.",US
7719,US,"Colored a deep green/gold, this thick and viscous Chardonnay is packed with flavors of peach, apricot and tropical stone fruits. It seems Australian in its weight and fruit power, though the acids typical of Washington grapes give it some additional lift. There's just enough oak to provide a nice dusting of spice. Definitely a wine to drink young.",US
7720,US,"Chardonnay is the sweet spot in the white wine lineup (along with Riesling, of course). Big, bright and buttery, with plenty of legit oak highlights—none of this fake vanilla or microwave popcorn excess. Bacon fat, smoke and toast match the big, round, rich fruit.",US
7721,US,"Oaky, supple and structured, this sturdy Chardonnay is built upon clean green apple fruit and nicely layered toasty oak. It's the same formula as before: one third new French oak, one third malolactic, and nicely expresses open, fruit-driven, barrel-enhanced flavors with crisp citrus fruit.",US
7722,US,"The entry on this single-vineyard Chard is strangely neutral. It's not until the middle palate that a blast of sweet, vanilla-y toasty oak hits, and also pear, mango and spice flavors. From then on, it's a satisfying wine, rich and elegant.",US
7723,US,"Has the most delectable fragrance of white peaches and vanilla. In the mouth, the peach flavors are joined by powerful kiwi and pineapple. For all the fruit, the wine is dry, crisp and balanced.",US
7724,US,"Here's a full-flavored Chardonnay in which toasty oak plays side by side with big, lush tropical fruit flavors to give plenty of mouth satisfaction. There's a vanilla custard and tapioca spice flavor on the finish that's especially rich.",US
7725,US,"Here's a big, extravagant, unctuous Chard that leaves little to the imagination. Everything's oversized and upfront: the massive tropical fruit and spice flavors, the toasty, caramelized oak, the creamy, leesy texture, the finish. It's flashy, but seems to pall after a few sips.",US
7726,US,"All of this is barrel-fermented, 45% in new French oak, and it shows in the toasty, nutty scents. Buttery and creamy on the palate, with a plump mouthfeel and layered flavors of ripe pears and dried spices. Long and pineapple-y on the finish.",US
7727,US,"This cool Central Coast wine has tropical fruit and lemondrop  flavors as well as zesty acidity. Veteran winemaker Chuck Ortman has added a substantial amount of toasted oak. The result is a clean, flavorful wine.",US
7728,US,"Hints of smoke and butter accent honey, pear and apples on the nose, while toastier, grainy notes take the lead on the palate. Nicely textured in the mouth, adding hints of vanilla on the finish. Probably fading a bit; drink  up.",US
7729,US,"Well made, with a good mix of green apple and butterscotch, but less weight and density than some of the bigger wines. There's a bit of pineapple fruit also, hints of citrus and judicious use of the oak. The juicy fruit opens into light tropical flavors through the finish.",US
7730,US,"Spicy and brisk, this is a pleasing mix of crisp pear, melon and apple. The barrel time adds flavors of butter, toast and cinnamon, nicely melded. Particularly fine, stylish Chardonnay for the price.",US
7731,US,"A bit of vitamin pill aroma at first, then light herb, citrus and spice. It expands into a clean, mouthfilling, green apple-flavored chardonnay with a hint of fennel, then tails off again in the finish.",US
7732,US,"Comes down firmly on the steely, cool-climate side, with high acidity and flavors of apples and citrus fruits. Sur lies aging adds richer, creamy and yeasty notes, while oak does its smoky, vanilla thing. An interesting, complex food wine.",US
7733,US,"Long on fruity extract, rich in oak, this complex wine is packed with mango, papaya, apricot, peach, tapioca, vanilla and smoky aromas and flavors. The creamy texture is smooth.",US
7734,US,"Bigger, rounder, toastier yet stylistically of a piece with the winery's regular Chardonnay, this appealing bottling is extra soft and extra rich. The flavors are nicely balanced and creamy,  finishing with a sweet pBordeaux blend comes on with well-ripened fruit, pretty cherry flavors accented with barrel notes of kahlùa, espresso and smoke. Concentrated and smooth throughout, it is the star of this new winery's first lineup of wines.",US
7735,US,"A well-behaved Chard with a streak of minerality that uplifts the apple and peach flavors, as well as lees and oak. Finishes a bit rough and earthy, with tobacco leaf acidity.",US
7736,US,"I tasted this alongside a Chard costing more than twice as much, and it held its own. The fruit, acids, oak, spice and creamy texture come together in an appealingly balanced package. Finishes dry, long and complex, but just a tad thin.",US
7737,US,"Big, rich and extracted, this wine was partially barrel fermented, and there's quite a bit of sweet, smoky, vanilla-tinged oak—from the aromas through the long, spicy finish. Despite the bulk, it's elegant and balanced. This full-bodied, no-holds-barred white would be particularly good with barbecued shrimp served in a saffron and coconut-milk sauce.",US
7738,US,"From mountain vineyards, the peach fruit is wrapped in a tight, steely wine, with a firm tannic backbone. There are also complex crushed spices and the sweet vanilla of oak. A wine of great structure, it's also rich and delicious.",US
7739,US,"Here's a cool climate Chard with bright, citrusy acidity that boosts its tropical fruit flavors. With a smoky edge of oak, and lots of tangy spices, it's clean and refreshing.",US
7740,US,"Flamboyant tropical fruit flavors star in this polished, likeable wine. Pineapples, mangos, melons, peaches and spicy pears, with a dollop of vanilla and buttered toast, all in a creamy texture.",US
7741,US,"Joins very ripe, tropical fruits (like guavas and papayas) to vanilla-tinged, smoky oak to produce a likeable, flavorful Chard. Has a rich, almost thick, creamy texture that finishes with a swirl of spices.",US
7742,US,"There may be a little oak on this Chard, but the fruit really stars. The apple, peach and apricot flavors are perked up by crisp acidity, and the alcohol is a refreshingly low 13%. This is a good price for a wine of this quality.",US
7743,US,"There's lots of richness in this dry Chardonnay. From the peaches and cream, pineapple tart and smoky oak and vanilla flavors, to the smooth, creamy texture and the long, cinnamon spice finish, it satisfies. And look at that price.",US
7744,US,"A fresh, clean wine with lively acidity. This Chardonnay has lifted tangerine and pineapple flavors, plus a rich coat of oak that adds vanilla and buttered toast flavors. Drink now.",US
7745,US,"Big, bright and round, with a buttery, oaky mix of tropical fruits and plenty of sweet, toasty oak. Very well made in a rich, round, approachable style.",US
7746,US,"Whoa! 400,000 cases of this wine are being released, an enormous production for a Washington wine. Better yet, it's good. Smooth, plump and quite fruity, just soft enough (from partial malolactic fermentation), not too buttery, but just a hint of butterscotch. In short, it tastes like real wine, not microwave popcorn, and has some lasting power.",US
7747,US,"I like this smooth, dry wine, although it's rather overworked. The oak and lees are a bit obvious, yet the papaya and peach fruit flavors, and the acidity, are powerful enough to make it all work.",US
7748,US,"Compared to the winery's Starr Ridge Chard from the same vintage, this is unassertive. It's thicker in the mouth, and softer, with a malted, custard texture framing peach flavors.",US
7749,US,"This isn't one of your tropical fruit and oak, acidic cool-climate monster Chards. It's soft and earthy, with a dried sage and oregano edge to the green apple and white peach flavors.",US
7750,US,"A round and pleasant wine with melon, toast and pear aromas and flavors, but a bit on the sweet side. Bright citrus and peach notes add interest, a touch of chalk keeps the sweetness in check, and the oak comes up dramatically on the back end.",US
7751,US,"Lots of winemaker influence here in the leesy quality and oaky notes that have been added to an underlying wine tasting of apples and pears. The result is a dry, complex Chard that finishes with a bite of green apple acidity.",US
7752,US,"Despite its relative youth, this Virgina-made sparkler is pungently toasty on the nose, then moves into green apple and lime flavors. It does show its dosage a little, but finishes with decent flourishes of smoke, toast and citrus.",US
7753,US,"There's real consistency to Hendry's array of block-designated Chardonnays. This one shares those qualities of earthy, herbal, even tobaccoey notes along with apple and peach flavors. It shares also the dryness and softness. These are very distinct wines, and they have their place in the menu of California Chardonnay.",US
7754,US,"This pleasant wine shows all the usual Chardonnay features of well-ripened tropical fruit and peach flavors, toasty oak, and a creamy, buttery mouthfeel. It's clean and brisk, with a long, fruity finish.",US
7755,US,"You'll find some tasty apricots, peach and vanilla-oak flavors in this soft, creamy wine. It's a nice California Chardonnay, slightly sweet in the finish, and a great accompaniment to salmon or pork.",US
7756,US,"This wine shows those crisp, bright, mouthwatering Central Coast acids. They perk up the lime and tropical fruit flavors enhanced with a touch of vanilla and smoke from barrels. Finishes spicy and dry.",US
7757,US,"There's a lot of Chard character here, in the flavors of peaches, pears, Asian spices, buttery toast and cream. A large proportion of the grapes came from Monterey, which also helps explain the crispness.",US
7758,US,The understated pear and pineapple flavors of this medium- weight Chardonnay have pleasant spice accents. It finishes stylishly with slightly tart pineapple and citrus notes.,US
7759,US,"This wine's deep gold color is in line with its ripe-apple and butterscotch flavors. There's plenty of oak, and a round mouthfeel. Sophisticated palates may find this package just too obvious, but tangy oak over overtly sweet fruit is a bulls-eye if you're not seeking nuance.",US
7760,US,"Rich and ripe in pineapple, mango, vanilla, spice and buttered toast, a smooth, succulent wine that finishes long and spicy. A tad soft and simple, but polished.",US
7761,US,"Nice and rich in toasty oak, framing mouthfilling flavors of pineapples, papaya, peach and cinnamon spice. Feels creamy-smooth, with a good tang of acidity.",US
7762,US,"Crisp and dry, a minerally wine with earthy, citrus flavors and a firm structure. For a little richness, there's a streak of peach on the finish.",US
7763,US,"Soft and oaky, this is a simple Chardonnay with more than its share of buttery oak. Flavors are cracker, toast, buttered nuts; there is little impact from the fruit.",US
7764,US,"Quite different from Spelletich's Spotted Owl release, this wine has spiced green-apple aromas. While it's as rich in flavor as the other offering, the acidity is lower, so the wine seems softer and creamier.",US
7765,US,"Cream and honey aromas highlight this juicy, fleshy wine. With its buttery texture and slightly sweet fruit flavors, it's about pleasure, not complexity, and it finishes long and spicy.",US
7766,US,"Subtle citrus and peach aromas mark this pretty wine, with light oak shadings. It's round and supple, with some nicely extracted citrus fruit and crisp acidity. It's light and elegant, but no blockbuster.",US
7767,US,"This Sonoma County Chardonnay is a mainstream success, with ripe, peachy fruit, leesy notes and not that much oak. It finishes dry, clean and crisp, with a slight bitter-almond note.",US
7768,US,"A zesty, vibrant Chard, filled with acids, with flavors ranging from ripe citrus to peach. There's very little oak, so the fruit and crispness star. Long, spicy finish, and terrifically food-friendly.",US
7769,US,"Ripe and juicy in mango, pineapple and pear flavors, with a generous dollop of toasty oak and a vanilla cream texture. Finishes a bit sharp in acidity, but refreshing and tasty.",US
7770,US,"Tight and lemony, with firm acids that make the tastebuds whistle. This is a dry Chard well suited to crab dishes.",US
7771,US,"So much richer than the '03, and a really nice example of Edna Valley terroir. The wine is brilliant in acidity, giving it an uplifted, bright mouthfeel. The flavors of kiwi, tangerine and smoky oak are delicious.",US
7772,US,"A pure, monstrous expression of Napa Chard, this vintage of Ovation exudes quality. Fragrances of acacia and lilac accent the rich, toasty nose. A no-holds-barred wine with huge amounts of pear and peach fruit, banana, coconut and vanilla. One of America's heftiest Chardonnays, it's pumped to the brim with buttery oak. Yet all along the way it holds onto its balance. If you like 'em big and creamy, this is for you.",US
7773,US,"A rich and complex Chardonnay, bursting with tropical fruit, ripe peach, vanilla, fig, apple, toasty oak, and spice aromas and flavors. Notable for its texture—round, thick and creamy, almost honeyish. Finishes very long.",US
7774,US,"A tight, young, flinty wine, full of earthy richness, and with a solid core of tropical fruit, ripe peach, and fig flavors. High acidity makes it lively. The finish is earthy and dry, but rich enough to suggest a few years of cellaring.",US
7775,US,"Normally we don't remark on a wine's color or clarity, but this one is a throwback: rich golden-yellow and cloudy. Heavily toasted whole-wheat bread couples with earth and custard aromas, and then the lemon and tangerine flavors hit you on the palate. Finishes with some elegant lemon and clove notes.",US
7776,US,"Quite a bit more steely and structured than Fritz's regular Dutton Ranch bottling. Has strong green-apple and pear notes; pretty and harmonious. The fruit is ripe and spicy, and it's got enough oak trimmings to satisfy but not overwhelm.",US
7777,US,"Oak and tropical fruit are highlights of the aroma, which also includes buttercream, vanilla and a leesy streak. Flavors are dominated by toasty oak, with butterscotch, vanilla custard, and crème brûlée wrapped around a solid core of apple. For fans of big-boned, sweet Chards.",US
7778,US,"Vanilla, ripe pear and dry citrus aromas and flavors highlight this featherbed of a wine. The palate's soft, almost sappy feel, round melon fruit and mild spices are easy to like. It's not cloying or tacky, just don't look for spine or structure.",US
7779,US,Lime and other citrus fruits predominate in this lean and tangy wine that's a refreshing relief to the multitude of oversugared and overoaked wines in this category. There's a faint spritz on the palate and the citrus profile makes up for slightly low acidity. Finishes mild and even.,France
7780,US,"The pineapple and Golden Delicious aromas are right on target, and are followed by apple and mildly oaky flavors. An easy texture and smooth finish with mild spice notes close this crowdpleaser.",US
7781,US,"This wine has a flinty, minerally personality, with a full  overlay of toasty oak. Don't look for fat, blockbuster fruit here—the flavors tend toward lime and tangerine. The oak adds caramel, vanilla and smoky notes. It's supple in the mouth but closes strangely flat.",US
7782,US,"Unusually tropically, even for California Chard. Big time flavors of ripe, juicy papayas and mangoes that are well oaked. Tasty, but a little syrupy-soft.",US
7783,US,"Very oaky, with a blast of char and caramel. Under that is light fruit suggesting pineapples and pears, in a creamy texture.",US
7784,US,"Clean, dry and oaky, with modest flavors of peaches and pears, and a good finish. A good value.",US
7785,US,"Simple and earthy, with peach, pear and sweet oak flavors, and a slightly rough mouthfeel. Finishes with an awkward sweetness.",US
7786,US,"Has real Monterey character in the ripe tropical fruits and zesty acidity, only the flavors are a bit thin. If you can find this wine for a few bucks less, it's a real value.",US
7787,US,"There's lots to like in this everyday Chard in a box. It's not just the price, because the wine is dry, crisp and fruity, with plenty of creamy Chardonnay character and a refreshingly clean finish.",US
7788,US,"This stylish, opulent wine is marked by an array of ripe fruits, ranging from citrus through peach, apricot and mango, and is lavishly oaked, with a rich, creamy texture and lots of smoke and toast on the nose.",US
7789,US,"Has lots of lemon, peach and green-apple aromas, with a pungent earthiness. Fairly well-oaked, with pretty citrus flavors and a spicy, rich liveliness. Fun and easy to drink.",US
7790,US,"From a region not known for Chardonnay, this is toasty and pear-tinged. It's a tad heavy, almost honey-like and brooding. The oak is pronounced, but it frames the fruit. A wine of individuality and earthiness, but also atypical.",US
7791,US,"Crystal-clear California Chardonnay, with its trademark pineapple, pear and citrus flavors offset by a hit of creamy oak and buttery notes. Toast and butterscotch marry with faint lemon flavors on the finish.",US
7792,US,"Light and friendly aromas of green apple, pear, vanilla and slate. Apples and pear flavors are touched up by a slight nuttiness. Finishes a bit heavy, with oak and toast stepping on and over the fruit. Full acidity keeps it tight.",US
7793,US,"Offers up complex apple, lemon peel, and even caramel aromas, along with some spicy vanilla. The apple flavors are accompanied by spicy, butterscotchy oak, although the flavors could be more concentrated. A friendly, likable wine.",US
7794,US,"Ripe tropical fruit, bananas, some heat still, and roughness from the barrel fermentation. It needs some time to smooth out, but it's a very consumer-friendly style of Chardonnay. Best Buy.",US
7795,US,This lemony wine boasts modest citrus aromas and flavors coupled with sharp acidity. It has some pretty oak and spice notes.,US
7796,US,"Opens with aromas of peaches, butter cream, vanilla and caramel, then turns fruity and rich in the mouth. It's a bit awkward, as there's a blast of herbs or veggies in the middle palate that doesn't seem to belong.",US
7797,US,"Very ripe, forward fruit characterizes this slightly heavy, somewhat dense wine. It has a kiss of oak and a little sweetness, with good, crisp acidity.",US
7798,US,"Smells citrusy and oaky, with a distinct melon note. This is a simple, somewhat rough wine that expresses the most basic Chardonnay characteristics, but offers little beyond affordability.",US
7799,US,"Begins with aromas of peaches and citrus fruits and a vegetal, herbaceous note. Fruity and rough, with good acidity.",France
7800,US,"Here's a dry Chard marked by creamy lees, oak, and an array of yellow and red tree stone fruits. It's a little soft, with a creamy texture. Will go well with food.",US
7801,US,"A little thin on the finish, but bright in perky acidity. The fruit on this dry wine veers toward Key lime, lemons and vanilla.",US
7802,US,"The vineyard is in the northeastern Salinas Valley, in the Gavilan foothills, which makes it a cool climate. The wine has adequate acidity and oak, with flavors of peaches and cream and a rich, honeyed finish. Could have more depth and complexity, though, especially at this price.",US
7803,US,"As with the reserve, the house style is to make a soft, lightly buttery, very approachable wine. Nice light tropical fruit flavors are a blend of mango, pineapple and banana. There is nothing heavy-handed about the oak, it's nicely layered into the background.",US
7804,US,"Complex, with pears, sweet grass, apples, citrus, jasmine, and chalk all apparent on the nose. Creamy and full in the mouth, like a good milkshake. Some toast notes come on at the end.",US
7805,US,"Emphasizes oak-derived elements—toast, cream and hints of menthol—backed up by pineapple and other tropical fruits. A big, hefty mouthful.",US
7806,US,"Estate bottled and barrel fermented, with lots of buttery flavors from full malolactic fermentation. Intensely fruity, it retains some acids, and shows a good clean mouthfeel and a persistent finish.",US
7807,US,"This is sensuous Chardonnay that provides plenty of texture and depth without being heavy. The bouquet is robust and complex, with pear, smoke, vanilla, cumin and an appealing oatmeal-graham cracker-like note. A full spectrum of similarly ripe fruit flavors coats the mouth, bolstered by good acidity, and you can almost sink your teeth into the full, chewy mouthfeel. This very impressive bottling finishes long and complex, with grainy pear, spice and buttery notes. Editors' Choice.",US
7808,US,"An intensely fragrant floral, ginger, peach, lemon-lime and orange-spice bouquet ushers in this smooth, well-structured wine. The palate shows intricately meshed orange, butterscotch and toasted nut flavors, offset by angular, racy mineral accents. Finishes long and crisp, with refined pineapple, citrus and stony flavors. Enjoyable now but still tight, this should offer even more in two years.",US
7809,US,"This Napa stalwart is beautifully integrated. Leesy and citrus notes accent the solid apple and toast profile on both the nose and in the mouth. It's big, but displays impeccable balance and a great mouthfeel. Lime and spice play against richer butterscotch, vanilla and toasty elements on the long, handsomely textured finish.",US
7810,US,"There's plenty of ripe fruit in this 1998. An intense nose of coconut, jasmine, sweet pineapple, toasted marshmallow and cloves opens this lush beauty. A lovely, positive tension prevails in the mouth between tropical fruit flavors, pear, apple and citrus elements, all accented by intriguing spice notes. Finishes long, again relying on a fine tension between sweet and tart notes to create a harmonious and sensuous close.",US
7811,US,"Taut and intensely structured, the compact smoke, lime, ginger and nut bouquet here hints at what's within. The mouth offers lime and chalk, vanilla and apples and a creamy yet firm mouthfeel—it's surprisingly full, with bright acidity. The dry, crisp finish with its spicy, toasty flavors has great length, again showing structure and refinement. Will be at its best in two-plus years. Cellar Selection.",US
7812,US,"The flagship of the Peter Michael Chardonnays is a stylish, sexy wine. Opens with a wonderful nose of peach, tropical fruit, nuts and orange tea; it shows great poise and a classic sense of proportion from bouquet to finish. The wine unfolds and expands in the glass, offering lovely orange, mineral and tarragon flavors. The engaging finish has great length and subtle aromas and flavors. Impressive for its restraint and attention to detail, this is delicious now but will also reward keeping. Cellar Selection.",US
7813,US,"One of seven wines we tasted from this renowned vineyard, and one of six from veteran Chard-meister Jed Steele. This one's a beauty—the top scoring wine from both the winemaker and the site. A floral, orange, vanilla custard and almost mustardy-spice nose opens to a full orange, mineral and vanilla-spice palate. It's rich and creamy yet spicy, and even shows some bright lemony elements. This multidimensional wine finishes long with tangy, toasty oak. Top Value.",US
7814,US,"This is everything a flagship wine should be, with its rich mouthfeel, palate-coating flavors and long finish. The flavors are on the apple side of the Chardonnay spectrum, with toasty oak galore, but would you expect otherwise? The long finish has lots of finesse and style despite its considerable heft.",US
7815,US,"This is a seductive pleasure-bomb, with a ripe core of tropical, citrus and banana fruit flavors wrapped in a toasty-oak and butterscotch cocoon. Lush and creamy, it hits all the right notes; as it pushes the ripeness and vanilla envelopes to the max, it does so with great style and balance. The long, toasty, crème brûlée finish has great appeal. Top Value.",US
7816,US,"Ripe orange and papaya, spice, graham cracker and smoke are a few of the adjectives tasters used to describe the nose of this delightful wine. Though rich and open on the palate, it never gets loose or sloppy. A great chalk element and spice accents nicely offset the rich fruit foundation. Buttered toast and nutty, leesy notes mingle with pineapple on the long, finely balanced back end.",US
7817,US,"Full and focused, the nose of orange, crème brûlée and vanilla opens to a handsomely balanced palate of lively citrus, Granny Smith apple and vanilla cream flavors. Moderately plump and pleasing, good underlying acidity here keeps it elegant and maintains fine flavor definition. Butterscotch, lemon and spicy oak flavors mingle on the long finish.Top Value.",US
7818,US,"One of the oldest wines submitted, a deliciously complex créme brûlèe, coconut, nutmeg, vanilla and smoke bouquet opens this classy contender. Full and creamy on the palate, it offers rich, finely nuanced pear and nectarine fruit flavors accented by clove, nutmeg and coconut. Still feels young, finishing long and bold with intriguing spice and tangy pineapple notes.",US
7819,US,"Deep pineapple and orange fruit is wrapped in a deep, toasty oak envelope in this Russian River classic. There are complex nutty, leesy, burnt sugar and even vaguely meaty notes on the nose. These open to a big-bodied but earthy and stony palate where bright, citrusy fruit and vanilla accents also vie for attention. Tightly wound, the burnt-toast and mineral finish is long and tasty, with more vanilla, smoke and apple accents. Top Value.",US
7820,US,"This Chardonnay reads on the nose and palate like key lime pie. Sweet and sour citrus notes are offset by graham cracker, vanilla and ginger snap. This is great juice with plenty of dimension—at once smooth and full, creamy and spicy. Don't drink it for dessert, though—try it with grilled chicken in a citrus and spice marinade. Top Value.",US
7821,US,"A winning nose offers aromas of créme brulée, smoked bacon, pears, peaches and toasty vanilla that just keep coming on in this stylish, full wine. The palate shows similar flavors. The big mouthfeel continues on the long, slightly sweet finish with its toasty, smoky oak. Strong already, but it should be even better in six months. From the maker of the fine affordable and widely available Katherine's Vineyard Chardonnay. Top Value.",US
7822,US,"This wine's fat, tropical fruit, banana and toast nose has a pungent, spicy Gewürztraminer quality. The palate is the payoff. It shows the aforementioned elements, plus cinnamon, clove and vanilla flavors. What you get is a ripe, unctuous wine—big, maybe even a bit overblown, but totally lovable. The long, spicy finish of this unique bottling is impressive.",US
7823,US,"A seductive nose of pineapple, pear, vanilla and buttered toast leads, followed by a nicely knit, well-fruited, but not-at-all sweet palate. Here, pear, melon, pineapple and tangerine is offset by light toast and vanilla accents. Balanced and smoothly textured, it shows graceful restraint that suggests it will improve over the next year or two.",US
7824,US,"Lots of spice along with a veritable fruit cocktail of complex flavors open this understated performer. From green apple and bosc pears to melon and mint, it has an elegant integration of fruit and spicy, vanillin oak. Tangy acidity keeps it lively, and the wine finishes crisp and dry. Still tight, this could use a year to knit itself together.",US
7825,US,"A winning combination of pear, apple, ripe melon and butterscotch flavors, spiked with spicy clove and tart citrus accents. Lavishly oaked for a mid-weight wine, there's sufficient depth of fruit here to support the wood, and the elements mesh and hold nicely. An easy, lush mouthfeel means it's best enjoyed over the next year or so—if you can keep it around that long.",US
7826,US,"This is a big, delicious mèlange of pineapple, pears, buttered popcorn and coconut vying with mineral and toasty oak elements. Fat and friendly, it's got the goods to hold the taster's interest. The “California Cuvée” designation means that it's made of fruit from many places—more proof that good bottles are not all vineyard designates or single AVA wines. Enjoy now and over the next two years.",US
7827,US,"An anise note adds dimension to an already attractive lime, toast, melon and buttery bouquet. With beautiful balance, subtle peach, nut and crème brûlée flavors come together in a very attractive palate. This is as lithe and balanced as a ballerina on pointe. This Rutherford treat has a long, warm and smoky-caramel flavored finish.",US
7828,US,"At 2,523 cases, this is fabled grower Rochioli's largest-production Chardonnay. The bouquet sings with complex roasted nut, pineapple, citrus, toast and banana aromas. Tart apple and anise flavors play off the sweet caramel and vanillin oak to create an elegant balance on the palate. Persistent fruit and smoky accents on the finish—it's hard to resist. Top Value.",US
7829,US,"It's said that Dick Arrowood personally checks every bottle that goes out—his attention to detail shows here. A complex and refined bouquet of toasted oat, coconut, orange and peach opens to a full palate of apple, yellow plum and caramel flavors. Rich and creamily textured, it is also high on spice and smoky oak. The complex finish is very long, leesy and elegantly nuanced.",US
7830,US,"Creamy smooth, dry and crisp with acids, this wine shows modest peach and coffee flavors, accented with a touch of smoky oak.",US
7831,US,"Light style, that hints at butterscotch, with clean and transparent flavors. The fruit is elegant and pleasant, but seems overmatched by the alcohol.",US
7832,US,"Shows proper Chard character in the peach flavors, oaky overtones and creamy texture. Could use more concentration, though, as it's rather weak on the finish.",US
7833,US,"Dilute and thin, with only the vaguest hint of green apple for fruit flavor. There may be some attempt to add buttered popcorn-style oak flavoring, but it doesn't really add much.",US
7834,US,"What a wonderfully complex, satisfying wine. It combines the steely acidity the vineyard regularly contributes with massively ripe tropical fruit flavors to produce a real stunner. Rich in mango custard, key lime pie, pineapple sorbet, vanilla pudding and smoky oak, it has a crispness that makes the flavors sing. Best in its youth, and should hold for a good five years.",US
7835,US,"It's fun to compare this to the winery's Ramal Vineyard bottling. This is tighter still, a young, crisp, minerally Chard, racy and elegant in pineapple, mango and buttered toast, with the high acidity associated with this vineyard. It's a fine, complex wine now, and should hold for at least five years, possibly longer.",US
7836,US,"Smells fresh and fruity, with ultraclean apple and peach flavors, and not much oak. Nice flavors in this pretty wine. It's dry, with typical Chard fruit and spice, and a kiss of oak.",US
7837,US,"There's plenty of apple, melon, and citrus fruit in this dry, stylish wine. Has a nice earthy streak that hits midpalate, then turns ripe and generous on the finish. It's a little on the simple side, but it's pretty good for the price.",US
7838,US,"From some of Monterey's best growing regions comes this light but likable wine. The racy flavors veer toward tropical fruits and citrus, and while it's a little on the simple side, the wine is clean and spicy. Fairly high acidity gives it a bit of a tingle.",US
7839,US,"This is a nice, clean wine that has more fruit and class than you'd think at this giveaway price. The aromas and flavors tend toward green apples and peaches, with some pretty oak shadings. The finish is a little sweet.",US
7840,US,"It smells of apple pie, pears and spearmint. Tastes of pineapple, green apple and oak. Some residual sugar lends a fruit-cocktail element to a wine that shows its best when well chilled. As it warms up it begins to get sticky on the palate.",US
7841,US,"Apple and pear aromas, and some subtle oak shadings, mark the aromas, while the flavors are of green apples, peaches, and citrus fruits, with a spicy finish. But it's watery in the middle, with scouring acidity.",US
7842,US,"The nose is welcoming, with aromas of buttered toast and spice. But the flavors are overwhelmingly lemony and tart—a strange amalgam that doesn't quite come together.",US
7843,US,"Hints of the bright tropical-fruit aromas the Salinas Valley is known for emerge, but they're accompanied by earthier notes. A real bite of acidity creates a sharpness that some residual sugar can't quite soften. As a result, it seems a little unbalanced and disjointed.",US
7844,US,"Long known for their powerful, elegant Chardonnays, Chalk Hill's 1998 offering is impressive for its complex array of aromas and flavors. The toasty, leesy, popcorn elements adorn full, richly nuanced sweet pear, pineapple and peach flavors. A lovely, smooth mouthfeel with a slight granular quality adds texture and interest. This refined wine exudes finesse and refinement.",US
7845,US,"A winning wine that displays a vibrantly fragrant tangerine, citrus and herb-butter bouquet. It opens to a full, dense tropical-fruit palate and shows an almost seamless texture. Tangy oak plays off the lingering fruit nuances on this bottling's lengthy, luxurious finish.",US
7846,US,"One of a back-to-back pair of strong performances from Foley, this wine opens with well-defined herb, caramel and cream nose. Ripe apple and toasted oak flavors round out the rich, buttery palate. The citrus and peach finish goes on forever. Shows complexity, but with a straight-ahead style that make it a real pleaser. Great now.",US
7847,US,"Bob Lindquist's 1999 offering displays a lovely opening of tropical fruit and vanilla custard beneath a smoky veil. The palate's understated nectarine, pear, pineapple flavors are bolstered by firm but not sharp acidity. The mouthfeel is crisp; the wine's fine structure shows through the tangy, nut-pepper finish. Already impressive, but warrants cellaring for two or three years. Top Value.",US
7848,US,"An intoxicating bouquet of clove, ripe orange, peach and melon promises a lot, but this wine delivers. The similarly heady palate of creamy, ripe tropical fruit is almost romantic, the richly textured mouthfeel full and lush. Finishes long in the same sensuous manner. Drink now for its exuberant fruit and voluptuous feel. Like Paul, his wines exude style and character.",US
7849,US,"The ripe bouquet shows rich banana, butter and pineapple aromas. Full-bodied, yet bright with lively acidity, the palate displays bright citrus, butterscotch, pineapple, green plum and vanilla flavors. There's slight heat, but also nice vanilla and citrus notes on the long finish.",US
7850,US,"A seductive nose of pineapple, pear, vanilla and buttered toast leads, followed by a nicely knit, well-fruited, but not-at-all sweet palate. Here, pear, melon, pineapple and tangerine is offset by light toast and vanilla accents. Balanced and smoothly textured, it shows graceful restraint that suggests it will improve over the next year or two.",US
7851,US,"This is a full, round and juicy wine, with pronounced orange, tangerine and pineapple aromas and flavors. Wonderful hints of vanilla and spice accent the bright tangy core of citrus fruit. A wine that's big and packed with fine ripe fruit, but isn't over the top.",US
7852,US,"Bright pear, peach, pineapple, ginger snap and floral notes grace a fresh, fragrant nose. The palate's exotic tropical fruit, ginger and lychee nut flavors mingle beautifully in a medium-full, though perhaps slightly sweet, package. Elegant and appealingly fresh.",US
7853,US,"A very ripe tropical-fruit nose is complemented beautifully by an intense smoky-toasty element. Pineapple, mango and caramel flavors stand out on the full palate: The smoky note resurfaces later, riding out the persistent finish. This is a sleek, stylish, but very solidly built Chardonnay. It pushes all the right sensory buttons, with big body and great lines, like a '56 Buick.",US
7854,US,"Joseph Phelps's flagship Chardonnay is a study in sophisticated style. A fragrant peach, pineapple, smoke and floral bouquet might, in other wines, be overpowering, but here it is subtly seductive. Rich peach, tart orange and oat flavors ride the velvety palate, and the long, suave finish displays tangerine, peaches and cream aromas and flavors. There are layers of nuance to explore here—savor this one slowly.",US
7855,US,"From the orange, creamy buttermilk and earthy notes on the nose to the dry mineral, herb and Asian pear palate, there's much to savor here—such as the balance, proportion and long, citrus-mineral finish. This is a complex and reserved wine, not a conventional, in-your-face bottling. It's rather tight now, but if you give it two years (or more!), you'll be well rewarded.",US
7856,US,"The third vintage of the Beringer senior winemaker's namesake bottling is robust, yet approachable. This wine is lavishly—to some, overly oaked, but it's one of the best of this style. Apple, cinnamon bun, and smoke aromas give way to caramel, vanilla and spice flavors. Add a rich, round mouthfeel, and you've got a very seductive package. This wine is more about vigorous style, flavor and texture than subtlety. Only die-hard anti-oaksters will be able to resist its appeal.",US
7857,US,"Another elegant wine from Cambria. This one has a vanilla, smoke and grapefruit nose. Medium-weight, it is crisp in the mouth, though somewhat leaner than the Bench Break. This cuvée nicely melds green apple fruit with menthol and vanilla accents. The bouquet is a reprise of the long, sweet-tart, butterscotch and tangy oak finish.",US
7858,US,"Crème brûlée creaminess combines with tart citrus fruitiness in this wine, which displays great balance and richness. A nice oak frame holds it all together and provides a handsome framework for the lime-orange-tangerine citrus core. The palate has buttery caramel and wintergreen accents. Long, serene finish.",US
7859,US,"Full and fat with a delightful mix of tropical fruit and new oak spiciness. Both a creamy texture and good acid—a feat in itself—offset nicely the rich pineapple, peach, coconut, clove and exotic spice flavors. Has style, balance and length. Drink this Carneros champ now and over the next two years. Top Value.",US
7860,US,"Best known for their classic Cabernets, this producer has a confident and skilled hand with Chardonnay, too. This is a well-proportioned wine that displays complex apple, lime, vanilla and earthy mineral notes. There's a crisp tautness to the apple fruit and tart citrus acidity that carries on the long, spicy finish. A powerhouse that promises to open up over the next year. Top Value.",US
7861,US,"Taste this wine and you'll agree: It's big. Even fat. A fragrant, buttery apple-floral bouquet opens into a banana, orange and hay palate. The mouthfeel is creamy, round and lively—it's full-flavored without being too weighty. Pear and butterscotch linger on the finish.",US
7862,US,"Aromas of smoke, cream and herbs atop a ripe pineapple foundation. In the mouth, pineapple prevails again along with apple, toast and butterscotch notes. It's supple, and though quite fruit-driven, it's not at all sweet. The wine shows complexity and finishes long and light on its feet. Top Value.",US
7863,US,"Aromas of butter, cream and popcorn are so prevalent on the nose that you'll swear you're at the movies. Popcorn and butter show again on the palate, but here they're teamed up with ripe golden-apple and orange notes. Finishes with pineapple and butter in bold and appealing style. A daring, not gently nuanced, wine.",US
7864,US,"This plush Chardonnay's bouquet shows an ultraripe botrytis note in its vanilla, peach, clove and caramel aromas. Dried fruits, caramel and honey flavors massage the palate: the mouthfeel is full and viscous—even voluptuous. A must for lovers of larger-than-life Chards.",US
7865,US,"A tart pineapple-lemon nose with caramel and smoke accents ushers in a full palate. Apple and pear flavors add body, and a chalky note contributes complexity and texture to the palate. Slight creaminess provides a fat, full feel, but maybe just a bit more softness than some tasters preferred. Still, this is a solid wine with finesse and body. It displays both smoky toast and bright orange-lemon notes on the finish.",US
7866,US,"The graceful, subtle nose of pears, apples and hazelnuts don't prepare you for the richness of this old-guard Napa producer's 1999 offering. A full and intense palate of toast, honey, spice and pineapple comes on strong. The flavors are supported by bright acidity, and they linger on the long and lively finish.",US
7867,US,"Butter and vanilla wrap around tropical fruit and citrus flavors on the full nose. Baked apples, crème caramel and abundant new oak merge to provide this chard with a slightly viscous, buttery texture. Its rich butter and oak may be a bit too much for some. The tangy finish is long and tasty.",US
7868,US,"This appealing Chardonnay is the same wine that carried a reserve designation in prior vintages. It's lushly woven and has aromas and flavors of pear, pineapple and peach. The fruit is rich but not overly sweet, and sports accents of cinnamon and allspice. This balanced, medium-weight wine finishes long and easy with a nice nuttiness. Top Value.",US
7869,US,"A jazzy bouquet of sour pear, toasted nut and leesy notes opens this North Coast winner. An unusual mix of dry orange, papaya and cantaloupe flavors follow on the palate. The medium-full mouthfeel is butter-smooth, yet bright and crisp enough to not be mushy. Spice and lemon accents enliven the long, tangy finish. Top Value.",US
7870,US,"This Napa Valley aristocrat sheds its normally understated demeanor and shows lively, pear, apple and melon fruit plus a vanilla-custard richness. There's toasty oak and a lively acid backbone that will help it evolve over the next few years. It's well-balanced, with a toasty, poised finish that's long and has bright lime overtones.",US
7871,US,"In this fine offering from one of this tasting's most consistent performers, a nutty, pineapple-ginger nose opens to a lively mouth of citrus, hazelnut and spice. The feel is firm, elegant. This handsomely constructed wine finishes long with subtle white peach notes, with dashes of tangy spice and chalk.",US
7872,US,"Lots to like in this affordable Chard, with its bright flavors of tropical fruits and apricots and brisk acidity. Finishes smooth and a little sweet.",US
7873,US,"A clean, high acid style, showing pineapple/citrus fruit flavors and light touches of fresh green herb.",US
7874,US,"It's odd that while the alcohol here is lower than on the winery's Rancho Santa Rosa bottling, the wine tastes hotter, with a pepper spice note that actually complements the ripe, exotic tropical fruit, pear and buttercream flavors. This is a very big, complex wine, long-lasting in the finish and impressive for the way its mass is balanced and contained.",US
7875,US,"At nearly 16% alcohol, this is one of the biggest Chards I've ever had. It's totally dry and explosive in all sorts of late-picked, effusively ripe pineapple custard, lemon drop and apricot, caramelized brown sugar and cinnamon. A wine like this is an achievement anywhere, and while there are those who will object to its size, it is certainly delicious.",US
7876,US,"Ginger snap and graham cracker aromas share the field with golden apple, menthol and lemongrass on the nose. Winemaker Rob Hunter selects the best lots and crafts a tightly-meshed wine with persistence and a strong backbone. Pear, pineapple, vanilla and toasty oak linger on the palate. Has personality and closes with impressive length.",US
7877,US,"Another solid effort from Mondavi, the 1998 reserve shows fine structure and an attractive spectrum of citrus, peach, crème brulée and nut aromas and flavors that work in lovely harmony.  It's full but not heavy, and balances fruit and acidity, sweetness and tartness, and light and full elements. The positive fruit, style and restraint are notable.",US
7878,US,"This is a ripe pear-scented butterscotch-infused Chardonnay. The palate shows more ripe pear and melon flavors, along with lots of toasty new oak, which yields delicious hazelnut shadings. Soft and easy to enjoy, it closes long, and creamy-spicy.",US
7879,US,"This is a unique wine with an unusual and impressive bouquet of peach smoke, cocoa and hazelnut. Balanced but firm on the palate, it offers robust fruit and spice flavors and mint, toast and nut accents. There's even an intriguing kirsch-like cherry note in here. Full-bodied, it's a wine of real individual character that finishes dense, long and spicy.",US
7880,US,"The fragrant and flavorful nose's butter, lychee and banana aromas create an alluring opening. Pink grapefruit and tropical fruit flavors accent a sweetly spicy, baked-apple mouth that has medium weight and a nice texture. The wine finishes dry and nutty, with moderate length. Smoky and lush, it's ready to drink tonight.",US
7881,US,"A flamboyant bouquet of pineapple, ripe orange, floral, nuts and toasty oak opens to a full palate of orange, nectarine and pineapple flavors. Interesting accents including brown sugar, buttered popcorn and mineral notes provide great tension against the fruit. Round and full—if a touch soft—it closes with a long, refined spicy-nutty finish.",US
7882,US,"Apple and tropical fruit aromas accented by mint, grass and herbal notes open to an equally bright palate of pineapple, mango and citrus flavors. In this classy, medium-bodied Chardonnay, these lively elements meet buttery vanilla notes in the mouth and flow into a long caramel finish with brisk, pepper-oak accents.",US
7883,US,"Big and oaky, as Private Reserves always are, the '99 is a textbook toasty Chardonnay. Apple, peach and plum aromas and flavors are wrapped in a smooth, smoky cocoon. The rich and supple palate feel is a winner, the long finish still tight. Enjoyable already, but should be held for a few years.",US
7884,US,"Intriguing Asian spice, peanut brittle, pineapple and butter cream aromas comprise the bouquet of this round, well-integrated wine from Sonoma County's tiny Green Valley appellation. Everything flows smoothly into the lingering pineapple, butterscotch, pear and apple flavors in the finish. Top Value.",US
7885,US,"This Chardonnay, from a small vineyard block in Jess Jackson's Alexander Mountain estate, is grand yet graceful. Oozing pear, butterscotch, melon and menthol flavors, it shows good weight and a positive richness that's supported by firm structure. It's balanced, appealing, admirably not overoaked and finishes long with flavors of melon, spice and pear offset by toasty accents. Top Value.",US
7886,US,"This seductive, creamy Chard wraps smoky, spicy, vanilla-laden oak flavors around a core of lush tropical fruit. There's lively acidity and a lot to like here. The finish shows a slight edge that may smooth out in another three or four months.",US
7887,US,"One of two Byron bottlings from this source; this one should be less difficult to find in stores. The dry apple and pear fruit flavors are bolstered by crisp acidity, refreshing mineral accents and earthy elements. This is a chewy, mouthfilling wine with richly textured palate feel. The long finish is tangy with citrus, cinnamon and mineral components.",US
7888,US,"Jed Steele's wines turned in impressive performances in this tasting—as in this full-bodied, well-integrated and elegant wine from the respected Sangiacomo Vineyard in Carneros. Tropical fruit, butterscotch, lemon and hops flavors caress the nose and palate, supported nicely by an acid spine. Creamy yet firm, the mouthfeel is admirable. The wine sports a stylish, mildly spicy finish. Top Value.",US
7889,US,"Fine flavor definition and very good acidity. Citrus, apple and herb aromas sing on the nose. Round apple, anise and pineapple show on the velvety palate. The wine finishes with a pretty melding of pineapple and vanilla, like an elegant tropical creamsicle. Enticing, but still tight enough to warrant holding it for a year or two.",US
7890,US,"Like autumn in a bottle, the subdued smoke and pear bouquet is followed by a buttered apple, toast and vanilla palate. The flavors are more understated than they sound—this wine is all about subtlety and balance. It builds in layers, complex and butter-smooth. The standout finish shows butterscotch and mineral notes in a delightful tension.",US
7891,US,"A pale gold color belies the full, deep aromas and flavors this wine offers. The lively, multifaceted nose highlights orange, pear, ginger snaps, anise and caramel notes. It opens to a rich, even palate that shows similar flavors and a smooth, buttery feel. The pleasing finish displays plenty of toast, vanilla and spice, and an impressive dry, leesy aftertaste.",US
7892,US,"Four different clones are separately fermented and then blended to make this unique bottling. An expansive nose shows vibrant pineapple, peach, and orange fruit with lemondrop and butterscotch accents. It's rich and mouthfilling, like a bite of banana cream pie, and turns maybe a bit orangey-sweet. Shy on subtlety, it packs in a lot of juicy flavor.",US
7893,US,"Apple, pear, coconut and chalk mark the bouquet of this smooth yet crisp and brisk wine from the Napa microproducer. Lime, pineapple and apricot with oak and cinnamon shadings are in play on the rich, viscous palate and flow beautifully through to the finish. Though full, the wine never gets weighty. It closes light on its feet, long and tangy, with lemon, cream and oak accents.",US
7894,US,"If you like piña coladas and getting caught in the—oh…I mean…coladas and ripe banana, caramel and pear aromas and flavors, then this wine delivers. There's an undeniable coconut quality here, and nice acid zip that keeps the fruit in the mix. The oak tannins need a bit of time to smooth out—they're a little edgy on the back end.",US
7895,US,"Heavy clove and cinnamon-spice notes grace the nose of this very limited single-vineyard offering. Honey, stone and a nuttiness mark the nose. Ripe and lively pineapple, banana, lime and grapefruit flavors shine nicely in a medium-weight, well-balanced style. Finishes long and tart. A year or two in the bottle will bring out more complexity.",US
7896,US,"A pear, apple-orange and earth bouquet sets the stage for a palate chockful of pineapple, pear and lemon flavor. Toast notes offset and vibrant acidity uplifts the fruit nicely. The finish is long and tart-sweet with complex leesy, earthy notes. Medium-bodied and restrained, this complex wine shows depth. Give it six months to a year to unfold.",US
7897,US,"The rich bouquet shows buttery, creamy vanilla notes with hints of tarragon and sweet hay. Golden apple and pear wears sweet butterscotch on the medium-weight, soft palate. Shows a bit of alcoholic heat as well as good intensity and impressive weight, but a one taster found it too controlled by vanillin oak qualities at the expense of the fruit.",US
7898,US,"Fermented with native yeast, this estate wine from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir pioneer Josh Jensen is classy, earthy and firm. Apple and yellow plum flavors mingle with mineral elements on the palate. It finishes nutty and tart, with good length and a solid acid spine. One of the few California wines that are Burgundian in spirit, this is still tight. Although it was one of the oldest wines we tasted, it can still use a few years to fully unfold.",US
7899,US,"Helen Turley's Chardonnay shows nice complexity, particularly on the nose, where nuanced oriental spice, tobacco, nectarine, floral and yellow fruit aromas play with the senses. The palate is mild and balanced, with melon, stone fruit and nut flavors, and a smooth texture to boot. Just a touch of heat shows on the long, dry yet spicy finish.",US
7900,US,"With its 90% Napa and 10% Sonoma lineage, this wine serves up mild lime, butterscotch and green apple aromas and a nicely weighted palate with tropical fruit, peach and caramel flavors. The mouthfeel is soft, with a caramel custard quality. The long, creamy and toasty finish will win raves from lovers of both the full malolactic and well-oaked styles.",US
7901,US,"Tasty hazelnut overtones to the apple and cinnamon aromas mark the nose of this elegant wine. Toasted almond, pear and caramel flavors work in harmony. Good acidity and all-around stylish restraint make it a great food wine.",US
7902,US,"Pear, pineapple and citrus aromas with spearmint accents comprise the bouquet of this Russian River favorite. The wine is round and soft with tea, lemon, tropical fruit and buttercream flavors. It's light- to medium- weight, but with enough complexity to hold the taster's interest, and a persistent, tangy, sweet and sour back-end fade.",US
7903,US,"Complex leesy, smoky, nutty aromas adorn the nose of this racy wine. It displays a citrusy tartness and lime, green apple, vanilla and wintergreen accents that linger refreshingly. Finishes with unusual apple, nut and burnt sugar aromas and flavors. A Mendocino appellation wine from Jim Clendenon, the notorious ‘Mind Behind' Santa Barbara County's Au Bon Climat Winery.",US
7904,US,"This opens with a muted but very pleasing nose of orange, pineapple, clove, almond and baked apple aromas. The palate's tropical fruit is complemented by butterscotch, clove and allspice flavors. Soft but well-constructed, it's a medium-weight wine with balanced fruit and well-utilized oak on the finish.",US
7905,US,"The price is right, but this wine is rather skimpy in fruit, over-oaked and too sweet.",US
7906,US,"Heavy and thick, like canned peach syrup, with too much oak and sweetness.",US
7907,US,"Not much going on. Clean and dry, with watery flavors of apples and oak.",US
7908,US,"There's a rich streak of mineral that undergirds tremendous ripe tropical fruit, along with crisp acidity and a good amount of smoky oak that's perfectly integrated with the rich fruit. Tremendous extract and weight and a long, impressive finish make this wine addictively good.",US
7909,US,"This enormously ripe wine shines with a purity of tropical fruit and candied citrus flavors that are generously oaked. But for all the richness, a penetrating acidity cuts through and makes the wine finish clean. Drink this Burgundian-style Chardonnay soon for its youthful opulence.",US
7910,US,"This is hefty, dry and structured Chardonnay. Offers a complex musky, creamy nose that ushers in a range of tart citrus, coconut, toasted nut and mineral flavors. The smoky finish also shows a crisp, almost hard-edged metallic note. Stylized and appealing, but still tight—should be better in a year or two.",US
7911,US,"Aromas of ripe cantaloupe, vanilla and tropical fruits plus creamy malolactic notes show on the nose of this limited-production Napa Chardonnay. This offering, a distinct label from the proprietors of Far Niente, has apple, pear and white peach flavors. Expect caramel and nut accents on a smoothly textured, buttery palate. The finish is long and dry—you'll see a reprise of the nutty elements plus a hint of lime.",US
7912,US,"Announces itself with an unusual and pleasant Gewürtztraminer-like tangerine, lychee and ginger nose. Its mild but decidedly unique character is clearer on the melon, butter-cinnamon and peach palate. Nice acidity and a tangy-spicy finish.",US
7913,US,"In good vintages, Trefethen reserves a special portion of their Chardonnay production for late release in their Library Selection series. This latest offering—one of the oldest wines tasted—shows good balance and creamy, yet still crisp, smoothness. The green apple fruit is still holding well, along with a chalky note and a refreshing lime, herb and flinty tartness reminiscent of Chablis.",US
7914,US,"Refined and inviting, the bouquet offers caramel, hazelnuts and toast. Dark apple, toast, spice and earth flavors fill the mouth. The mouthfeel is rich and dense, though a touch more fruit would really have it singing. Finishes with spice and faint lime notes, and a toasty oak flavor that really takes over. The former Deutz Champagne estate in San Luis Obispo County, Laetitia is now devoted to producing Chardonnay and Pinot Noir.",US
7915,US,"This Carneros Chardonnay shows solid mainstream style. Apple, caramel and mint aromas on the nose open to apple, coconut and menthol-oak flavors. The mouthfeel is full, though some tasters thought more big than full. Toasty new oak takes the lead, and a touch of heat shows on the back end.",US
7916,US,"Notes of smoke, toast, lime and herbs play against guava, pear and brown sugar scents in the bouquet. A chalk note accents zesty orange, grapefruit and guava flavors and a soft mouthfeel. Vanilla, clove and oak highlights mark the wine's creamy, medium-length finish.",US
7917,US,"This is an impressive bottling with complex caramel, toasted nut and tropical fruit aromas. It's big bodied and coats the mouth with rich butterscotch, banana, apple and toasty oak flavors. A touch short on acid, it could use bit more backbone, but it's still big on toasty style. Its long, satisfying finish is an oak lover's paradise.",US
7918,US,"This big, brawny Chardonnay's potent nose of smoke, hay, orange, banana and pungent lees is an attention-grabber. Baked apple, buttered popcorn, and vanilla flavors come on strong along with an edge of spicy oak that carries through the finish. The panel rendered a split decision on this wine from veteran winemaker David Ramey. It showed harmony, length and finesse to some, but appeared edgy, a bit disjointed and obvious to others.",US
7919,US,"This blend of 35% Sonoma, 33% Santa Barbara and 32% Monterey grapes shows the intensity and depth of flavor that careful grape selection and knowledgeable blending can achieve. The wine is full and forward, with mango, pear, pineapple, popcorn and very toasty oak boldly coating the palate. Just a touch unsubtle, it's still very delicious, and finishes with butterscotch and nutmeg.",US
7920,US,"Tastes like harvest in Hawaii. Toasted marshmallow, coconut and sunny tropical fruit notes hula on the opulent nose. A medium-weight palate of rich and warm, very comfortable flavors—apple cider, spice and earth—follows. A tangy, spicy finish makes you wish it were a touch longer.",US
7921,US,"Rich opening aromas of pineapple, pear and lime plus toast and leesy accents open to a round palate of sweet pear, apple, vanilla and pineapple flavors. This nicely balanced, medium-weight wine is smooth, but the new wood really dominates the lengthy close.",US
7922,US,"Thyme and lavender notes mingle with orange, tangerine and banana aromas and flavors in this exotic, stylized wine. An ample dose of spicy new oak brings dimension, but also adds a dry, slightly austere note to the long finish. Appealing now; may integrate better with short-term cellaring.",US
7923,US,"The green apple and menthol toast bouquet shows some unusual tobacco-like aromas that are usually associated with red wines. A sip reveals mint, apple and caramel flavors on a full, oaky frame. Nicely balanced and still tight, it ends with slightly subdued but persistent caramel and toast flavors. Previous vintages of this Santa Barbara classic have performed well—often better—after cellaring. Try in two years.",US
7924,US,"A presently reined-in wine with exotic elements, showing a ginger, saffron and green apple bouquet. It's well-balanced, with lively apple and citrus flavors. It has good acidity and a firm structure that should hold it together for three or four years. With aging, it may integrate and develop further.",US
7925,US,"The bouquet is like an aromatic walk in the woods—it has pine, earth and floral elements as well as the expected fruit aromas. Red apple and plum flavors are accented by lemon-lime the mouth, and a mineral note asserts itself. It has body but not weight, and closes with a clean citrus-chalk finish.",US
7926,US,"Very ripe tropical fruits and appealing pear, apple and spice notes show well in this nicely balanced wine. Good acidity plays a solid supporting role here. The toasty oak holds the almost overripe fruit in check—it's strong from the mid palate through the handsome butter-and-apple finish.",US
7927,US,"This barrel-fermented Chardonnay shows smoky new oak and telltale matchstick leesy aromas. Real spiciness comes through on the palate. The apple fruit wears strong clove, nutmeg and butterscotch notes. There's a firm acid backbone that's lively, but slightly jarring to some tasters. Give this one four to six months to knit itself together.",US
7928,US,"The complex smoke, earth, spice and mineral aromas that open this wine are followed by subdued tangerine and citrus flavors, dried spice and mineral accents on an oaky frame. Like the other Mt. Carmel Vineyard offerings, this is a bit tight now but has a promising, good balance. Not a fruit-driven wine, this finishes long with spice and mineral elements. Only 86 cases produced.",US
7929,US,"Opens with a lovely bouquet of lemon and tart pineapple fruit with anise, mineral and tobacco accents. The lemony note resurfaces on the pear, white peach and green apple palate. A chalk element adds interest and balances the overall zingy, bright tone in this tangy, high-alcohol wine.",US
7930,US,"Mint, fresh fruit and decidedly floral aromas led to yet another split-decision wine you may just have to taste yourself. Some tasters found elegance, white stone fruits, citrus and good acidity leading to a rich, silky finish with buttery and nutty notes. Others (same bottle!) found it soft, sweet and a bit cloying in a “your auntie's perfume” manner. Strange, but true…we can't make this stuff up.",US
7931,US,"This estate vineyard wine's complex nose melds mineral, spice and lime aromas with herb and floral notes. It handles the disparate elements gracefully, showing body but not weight, and has a soft, almost tender mouthfeel. There's a touch of floral sweetness in the mouth—as on the nose—offset by earthy, mineral flavors on a lithe frame. This wine shows real subtlety, but leaves us wishing for more depth. Finishes light, dry and flinty.",US
7932,US,"A lively citrus tang balances the rounder fig, melon, toast and dried spice flavors that predominate here. Finishes evenly with medium length. It seems to be at its peak, so drink this round and well-integrated Chardonnay up now.",US
7933,US,"Smooth and creamy from start to finish, this wine is a dead-on mainstream pleaser. Begins with a nutty and toasty nose that also shows traces of apple and lemon. The palate, buttressed by a healthy dose of oak, also offers a lot of fruit flavor, including pear and lemon, without being overly sweet. The bouquet's creamy and nutty notes reappear on the supple back end.",US
7934,US,"A touch of mint graces the tropical fruit-laden nose of this respected Monterey bottling. Fruit driven yet taut, the orange, pineapple, apple and herbal notes here show an earth-and-mineral complexity without the common overt oakiness. If you are fan of less-overtly oaked wines, this is a medium-weight, stylish offering with personality and fine balance.",US
7935,US,"This is a good, oaky Chardonnay for those who like their Chards bright in acidity and fruit. The flavors veer toward ripe pears, buttered toast and sweet herbs, but have an earthy undercurrent.",US
7936,US,"This Chard showcases the Hills' wonderful mélange of ripe tropical and citrus fruit and crisp acidity. Add to that the complex toast and vanillins of the barrel, and the result is eminently drinkable. Enjoy this unctuous Chardonnay early before that babyfat melts away.",France
7937,US,"Attractive pear, citrus, melon and mild spice aromas open this lean and elegant wine. The mouthfeel is light, but not insubstantial and slightly tense (in a good way), showing good acid spine, crisp citrus flavors and taut mineral accents. A slight creaminess keeps it from getting too sharp, and it closes with a nice chalky note. Has the stuff to keep and may well merit a higher score with a few years of aging.",US
7938,US,"Susie Selby's homage to her late father has some sulfur and earthy notes on the nose, but there's good fruit behind. This full-bodied, nicely textured Chardonnay has nutty, smoky and spicy flavors melding with tangy tropical fruit to create a tasty, fairly lush wine that's easy to enjoy. Finishes soft, with a faint whiff of petrol—in the Alsace manner—and is drinking well now.",US
7939,US,"Aromas of movie popcorn, hops and Asian pear open this rather over-the-top wine. It's a decidedly candy-sweet combination of butterscotch, peach and nut flavors with a soft, round mouthfeel. The light orange finish is easy. If you have good friends who just don't like dry wines, this is a great one to serve them.",US
7940,US,"Citrus, pineapple, white stone fruits and green apple are among the aromas and flavors in this clean, medium-weight offering. The wine has a nice butterscotch streak, but some tasters found it light to the point of insubstantial, while others praised its balance and elegance.",US
7941,US,"Smoky, heavy toasted oak complements mild tropical fruit, nuts and coconut on the nose. The toasty flavor and a decidedly earthy note reads big against the pineapple, citrus and rich vanilla notes showing in the palate of this even, medium-weight wine. Finishes dry, brisk and slightly tart.",US
7942,US,"The bouquet offers dazzling aromas, including pineapple, banana, cinnamon, nutmeg, roasted nuts and butter. On the palate, the wine becomes more focused: taut pear, citrus and golden apple flavors closely wrapped in a tasty butterscotch and toast cocoon. Finishes long and even; could still use six months to a year to unwind.",US
7943,US,"The historic estate's 1998 is characteristically lean, angular and fairly closed. The bouquet of apple cider, anise, and fragrant jasmine-like notes opens to a trim palate of green apple and toast flavors, and a taut mouthfeel. Tart apple and oak, plus a flinty, mineral element play on the finish. Notoriously tight when young, this wine often opens incredibly with cellaring.",US
7944,US,"Tasters pegged apples, anise, crème brûlée and cinnamon in the lively nose of this rich wine—one that also sparked some controversy. The straight-ahead flavor profile is appealing, with solid apple, clove and butterscotch offset by the attractive anise streak. But is it native yeast or heavy malolactic fermentation that's responsible for the mixed feelings some panelists expressed? Concerns were noted about a dairy-like note on the nose and also a slick, yet gummy texture. Nevertheless, the winning aromas and flavors kept the overall take positive.",US
7945,US,"Another one of Jed Steele's many single-vineyard offerings this wine from Santa Barbara is big and perfumey. Pineapple, banana and caramel flavors are cloaked in sweetness that may be a bit heavy for some.",US
7946,US,"Restraint and elegance are not what you usually find in a Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay, but this one offers tart apple, citrus, and peach flavors along with a dose of toasty new oak. Clean and understated style.",US
7947,US,"We enjoyed the vanilla, pear, butter and toasty flavors on this classy Chard, but the high alcohol it contains almost does it in. The nice acid backbone holds it together though and leaves a good overall impression. Enjoy it with grilled seafood.",US
7948,US,"Lavishly oaked from the first whiff on the nose and palate, dense toasty notes envelope the pineapple and tropical fruit. Plenty of vanilla and both a tangy nuttiness and a creaminess from the oak, provide a nice mouthfeel tension. Panelists had two schools of thought about this wine: The oak totally dominates—certainly now—and how you feel about that determines your take on the wine. Lacking fruit? Or just tight and needing a year or two to open? Only time will tell.",US
7949,US,"This sunny, medium-gold wine opens with caramel and apple aromas. More candy apple-like flavors appear in the mouth, accompanied by tropical fruit and toasty accents with a rich caramel tone. It verges on too-sweet, but it's nonetheless pleasing in an uncomplicated way.",US
7950,US,"This light and elegant wine opens with orange and mild tropical fruit aromas. Easy peach and pear flavors bear dry vanilla and toasty oak accents. Even and soft on the palate, the nutty-leesy-chalky finish brings the wine to a pleasing close.",US
7951,US,"Pear, pineapple and herb aromas intrigued some tasters, but others found an odd note in this wine's nose. Vanilla, pear, apple and sweet spices mark the medium-weight and round palate. The back end of this wine has tangy wood and a slight chalkiness.",US
7952,US,"This Chard displays a slightly unusual but appealing sweet and sour streak. The bouquet shows tart green apples, grapefruit, stewed fruit and sweet herbs, plus tangy green oak shadings. The palate delivers more of the same, with zingy citrus and crisp apple flavors, but also dry, leesy notes. There's both cream and pepper on the back end of this likeable, split-personality wine.",US
7953,US,"The bouquet of Farrell's wine is a mixed bag of buttered popcorn, minerals, herbs, citrus fruit, pineapple and melon stuffed in an oak envelope. Similarly attractive flavors mark the palate, which is fairly full and has an almost rustic quality. Has all the body and length you could want, if not quite all the balance and finesse.",US
7954,US,"Some very appealing apple, asian pear, mint, smoke and toast notes mark the nose of this even, medium-weight wine. It has fine fruit-to-acid balance and offers apple-peach flavors with a mild but evident butterscotch element. The tangy oak that's present from the start shows most prominently on the spicy finish.",US
7955,US,"A full and creamy bouquet announces a palate laden with ripe golden delicious apple, vanilla, and melon flavors, with chalk, mineral and earth elements. The dry finish carries some length and builds in intensity. A straightforward wine that's ready to drink right now.",US
7956,US,"This Napa Valley mainstay's offering shows a firm acid backbone and crisp, bright green apple flavors with lemony accents. Overall a bit on the lean side, but it shows just a hint of butteriness and some tangy new oak spice on the long, tart finish.",US
7957,US,"The full fresh-bread aromas of yeast, honey, oats promise much body, but the palate delivers a dry citrus-mineral mouthful of flavors. Mouthfeel is dry and briskly acid—but with a nice chalky note, too. Chalk shows again on the finish, where it somewhat checks the sharp lemony-metallic notes.",US
7958,US,"Big and easy with caramel and creamy notes to spare, this has good apple, spice and toast elements and an appealing nutty-leesy aspect. Still, it seems already quite mature, like it needs to be drunk now. Enjoy it soon for its full mouthfeel and ripe baked apple flavors.",US
7959,US,"From the smoky, spicy nose through the spicy apple notes in the mouth, this bottling has an intriguing earth and mineral streak from start to finish. Medium-bodied, the wine offers some lemon and mineral tang and a lot of smoky oak on the finish.",US
7960,US,"This very rare, single-vineyard Chardonnay has distinct vanilla, golden delicious apple, banana and peach flavors—a nice mix of sweet and sour, but some tasters found searing acidity and a sharp metallic note. Finishes tart, dry and long with a bracing edge capable of cutting right through your fried calamari and spicy sauce. Only 132 cases produced.",US
7961,US,"A big nose of toasty oak, vanilla and butterscotch opens this offering. There are hints of pear and apple fruit, but the palate has a dominating oakiness and a custardy fatness. It's slightly hot, with dominant butterscotch and vanillin oaky flavors.",US
7962,US,"Respected vineyard source and established record of the winemaker notwithstanding, the dense gunpowder/matchstick quality here isn't easy to take—or even read. It is stylized, and big (we can sense suppressed tropical fruit and earthy, mineral notes below the veneer). Hidden treasure…or just rough stuff?",US
7963,US,"Rusack turns to two vineyards, including Bien Nacido, for their reserve Chard, which is richer and finer than their regular county-wide botting. It's a nice Chard, but a bit young and angular now. The parts are there for a rich, creamy, tropical fruit and mineral show stopper to emerge. Give it until late 2006 and into 2007.",US
7964,US,"What's so interesting about this Chardonnay is the dryness and the earthy minerality. There are flavors of dried herbs and dried fruits, such as apricots, lemons and pink grapefruits. Usually these Dijon clones produce enormously fruity wines, but this fine wine has a sleek, high-acid Chablisian elegance.",US
7965,US,"The pleasant nose of nuts, green apples and caramel also shows an odd whiff that mattered more to some tasters than others. Light apple fruit, spice, earth and butterscotch notes play on the full, but vaguely sour milk-tinged palate. Finishes tart and dry with slight mineral notes, in the manner of some white Burgundies. We've been big fans of Foxen's wines in the past, but this one left us scratching our heads.",US
7966,US,"This wine cuts a racy Chablis-like profile. Green apple and lemon-lime fruit, mild spices and a dry earthiness are all in play here. They ride on brisk acidity through a tart and minerally finish. A thoroughbred wine that, to some, “lacks stuffing.”",US
7967,US,"Some panelists praised this Chardonnay's balance and zingy citrus flavors; others were put off by its potent, even overwhelming, oak and green woody aspects. It's full-bodied, and there are pleasant pear, lime and butterscotch notes fighting for space on the palate. Give it a year or two and judge for yourself.",US
7968,US,"The nose here shows clean pine and citrus notes, with accents of herb and tropical fruit. Straightforward apple, pear and nut flavors show on the palate. In some ways, including the nutty finish, the wine is good—in other ways, it's just there.",US
7969,US,"Slightly odd-scented nose with hints of pipe tobacco, grapefruit, green apple and herbs. Better on the palate with green pear, faint apple, pineapple and herbal notes in a tart, lean framework. Pleasant hints of oak show up on the finish.",US
7970,US,"The nutty, smoky notes on the nose are overshadowed by taut, high-octane alcohol-mineral scents. The stony, mineral-laden palate also shows earthy, apple-oatmeal flavors. The mouthfeel is full, yet tight (we could say ripe, but it's not fruit-driven wine). This unusual offering fades long but closed, with hints of spice and coffee. Previous tastings of Mt. Carmel have proved it a tough read when young. Hold and taste in three years.",US
7971,US,"The nose here delivers a hefty dose of meaty, smoky, nutty notes paired with mild pear and apple. The palate doesn't show complexity—a pronounced toasted oak rides hard on apple and pineapple fruit. It's balanced and finishes dry, but comes up wanting the desired texture and nuance.",US
7972,US,"Lean and tautly balanced, this wine has an outdoorsy, mineral-and-hay bouquet and sweet herbal accents. Green apple flavors take over the palate, though hints of lemon and minerals also show up. Tasters didn't find anything terribly wrong here, just a lack of element that would make it more right. Finishes with lingering oaky notes.",US
7973,US,"Crème brûlée and baked apple aromas on the nose open to a smooth palate of mild apple, pineapple and spice flavors with citrus accents.The flavors aren't vibrant, though, and the intensity of the oak rendered the faint fruit nearly invisible.",US
7974,US,"There's still a good and pleasant dose of pineapple and apple fruit accented by vanilla spice in this wine, but a mature and overly soft palate-feel suggests that it's best consumed near-term. Finishes smooth and light, with medium length. Drink up this year.",US
7975,US,"Opens with a nice nose of roasted nuts, banana, caramel and a hint of smoke. The palate's pear, baked apple and apricot flavors wear interesting coconut accents, but all these are unfortunately overrun by a scotch notes peek out from behind an edgy acidity.",US
7976,US,"The deep gold color here suggests age, as do the soft, vaguely oxidized flavors. Still, it shows some nice vanilla and baked apple notes, as well as slight chalk accents, on its toasty oak frame. Drink now.",US
7977,US,"Asian pear, but also dairy-like notes of cheese, sour cream and show on the nose. The mouthfeel is a bit heavy. Apple and woody flavors show on the palate; dry wood and spice mark the back end. A good wine, but now reading ponderously—perhaps past its prime.",US
7978,US,"Offers an attractive nose of white peach, pear, lime and anise, but fails to come through with much substance on the palate. Simple and buttery-slick in the mouth, it shows some spicy notes but not much else, and turns a bit hot on the finish.",US
7979,US,"Drinks tighter and steelier than PR Chards of the past, and there's a lot of acidity, and even a dusting of tannins in this big, young wine. Bone dry, the minerality is enriched with white peach, honeydew  and oak flavors. Few California Chardonnays benefit from aging, but this one will. Best from 2007 through 2009.",US
7980,US,"Comprised of 100% estate-grown grapes and barrel fermented in new French oak, this is Woodward Canyon's premier Chardonnay. The richness of the oak almost overpowers the nose, but when one thinks of premier cru Burgundy it's hard to tell the difference. In the mouth, the fruit more than holds its own, with firm acids and plenty of ripe peach and apricot flavors. Additional time in bottle is needed to soften the hard edges. Just 143 cases made.",US
7981,US,"A firm, structured yet smooth rendition with flavors of melon, red delicious apples and light tropical fruits. Crisp acidity, creamy lees and light hints of toast.",US
7982,US,"Beautifully defined fruit flavors—peaches, pineapple and mango—are supported with buttery, nutty oak and rather firm skin tannins.",US
7983,US,"Intense aromas of apples and pears start things off, and in the mouth the wine strikes just the right balance between intensity, crispness and full-flavored opulence. Good fruit, good acids, a pleasing creaminess, and an extended finish that lingers cleanly through flavors of toast and butter. Best Buy.",US
7984,US,"This top-of-the-line Chardonnay from Columbia Crest gets extra time in barrel and bottle, and comes from the much-heralded 1998 vintage. It's a rich, creamy style, with less obvious buttery oak than the Grand Estates, but more complexity and a thicker, more complex feel to it. Flavors mix fruit, wood, spice and herb evenly. It has a comforting feeling of weight to it; it's not just up-front, aggressive flavors. Editors' Choice.",US
7985,US,"Nicely dry, crisp in acidity, and with apple flavors streaked with a stony minerality, this Chard offers clean, everyday pleasure.",US
7986,US,"The core of this no-oak wine is medium-ripe fruit in the apple/pineapple mode. But a bitter, harsh aftertaste throws it off course, and it never recovers.",US
7987,US,"Dry, earthy and a little simple, this Chard has flavors of herbs, pears and oak, and is soft in acidity. For another two dollars, you're better off buying Beaulieu's beautiful Carneros Chardonnay.",US
7988,US,"From the Oak Knoll area, this is a super-oaky wine, bursting with vanilla and char. The underlying fruit isn't really big enough to sustain it, though. The wine is earthy and soft, leaving the oak to dominate.",US
7989,US,"The vineyard's characteristic green apple and light melon flavors are here, though lighter and more ephemeral than in the over-the-top 2003. Nice hints of cinnamon are scattered throughout, and the finishing oak flavors carry an impression of slightly burned crème brûlée.",US
7990,US,"This is a fine companion wine to Hogue's less-expensive “regular” Chardonnay. It shows the same luscious, tropical/citrus fruit flavors, the added layers of caramel and vanilla, the spicy finish. Just a bit more punch and power to it, and along with all that, a certain youthful tightness that suggests another half-year of cellar time is in order.",US
7991,US,"Mature and full bodied, with caramel and crème-brûlée aromas. The even, rich mouthfeel has a creamy texture. Tropical fruit, spice and caramel flavors on the palate extend into the finish, where a dry, chalky note and the underlying acidity come up. Lovely now.",US
7992,US,"Even at three-plus years, this Chard still tastes young and tight. It's perfectly dry, with high acidity and an earthiness that covers citrus and peach flavors. It will never be a big, over-the-top wine, but it's a fine one that should develop additional complexities over the next five years.",US
7993,US,"This junior version of Rusack's reserve is ripe in tropical fruit flavors and well-oaked, and the acids are bright and clean. Shows lots of sophisticated cool-climate Santa Barbara character at a fair price.",US
7994,US,"The Grand Estates is CC's midpriced offering, and the Chardonnay sees plenty of oak and sur-lie aging. Rich, toasted-nut aromas underscore firm apple and pear fruit. The custardy texture is a treat. Best Buy.",US
7995,US,"Hogue makes a full line of Chardonnays and calls this least expensive bottling their “fruit forward” version. Although that's true, there's more to this wine than simple fruit. There's fruit aplenty, to be sure, but other layers of flavor interest as well: vanilla cream, caramel and cinnamon spice. Best Buy.",US
7996,US,"This excellent Chardonnay is both crisp and smooth, with ripe, lemony green apples augmented with hints of custard and vanilla. It has both weight and balance, and should cellar well for the near term. But why not enjoy it now?",US
7997,US,"Here again is fine, rich, ripe fruit, mostly pears and peaches and bananas, layered and textured. The flavors build through a full, delicious middle, with some nice creaminess from barrel fermentation. What's missing is the pleasing toast of new oak, which would etch the fruit into a bit more focus. A hint of residual sweetness rounds out the finish. Best Buy.",US
7998,US,"Flat, disjointed and aggressively oaky flavors all but cover up the hints of tropical/pineapple fruit. There's an undertone of gummy plastic through the finish.",US
7999,US,"Wineglass Cellars is a boutique producer whose focus has been on red wines; this, notes winemaker David Lowe, is their first Chardonnay that's “serious.” It takes the crisp structure of Washington fruit and adds a healthy dose of new oak, giving it plenty of toast, spice and vanilla. It's a winning combination, and sure to please. Just 277 cases made. Best Buy.",US
8000,US,"The apple, earth and mild tropical fruit aromas, good mouthfeel and apple-pear and caramel flavors are all right on target. Lockwood's largest volume bottling, this hits all the right notes. Toasty, spicy oak mingles with apple, spice and butterscotch on the close. Drink now.",US
8001,US,"Smooth apple-pear and buttery, toasty aromas open to like flavors. That fruit core is offset by mild mango accents and lots of spicy oak, which continue through the long finish. For fans of rich, oaky full-bodied Chardonnay.",US
8002,US,"This is a well-made, balanced effort with green apple fruit enhanced with hints of honey and allspice. Still quite young and tight, it is just beginning to soften up and show some nice toasted, roasted nuts in the finish. It isn't quite as intense as the Barrel Fermented Chardonnay from CSM; this is a slightly softer, more approachable wine.",US
8003,US,"Bright entry leads to a softer midpalate. A change in style from previous years, more approachable, less acidic, with more obvious flavors of buttered nuts and popcorn. The smooth, soft, slightly soapy style may be a welcome change for some palates, but I miss the old snap and sizzle.",US
8004,US,"Very soft and buttery, made in a style sure to reach out to a broad base of consumers looking for accessible flavors with lots of oak and tropical fruit. The style feels more Australian than Washington, but it fits in nicely with the winery's expanding lineup of single-vineyard and reserve Chardonnays.",US
8005,US,"From the Pisoni family, a crisp, fruity Chard that's long and deep in jammy apricot, lemon drop and guava flavors that are set off by high acids. This is a big, in-your-face wine, but it has some fine complexities.",US
8006,US,"The name honors one of the founders of the original winery, and the wine generally mixes buttery fruit with a blast of oak flavor. It's burly, bold and aggressive; subtlety is not its strong suit. But in this price range, for the oak-lover in the crowd, it's a great choice, ready to drink right now.",US
8007,US,"Columbia Crest makes three Chardonnays, of which this is the least expensive. It boasts assertive, somewhat herbaceous aromas of peach and spice; the fruit is clean, forward and zesty. It displays a lot of character in a vivid style that showcases Washington's  intense fruit and lip-smacking acids.",US
8008,US,There's not much going on with this thin Chard. The watery flavors and absence of fruit emphasize the acids and alcohol.,US
8009,US,"This is a very nice, stylish Chardonnay that's good in varietal character, yet balanced and elegant enough not to blow away any food it accompanies. Dry and crisp in acids, it shows citrus, peach and apple flavors that finish clean and zesty.",US
8010,US,"Showing the high, brisk acidity this region is known for, this dry wine has modest peach and pineapple flavors and some smoky oak. Feels like sur lie aging played a part too, to judge by the creaminess. This pleasant sipper gains complexity as it warms in the glass.",US
8011,US,"DDO's Chardonnay comes as close to white Burgundy as you will find in Oregon. Amazing finesse, with crisp, detailed aromas mixing flowers, peaches, melon and almonds. Impressive texture and a long, elegant and precisely-detailed path across the palate.",US
8012,US,"Here's an intense, nervy wine, brilliantly acidic, layered and rich. It has enormous lemondrop, mango and pineapple flavors and lots of smoky, vanilla-accented new oaky notes, and is creamy in the mouth. The finish is long, lush and spicy. This is a real palate flatterer.",US
8013,US,"From a venerable Burgundian producer comes this earthy, spicy wine, with a body and texture that are unctuous and creamy. There's a whole fruit basket here, with everything from green apples to peaches to tropical fruit. What's harder to express is the wine's power to satisfy. Rich and lush, it swings for the bleachers and just misses, but it's a solid triple. Editors' Choice.",US
8014,US,"Ripe and racy, this single-vineyard wine has lots of sweet lime, white peach and kiwi aromas and flavors on top of a steely framework of crisp acidity. Oak adds buttery, creamy notes. A rich, complex combination.",US
8015,US,"Yummy. Exotically rich, ripe fruit marks this expressive, polished wine. Apple, peach, pear, vanilla, and toast highlight the aroma, and it drinks extravagantly rich without being over the top. The finish is complex and harmonious.",US
8016,US,"Made with fully ripened grapes, this is a lush, complex, thoroughly enjoyable wine. It's fairly dry by California standards, but offers up masses of sweet fruit and oak extract. The balance is especially nice; all parts are in harmony. Editors' Choice.",US
8017,US,"What an amazing record Robert Young has with its Chardonnay, which has been famous as a vineyard-designate by Chateau St. Jean since the 1970s. As ever, the '03 is rich and opulent, soft in acids and instantly addictive for the purity of fruit. Peaches and cream star, with a baked meringue complexity that's simply irresistible.",US
8018,US,"Part of the Jess Jackson empire of wineries, Hartford has a stellar record over the years across everything it produces, and this Chardonnay doesn't disappoint. It's bone dry and high in acidity, with a stony minerality that frames controlled peach, pear and mango fruit. The wine has that hard-to-define quality of elegant class.",US
8019,US,"What a string of successes Byron's Nielson Chard has had over the years. As always, this is a high acid, mineral-filled wine, with a taste of lighter fluid riding over the pineapple, pear and kiwi fruit. Very dry, it should be considered for the cellar, if you're into aging the handful of California Chards that can handle it.",US
8020,US,"Although the grape sourcing on Overlook has changed, the wine's price has barely nudged over the years, and it still shows the polish and zest of all Landmark's Chardonnays. It's a wonderfully rich wine, finely balanced and rewarding.",France
8021,US,"This Chard has a lot of lees and oak influences. It feels overworked, especially given the high acidity and lean, citrusy fruit. Bone dry, this single-vineyard wine should work well with raw shellfish.",US
8022,US,"85 Linden 2001 Hardscrabble Chardonnay (Virginia); $22. Not afraid of using oak, Linden's Hardscrabble, named after the site in the Blue Ridge Mountains, has toasty vanilla and popcorn aromas that translate to buttery oak in the mouth. It's backed by nice tropical fruit, but the wine's body doesn't quite size up.",US
8023,US,"A tightly structured wine marked by apple and peach flavors, but there's a young earthiness that keeps it from being a mere fruit-fest. Lush, creamy and complex, with real density and weight. Lots to like here.",US
8024,US,"A remarkably intense wine from vineyards located in the western hills of Salinas Valley. Made with grapes ripened enough to veer it into tropical fruit territory, but those telltale Monterey acids are bright as a bell. A solid dose of oak lends smoky vanilla and spice components. The result is a full-throttle wine, strong and flavorful. What it lacks in refinement it makes up in sheer exuberance.",US
8025,US,"Ripe and full-bodied with tiers of fruit flavors ranging from green apples and peaches to pears and mango. None-too-subtle oak adds vanilla, smoke and butterscotch elements. Just enough residual sugar for it to drink a bit like an orange-vanilla milk shake.",US
8026,US,"Rich and packed with spicy tropical fruit. New oak imparts smoke and vanilla notes. The texture is creamy and smooth, kind of custardy, with high acidity that makes it drink whistle-clean. A very nice wine.",US
8027,US,"A fine effort, brimming with bright, clean lemony fruit, as well as spiced apple, pear, and vanilla. It's light on the oak, and drinks very clean and supple, with impressive depth. Low alcohol (12.1%) keeps it light and enjoyable.",US
8028,US,"Made in a superripe style, this Chard is jammy in apricot preserves, peaches and cream and pineapple juice flavors, brightened with a nice cut of acidity. It's nice and dry with a brisk, spicy finish.",US
8029,US,"Ken Wright is one of more than a dozen winemakers sourcing fruit from this exceptional vineyard. These 30-year-old Chardonnay vines are some of the oldest in the Northwest. Here they display substantial lime and citrus flavors, whiffs of honeysuckle and clover, light peach and some buttery richness in the finish.",US
8030,US,"Chewy, minty and firm, with full-bodied flavors of apricot and peach. The fleshy fruit is enhanced with sur lies aging in 40% new French oak barrels.",US
8031,US,"Stainless steel fermented and aged, to bring bright, acid-driven fruit to the forefront. Full-bodied and flavorful, with nicely mixed stone fruits, pineapple, green berries and lemony citrus. It sets up sharply on the palate and holds true, just waiting for some fresh shellfish.",US
8032,US,"Monterey Chards often exhibit this aroma, which makes you think you could pick them out in a blind tasting. The wine smells fresh and juicy, with Key lime pie and tropical fruit notes. In the mouth, it's rich, fruit-forward and oaky. This Chard is designed to dazzle.",US
8033,US,"Another flavorful Chard from a fine region and vintage. Aromas of tropical fruits, spices, oak, smoke and lees. Rich and fine in the mouth. The structure is particularly elegant, with crisp acidity, smooth tannins and alcohol all well integrated with the fruit. Gets extra points for harmony and balance.",US
8034,US,"Classic Highlands Chard, with very bright, pure, focused aromas and flavors of tropical fruits and spices. The flavors are strong and clean. Oak adds shadings of smoke, vanilla and buttered toast, and there's something creamy and leesy in the texture. A fine wine of some complexity, at a fair price.",US
8035,US,"Starts with classic California Chardonnay aromas, including ripe peach and tangerine, smoke, honey, buttered toast and a nice burst of creamy lees. It's very fruity (as you'd expect from this vintage) and sharp, with good acidity cleansing the palate. A very pleasant wine and well worth the price.",US
8036,US,"Here's another good Chard from a vintage that produced a lot of them. It's ripe and aromatic, with a depth of peach-apple fruit, spices and smoky oak. A hint of lees and a creamy texture add complexity.",US
8037,US,"If the grapes were any riper, they'd be doing chin-ups in the glass. A blast of pungent peach, green apple and cantaloupe notes is accented by new oak. That power carries over to the flavors. It might almost be too ripe for food. Definitely in the California style, like it or not.",US
8038,US,"From cool coastal vineyards, this wine shows an unusual degree of richness for this price. The nose offers tropical fruits and spicy oak, and the flavors are boldly fruity. It almost achieves a degree of complexity. All in all, a fine value. Best Buy.",US
8039,US,"Super-ripe grapes put their shoulder to the wheel for a highly extracted wine characterized by masses of peach and pear flavors. Oak contributes added spice, vanilla and smoke. It's as plush as could be, but it's also soft and a bit flabby. An impression of sweetness lingers in the finish.",US
8040,US,"Never effusively fruity, Hendry Chards are characterized by polished herb and mineral notes, although there are underlying peach flavors. This ultradry wine is crisp and earthy, with a complex balance that makes you like it more and more as you sip.",US
8041,US,"Distinct for its powerfully intense lemondrop and lime pie flavors, this Chard also is rich and zesty in citrusy acids. Oak plays a supporting role, bringing toast and vanilla accents. Perfect with shellfish, especially cracked crab.",US
8042,US,"A rich, complex Chardonnay with apple and peach notes and a strong mineral component. A scent of something like gunmetal or flint follows through in the flavors and helps give the wine a steely backbone. A distinctive wine; very dry and crisp.",US
8043,US,"A likable, easy-drinking Chard that won't bust your budget, with plenty of ripe flavors and winemaker bells and whistles. It's got spicy, vanilla-accented peach aromas, and while it drinks a bit thin, it's got some class and style. The finish lasts for a pretty long time, with oaky, spicy flavors. This is a good value, especially from a top winery. Best Buy.",US
8044,US,"This Napa winery has been reaching into the Russian River for their Chardonnay, with good results. Dry and crisp in acids, the wine has a minerality behind the green apple, peach and melon flavors. The firm structure should provide for aging through 2009.",US
8045,US,"Crisp and clean; a bit leaner than you'd expect from South Coast grapes, veering into citrus fruits like grapefruit. New oak and lees aging adds complexity, but still, it's an angular, structural wine. Food will wake it up.",US
8046,US,"Ripe peaches, mango and citrus jump from the glass; there's no lack of lush fruit in this reserve. Oddly, despite barrel fermentation, the fruit completely overshadows any trace of oak. Juicy and ripe, with some slightly bitter citrus rind in the finish.",US
8047,US,"Anything remotely resembling true Chardonnay at this price is rare, but here's one that succeeds, if at the most elemental level. It's got proper apple and peach fruit and the requisite amount of vanilla-tinged oak, although probably not from new French barrels. It's a tiny bit sweet, but hey, that's the way people like it. And it's very clean. All of which makes it a great value in   Chardonnay.",US
8048,US,"Lees and oak dominate the nose of this very ripe wine. The result is size: A big, rich, oaky, fruity quaff, it fills the mouth with flavors and palate impressions. At the same time, it's a one-dimensional wine; it assaults the senses, but on one plane. Finishes semi-sweet.",US
8049,US,"This is a balanced, easy to drink Chardonnay, with citrus, peach and green apple flavors that have been finished with a veneer of smoky oak. It's totally dry. Do not overchill it, as it's a delicate wine that needs some warmth to open up.",US
8050,US,"Byron's regular Chardonnay has historically been a very good wine. This continues that tradition, rich in tropical fruits, but extremely dry, with a stony minerality and high acids that stimulate the taste buds and call for rich fare.",France
8051,US,"If you're looking for a kosher Chard, try this one. It's a fine wine, rich in fruit, well-oaked and balanced, with the creamy, full-bodied mouthfeel you want in this varietal. The peach custard, pineapple and kiwi flavors are simply delicious.",US
8052,US,"From a value leader, another rich, creamy, toasty Chard, loaded with peach, apple and pear flavors and a lot of oak. Good acidity and a long finish, but it has a little too much sugar to be considered dry.",US
8053,US,"This well-known, widely-distributed wine offers round apple-toast aromas and a rich, soft mouthfeel. Apple, caramel and orange-tea flavors play on the palate and into the creamy finish, with its big, spicy oak. It's solid and satisfying in a very mainstream manner.",US
8054,US,"From this very noble vintage comes a bottling that is softer than the Camelot bottling but no less rich and fruity. Filled with tremendous fruit flavors—apples and peaches specifically—and ultraspicy, cinnamon notes from both the grape and the oak. Made in the fashionable style, round and sweet, although it's a little flat and lacks added dimensions.",US
8055,US,"From one of the best Chardonnay regions in the state, a cool-climate wine with pronounced peach, apple and tropical fruit flavors and a blast of zesty, spicy, smoky oak. Clean and crisp, with a creamy, rich texture. Finishes with a vanilla note. The package is marred by too much sugar; consumers love sweetness, but this one takes things a little too far.",US
8056,US,"A nice Chardonnay if you like really strong fruit and spice. Mouth-watering flavors of tropical fruits and super-ripe peaches, and a creamy, tangerine note that follows all the way through to the rich, slightly sweet finish. May be too big for some, but that's the style.",US
8057,US,"Here's a compact, young Chard that's tight in minerals and acidity, riding high over well-oaked tropical fruit and peach flavors. It's closed now, and should be allowed to breathe for a while. Drink now through 2009.",US
8058,US,"A simple but likeable Chard, with pretty apple and peach flavors and lots of crushed hard spices, like cinnamon and nutmeg. Has a touch of smoky oak. The K-J style really hasn't changed much over the years: Pick the grapes ripe, keep things slightly sweet and get some wood notes in.",US
8059,US,"Looking for an inexpensive Chard with true varietal character and nutty, spicy, vanilla-tinged flavors from oak? Here's one. It's strictly no-frills, but it does offer a lot to like, and at a decent price.",US
8060,US,"A richly fruity, spicy, oaky wine that offers up plenty of what consumers like, in an everyday, affordable package. The fruit veers toward peaches and tropical fruit, and it's a little sweet. Seems flabby around the edges, but not bad for the price.",US
8061,US,"Starts with fruity, lush aromas of honey, apple, butter and cream, caramel, toast and smoky oak. Nicely layered flavors of ripe peaches and green apples and spices. A winemaker's wine that's just a tad sweet and soft, but very clean, with a swift, pleasant finish. Best Buy.",US
8062,US,"Ripe, oaky, but inexpensive Chardonnay often smells like lemon-lime soda pop, with a waft of spice and vanilla and a hint of smoke. This version tastes fruity and more than a little sweet, but it's not flat, thanks to vibrant acidity. It's geared to the American palate, at an affordable price.",US
8063,US,Shows the distinctly high acidity and laser-pure lemon and lime flavors that are so typical of this chilly appellation. You'll also find enriching oak and lees influences in this clean Burgundian-style wine.,US
8064,US,"Pleasant enough and Chard-like, with aromas of tangerine, peach and a kiss of honeyed oak. It's got enough residual sugar to almost fall into the off-dry category. Well made and certainly affordable.",US
8065,US,"Aromas of white peach and apple wood, with a dab of oak and butter. In the mouth it's very fruity and a bit sweet. The acidity is high and cutting. It's one-dimensional and finishes rough and earthy.",US
8066,US,"Soft and easy to drink, with pronounced fruity-spicy flavors and a solid dose of smoky oak. Quite sweet and soda-like, with a sugary finish.",US
8067,US,"Pleasant enough and Chard-like, with aromas of tangerine, peach and a kiss of honeyed oak. It's got enough residual sugar to almost fall into the off-dry category. Well made and certainly affordable.",US
8068,US,"Handley's Anderson Valley bottling is always bright in acids, which are so nice and clean in a Chardonnay as fruity and rich as this. The flavors are a complex melange of pineapples, peaches and pears.",US
8069,US,"Earthy and minerally, and very dry, this Chard has a scour of high acidity. It's a lean wine, by the usual fruity standards, but a clean, complex one, rather Chablisian in its way, and might improve with some time in the cellar.",US
8070,US,"Made in a very ripe, extracted style, this eccentric wine has flavors of apricots, or more precisely, apricot marmalade on buttered toast, because it's also oaky. It's dry and crisp in acids. A bit unusual, but in its own way, a good wine.",US
8071,US,"Made in a very dry and acidic style, this wine has flavors of limes, honeydew melons and buttercream. It's tight and minerally, with a tart, high-acid finish, and seems designed to complement food.",US
8072,US,"Has everything the best Chards have, without quite the same complexity or depth, of course. But's it's a value for the rich pear, peach and pineapple flavors, creamy smooth texture, and sumptuous overlay of oak.",US
8073,US,"Nutty aromas reminiscent of cashews lead the way, followed up on the palate by more roasted nuts, white peaches and nectarines. Picks up some elegant citrus notes on the long finish. Based on a recent tasting of the 1997 Estate Selection (rated 90), this should improve over the next six months to a year.",US
8074,US,"From up in the Chalone highlands comes this very dry, acidic and rather earthy Chard. It has peach and apricot flavors, with a touch of green tea and tannins. Seems like it has the structure to age, although that has got to be considered a gamble.",US
8075,US,"This simple Chard has likeable, intense flavors of lemons and limes and other tropical fruits, such as guavas and nectarines. It's very dry, and the finish is rich in clean, bright, palate-stimulating acids.",US
8076,US,"This wine is oaky; it's 100% barrel fermented and aged in new French oak for 12 months. Despite that, it's not over the top. Aromas of smoke and cured meats lead the way, then sweet pears. The texture is slick—even oily—and definitely viscous. Finishes long, with plenty of oak-imparted spice.",US
8077,US,"What a difference from Borghese's regular chardonnay.  This one is loaded with class and refinement, from the delicate aromas of light toast, pear and hazelnut through the nearly weightlesspalate that somehow carries a great deal of flavor.",US

8079,US,"This has a rich earthy quality, suggesting sweet heaps of mulch and herbs, in addition to fruitier flavors of apples and peaches. It's also somewhat soft and well-oaked. If you're looking for an example of Napa Chard, for better or  worse, this is a good one.",US
8080,US,"Parker's basic county Chardonnay shares the same features as his upper tier, namely a wonderful balance of acids, fruit, oak and alcohol. The flavors are of tropical fruits, although the wine is necessarily not as rich or concentrated as the single vineyards.",US
8081,US,"Smoky and meaty, with nut, white-peach and clove notes. Firm acidity allowed 100% barrel fermentation without the wine becoming overly soft.",US
8082,US,"Ripe and buttery, this reserve Chard from winemaker Eric Fry could hardly be more different from his White Label bottling. Superripe pineapple fruit is marked by plenty of oak-imparted spice. Lush and ready to drink.",US
8083,US,"Past Chardonnays from this vineyard have been more opulent, and it's a curiosity why the winemaker shied away from ripeness this vintage, when it should have been easy. The absence of richness makes the acidity and alcohol stand out. It's a good wine, just something of a disappointment.",France
8084,US,"This is the middle tier of Wölffer's Chardonnay offerings, squarely between the top-of-the-line Estate Selection and the entry-level La Ferme Martin label. The Reserve exhibits plenty of buttered-pear flavors, complemented by faint nutty aromas and some toasty oak notes that gain steam on the finish.",US
8085,US,"Toasty, perhaps a little overly toasty, with lots of menthol notes. Still, there's an attractive nuttiness to the wine and solid pear and white-peach fruit.",US

8401,France,"Soft and ripe, this has the richness of ripe apples and pears, but is lightened with bright acidity. There's a great tang of lemon to lift the wine into crispness while remaining richly textured.",France
8402,France,"From grand cru vines in Avize, Oger, Cramant and Oiry, this is full and intensely flavored, with very crisp apple and white pear flavors. To finish, the wine rounds out with vanilla and smooth textures.",US

8409,France,"The softness of the 1999 vintage is very apparent in this approachable wine. It is full, round, only just touched by minerality, white fruits and some almonds giving weight and character.",France
8410,France,"A good wine, this is a young, aromatic Chardonnay with lively white fruits bursting from the acidity.",France
8411,France,"Mainly from the lieu dit vineyard of Crotot, this is powerful, rounded in the way that Meursault should be. The fruit is ripe, filling the mouth with apples and cream flavors, topped by understated wood.",France
8412,France,"Muscular, powering its way with richness and structured tannins. The white pear and almond flavors seem to sit on top of this dense wine, which will need to age. It reflects the super-rich side of white Burgundy in 2005.",France

8417,France,"More toast than fruit even at this young stage, this is a ripe wine, showing big woody, toasty flavors that leave freshness behind. There are flavors of cream, caramel and wood here. Acidity appears on the finish.",France
8418,France,"Very open and ripe, touched with wood and centered around some creamy red apple and green pear flavors. The wood comes through strongly later, leaving a powerful vanilla aftertaste.",France
8419,France,"This is a blend from seven of Pascal Agrapart's less important vineyards. It tastes as young as many of the vines are crisp with some citrus and fennel, but there is some softness. Not for aging.",France
8420,France,"Soft butter and vanilla-almond milk mingle with pear and Gala apple aromas and flavors. Accents of thyme and orange blossom add complexity to the bouquet, while woody sweet spice appears in the mouth and sticks around through the long close. Full, creamy and decadent. Only 5,200 bottles produced.",France
8421,France,"A tight, very mineral wine, with crisp acidity, firm fruit flavors and just hinting at caramel and vanilla. This is  still young, hiding behind its structure. Give it 3–4 years.",France
8422,France,"Full-bodied and ripe, with cool green fruits topping some rich vanilla, cream and white currant flavors. It's certainly very fruity, but there's an extra dimension of a youthful structure that needs another year to develop fully.",France

8428,France,"Full, ripe and creamy, an unctuous Chardonnay from one of the largest private estates in France. The wine features melon, a line of citrus and pure, bright acidity. Screwcap.",France
8429,France,"Soft and creamy, structured with some green apple skin flavors, and easy, fresh acidity. It has good weight alongside tannins and ripe fruit.",France
8430,France,"Baked red apple, soft peach and a touch of whole vanilla bean fill the bouquet, while notes of clementine rind and soft wood develop in the mouth. Round but not fat with medium acid and a solid finish. Drink now.",France

8437,France,"Smoky wood makes its presence known. This wine has a soft, rounded texture and a warm, rich feel. There's attractive citrus and apricot fruit to go with the wood spice.",France
8438,France,"Deep yellow in color. This has a somewhat closed nose with hints of hay, yellow fruit and honey. The fairly low acidity magnifies the full body, round midpalate and creamy texture. A well-integrated note of buttered toast nods to the use of some new oak. This wine is for hearty poultry and polenta dishes.",France
8439,France,"The round mouthfeel is balanced by medium acidity and an orange-oil lift on the palate. Nuanced and refined, with delicate notes of apple skin and firm fresh-cut peach slices. A nice woody spice flavor remains on the finish. Drink now.",France
8440,France,"A touch of sweet spice jazzes up the nose, giving lift to the lightly baked apple and yellow peach characteristics. The round, medium-bodied palate has lively acidity and a sweet orange-oil flavored finish.",France
8441,France,"A slight vanilla accent glimmers through the fresh fruit aromas of pear and apple flesh. Round and ripe on the palate, the finish takes a seductive tropical-fruit turn before finally landing on a clean, clementine citrus note.",France
8442,France,"Nuanced toasty aromas augment the red apple and peach pit notes in the bouquet. Medium acidity picks up the palate, with an attractive nuttiness to the solid finish. Well balanced and very accessible now.",France
8443,France,"There's a nice yellow-flower character to the red-apple and nectarine aromas. The medium-weight mouth turns a bit sweeter than the nose suggests, with ripe tropical-fruit flavors that continues through to the finish. Drink now.",US
8444,France,"Dainty wisps of white flower scents come and go in the bouquet, fighting for recognition beyond the ripe pear and melon aromas and flavors. A pinch of sweet spice flavor unfolds on the close, mixing with a sweet orange-oil essence.",France
8445,France,"A ripe and lush style of Chardonnay that's widely available, this has assertive characteristics of pineapple, mango and sweet citrus that are plentiful throughout the nose and mouth. Medium weight, with a straightforward style and a brisk, clean finish.",France

8454,France,"While the aromas of this young wine reveal considerable toast, on the palate the wine brings forward the ripe apricot and mango flavors to go with that wood. As it matures, these elements will coalesce with the taut, tense mineral texture into an superb, ageworthy terroir-driven wine.",France
8455,France,"While the wine does have richness, it's the mineral and citrus side that is coming through at this stage. The balance with the wood aging is so right that you feel the toast rather than tasting it. As it matures, the wine will deepen in intensity and power, certainly over the next 5–10 years.",France
8456,France,"A deliciously fruity wine, its bright apricot, pineapple and peach flavors open and generous. Of course, there is a more serious core of structure, lemon zest and dryness to promise aging. At the end, though, fruit and a light toastiness give immediate pleasure.",US

8469,France,"This Valmur brings out great richness from the vineyard and the vintage while keeping an intense texture, orange zest and grapefruit flavors and a firm butter and toast aftertaste. Age for four years.",France
8470,France,"Opulent and rich, this is a concentrated wine with toast and fruit both showing strongly. The new wood flavors offer spice, while the fruit suggests pineapple, kiwi and fresh plums. Worth aging 2–3 years.",France
8471,France,"While it is rich, the wine is more dominated by the minerality and structure of Chablis. White fruits, melon and pear come through, with a citric edge and firm toast. It is taut and tense, ready to age.",France

However, it is the minerality that dominates, resulting in a taut, textured wine that needs five years aging.",France

8478,France,"This wine has the richness of 2009, while still is mineral, taut and textured. The yellow fruits are balanced by intense acidity and a ripe, full-bodied feel. The wine is complex, needing aging; the aftertaste intense, crisp and fruity.",France
8479,France,"Initially a very soft wine, it slowly shows its ripe fruits, intense texture and blend of buttery toast and acidity. Yellow fruits dominate, bursting through the acidity to give a ripe, opulent finish. Age for 3–4 years.",France

8488,France,"Along with all the ripe fruit in the wine, there is a kernel of serious structure. That gives the wine minerality, textured acidity lying over the depth of white fruits. Toast adds extra complexity before a crisp aftertaste.",France
8489,France,"A soft wine, favoring warm fruit, pear and peach flavors, the minerality coming later. The wine is crisp and fresh, with an intensity of acidity rare in 2009. That suggests it will age, although it is already fruity and refreshing.",France
8490,France,"The toast shows through strongly in this wine, giving a burnt edge. At the same time, the delicious fruit with its flavors of peach and green plum, is rich enough to develop well and produce a balanced wine.",France

8939,France,"One of the Vincent family's single-vineyard wines from Les Brûlés, a hot south-facing slope (hence the name, meaning “burnt”).

It is already giving great pleasure, but should last well over the next decade.",France
9026,France,"This steely, mineral, structured wine speaks of the chalk soil of Puligny. It is firm and crisp, even though the fruit is rich. The wine layers the white fruits and mandarin orange zest with some judicious toast from the wood, leaving spice and ripe acidity on the finish.",France
9027,France,"There is a definite richness to this wine, the ripe white fruit and melon flavors aided by a judicious amount of vanilla and toast.

9033,France,"This wine from a parcel in the Fourchaume vineyard is a step up from the Fourchaume premier cru wine.

9044,France,"Still young, this is a wine that needs to open and ripen. But already there are signs of richness, a wood- and tropical fruit-flavored wine that is typical of the full character of a Corton Charlemagne. It would be worth keeping 2–3 years for the wood to soften, the fruit to round out.",France

It is not a wine for aging, maybe 2–3 years, but is certainly delicious now.",France
9046,France,"Round, soft, with the fruit dominating its mineral character, this wine shows richness, but doesn't have huge aging ability. It is more a wine that charms, is open, lively, spice and dried apricots working together with ripe acidity.",France
9047,France,"A wine that is pure green and steel, only just hinting at wood. It has a very direct taste profile of taut green fruits, layers of acidity, just spiced up with toast and vanilla. It's obviously young, and should definitely be aged for 2–3 years.",France
9048,France,"Powerful wine that goes for the big, opulent style. Yet it has the serious intent and structure of a great wine, its minerality intense, the tropical fruits balanced with concentrated acidity. This is a wine that needs at least five years' aging.",US
9049,France,"Perfumed white flower aromas lead into a wine that is dense and ripe. As the palate opens up, white and yellow fruits, cinnamon and buttered toast all work their ways into a wine that is almost a meal in itself. Still young, of course, already fresh, it will surely deepen and broaden as it ages. Screwcap.",France
9050,France,"Fresh citrus and peach juice flavors are light, certainly not concentrated, but the wine has some pear skin spice and toast. It has crispness, poise and balance, with a delicious finale of bright acidity. Imported by Boisset America.",France
9051,France,"Very green aromas and a palate that is crisply green-fruited make a great contrast with the more intense Côte Bouguerots wine from the same grand cru. The palate has a very tight, taut character, on the end of an elastic band, with a green, crisp finish. Give this at least three years' aging.",France
9052,France,"An initially wood-laden wine that only slowly reveals the rich fruit character. There is wood certainly, but the spice integrates well with the green fruits and the intense minerality. The great steely backbone on this wine indicates it will age.",France
9053,France,"A very sensuous wine, showing its ripe fruit paces, its richness, just with a hint of wood, and its dense texture. The wine has spice, green plums, a citrus twist. It also has depth of flavor. Worth aging, but drinkable now.",France
9054,France,"This is rich, full-bodied Chardonnay, rounded out with peaches and spiced apricots. The wood is evident here, giving an extra softness as well as bringing out rich honey. A wine that opens beautifully in the mouth, ready to drink but also ageworthy.",France
9055,France,"A premier cru that could almost be grand cru in quality terms, this is a big, ripe wine, the powerful yellow and green plum flavors spiced with some wood aging. There's a great, full-bodied explosion of fruit in the mouth, but the mineral edge of the wine suggests aging potential, perhaps even more  ageable than the 2005 vintage.",France
9056,France,"A great cocktail of fruit flavors propel this wine out of the glass. It is ripe and crisp at the same time, the fruits running from peach to grapefruit and back again. There is plenty of acidity, crisp green apple structure, but at the end it is all about richness, a mouthful of delicious Chardonnay.",France
9057,France,"Made from 70-year-old vines planted by Christian Moreau's father, Guy, this wine shows extra concentration, certainly, but also the pure pleasure of ripe, delicious Chardonnay. It's initially tight, but the rich green fruits and toast soon come forward to give an impressively big wine, and one worth aging.",France
9058,France,"A superrich wine, full of apricot and Golden Delicious apples, with a touch of wood that rounds out the chalky, mineral texture. The wine is a delicious balance between ripe fruit and structure, ready to drink.",France

9061,France,"A wine that brings out all the minerality of Puligny. That makes it taut and structured but at the same time the fruit element plays a vital part. With citrus and apple skin, layered with fresh green plums, this is both complex and deliciously fruity. The vanilla flavors from wood aging round out the wine.",France
9062,France,"Ripe and soft, here is a Chanson white that hasn't been overwhelmed by wood. Instead, the delicious yellow and white stone fruits come through, with a creamy edge reminiscent of buttered English muffins, finishing on a high note of juicy, thirst-quenching acidity.",France
9063,France,"New wood and yellow fruit aromas give an exotic spice- and caramel-flavored wine. The acidity is rounded, sweet, delicious, lifted by intense new wood flavors. This is a rich Chardonnay, well tempered by final crispness.",France
9064,France,"This is one of the most popular Chablis premier crus, and this soft wine shows why. It hints at minerality, but the main flavors are a great burst of apple and citrus. It has just the right vivid green character, the vanilla from the wood a very subtle afterthought.",France
9065,France,"Very mineral wine, with considerable acidity, apple and grapefruit flavors. Flavors from wood give an extra character to this wine, which is ready to drink.",France
9066,France,The latest vintage of Labouré-Roi's oak-aged Bourgogne Blanc is showing some good rich apple and pear flavors with a creamy texture and just the right amount of toasty oak. Gentle acidity completes a fine ensemble.,France
9067,France,"Grand Ordinaire is the most basic of Burgundy's appellations, from outlying vineyards. Within that parameter, Bertrand Ambroise produces a light, fresh, citrus- and fresh pineapple-flavored wine, ready-to-drink with a touch of green apple skins to give structure. Screwcap. Imported by Robert Kacher Imports.",France
9068,France,"This wine is on the dry side of Brut. It is rich, at the same time crisp with a delicious creamed pear and apple flavor, lifted even further by pineapple acidity. Congratulations to Philipponnat for indicating disgorgement date and even the dosage on the back label.",France
9069,France,"A steely, mineral wine, concentrated and firm, with vibrant green fruits and very fresh acidity. The structure circles around green apple skins, with tangerine zest and some dry tannins. This is a wine that should be aged—give it 2–3 years. Screwcap.",France
9070,France,"A powerfully rich wine that brings in delicious white and yellow fruit flavors. It is unctuous, rounded, made richer with toast then given a boost by a streak of fresh citrus acidity. Good, plump white Burgundy.",France
9071,France,"The fruit here is attractive, pears and white currants on top of pink grapefruit and orange zest. It shows its structure and its tense minerality only slowly, allowing the acidity to give it a lift and vibrancy. This is a wine that is still young, still smoothing out its hard edges.",US
9072,France,"Soft butter and vanilla-almond milk mingle with pear and Gala apple aromas and flavors. Accents of thyme and orange blossom add complexity to the bouquet, while woody sweet spice appears in the mouth and sticks around through the long close. Full, creamy and decadent. Only 5,200 bottles produced.",France
9073,France,"Heavily wooded, this is a wine in which the toastiness is too much for the fruit. You can feel the weight, with hints of white fruits, but all that wood is just too much. Imported by Wilson Daniels Ltd.",France
9074,France,"Very light, flavored with fruit drops and pear juice, this feels soft, verging on dilute. Yes, there are some easy fruity flavors, but the acidity is missing and the wine is unstructured. Imported by Wilson Daniels Ltd.",France
9075,France,"Great steely, mineral wine, powered by startlingly fresh green fruits, vibrant, vivid acidity and delicious herb and plum flavors. This is lively, but also densely packed with flavor.",France
9076,France,"All 21 of the Puligny vineyards are in this village blend, including portions of premier cru. So it is right that it expresses all the minerality, distinction and structure of its magnificent terroir. But it is more than the sum of its parts, an elegant, steely, poised wine that finishes crisp and tight.",France
9077,France,"Big, ripe, generous, this wine is on the rich side of the 2006 vintage. At this stage, it offers peach and apricot, with honeyed yeast flavors. The minerality crispens the texture, while black pepper and firm tannins suggest aging ability.",France
9078,France,"A rounded, creamy style of wine but with a deliciously fresh green fruit and citrus character. It shows very pure, direct flavors, a line that goes right through the wine. There is only a hint of spice or toast at the mouthwateringly fresh finish.",France
9079,France,"This finely structured wine shows spice, almonds and delicious green plum fruits. There is some wood here, but the fruit is a great, dominating burst of ripeness. The finish lingers with fresh acidity. Worth aging for 2–3 years.",France
9080,France,"White fruits, figs, pears and currants dominate this fine, steely wine, a blend from a number of premier cru vineyards. The structure of freshly peeled apple skin tightens the wine, layering the acidity and freshness. The flavors crispen up on the vibrant, flinty finish.",France
9081,France,"Crisp, with green plum flavors, this shows plenty of immediate freshness, very open. The structure is soft, with creaminess and toast, the hints of minerality and austerity initially kept at arms length, then gradually pushing forward into the delicious finale.",France

9086,France,"White flower and pear aromas offer a wine that is mineral, nervy, vibrating with the freshest white fruits and lemon juice. It is concentrated, showing strong signs of toast, mature flavors, while keeping great richness.",France
9087,France,"Flavors of high toast wood are very dominant in this wine, and mingle with green herb, ripe pineapple and spice. The acidity cuts through it all, a band of freshness that comes with the structure of green plum skins. It could well age, and will certainly integrate more in the next two years.",France
9088,France,"A wine that brings out soft richness, with a creamy apple texture layered with green plum skin tannins. The wine has some tautness as well, giving a tight structure that opens up. There's a great mineral, steely streak, with freshness showing through on the finish.",France
9089,France,"The relatively unknown Côte de Léchet vineyard is on the southern bank of the Serein river, which gives it a cool exposure. The result in 2006 is a wine that is light, delicate, floating on fresh green fruits and honeyed toast. It needs food, with its crisp, fine finish.",France
9090,France,"A ripe, full wine, immediately accessible, speaking both of minerality and fresh acidity. The fruit goes right to the green apples, kiwi and juicy lemon flavors, but the structure is bold and rounds out these crisp fruits. A wine for aging, perhaps 2–3 years.",France
9091,France,"This exuberant wine has pineapple, pepper and perfumed toast. It is open, generous, kept in check with some crisp acidity, but essentially rich, lively and buttery. This is a down-to-earth wine, fat, prosperous and friendly.",US

9095,France,"Coming from the more northerly parts of Burgundy, this is cool Chardonnay, with steel and minerality. It is firmly textured, its apple and quince flavors coming with a more citrus element.",France
9096,France,"Big, ripe and surprisingly fat for 2006 Chablis, this wine goes for the yellow fruits as well as minerality. It offers full flavors, an up-front fruitiness tempered by a creamy backdrop. Age for 1–2 years.",France
9097,France,"Firm and tight, a wine that reveals more structure than fruit initially, leaving the citrus and grapefruit flavors to emerge later. Then it closes up again, keeping some of the mineral austerity. Keep this wine for a year.",France
9098,France,"A full-bodied wine that is rich and generous. It has spice from new wood, honey and buttered toast, as well as a delicious soft acidity that is mouthwatering. The fat texture introduces an apple and pear finish.",France
9099,France,"Textured wine, the crisp white fruits are tight against acidity and spice. It fills the mouth, broadening into a wine that becomes creamy, with wood and green plum skins giving structure. This is another example of how a lesser appellation can shine at the hands of a master vigneron.",France
9100,France,"Open and soft, with rich, attractive flavors of caramel, milk custard and peaches. There is ripeness in abundance, followed by great intensity of flavor. Subtle wood underlies the wine.",France

9102,France,"A smooth and creamy Champagne, delicious peach and apricot fruits linked by acidity into a harmonious whole. There is a great apple skin texture that gives a bite, just enough to shape the rich aftertaste.",France
9103,France,"Somehow this pure Chardonnay wine suffers from the Roederer preference for a higher dosage. With the Blanc de Blancs style, more minerality, something altogether more taut, would be better. That said, there is plenty to enjoy in this rich, full-bodied wine, with apricot as well as citrus flavors.",France
9104,France,"Part of the range of negociant wines under the worldwide Xavier Flouret range, this Chablis is earthy, rustic, a soft but underwhelming wine, missing the proper bite of the region's wines. Imported by Cognac One, LLC.",US
9105,France,"This wine goes deliciously towards the citrus flavors, spiked with minerality. However it does also offer some richness, flavors of pears and ripe red apples, softened with melon. It is balanced, vibrant, a full wine that also shows structure.",France
9106,France,"This is a delicious, soft, tropical fruit-flavored wine. The texture is ripe, full, the mango fruits melting in the mouth, just touched by spice. If it misses the more mineral character of Chablis, the pleasure is sufficient compensation. Screwcap.",France
9107,France,"Ripe tropical fruits, peach and pear flavors mingle well in this rich, toasty wine. To balance, there is citrus freshness, but the ripe flavors dominate. An immediately delicious wine that could be drunk now.",US

9109,France,"A ripe and rounded wine, with friendly apricot and lemon flavors, richly toasty, leaving great acidity and bright fruits at the end.",France
9110,France,"Dominated by wood, spice and almonds, this is a structured wine that moves in a straight line from its white fruits to ageworthy acidity and toast. It is still young, a wine that needs time to mellow, to move away from its tense fruit.",France
9111,France,"A complex name for this finely crafted wine. It shows green fruits and oak, some intensity of flavor and a great layer of acidity, cutting through the rich fruits. The finish brings all this acidity forward, giving a classic Chablis minerality.",US
9112,France,"The simple white Burgundy from the Vincent family of Château de Fuissé comes from the Mâcon region. It's a light, fresh and appleitinged clean wine with an attractive touch of toast.",US

9116,France,"Beautifully rich for such a lowly appellation in the Burgundy hierarchy. It is soft, open, dense, with ripeness and balancing acidity as well as flavors of pineapple and citrus pointing up the richness, just touched by wood.",France
9117,France,"Spice, especially nutmeg, is a distinctive character in this soft, ripe wine. It lacks some definition, but is attractively round. Fruit flavors tend toward white pears, edged with toast, while the texture is fat, full.",France
9118,France,"A ripe, crisp, yellow- and white-fruit-flavored wine. It shows taut minerality, the flintiness you find in Chablis. The structure is dominant in what is still a young wine, but the fruit is all there. Worth aging for a year.",France
9119,France,"Once called Crémant de Cramant, this has long been Mumm's signature Champagne. Creamy and soft, it is deliciously balanced, a wine that is both crisp and toasty, with mouthwatering acidity to go with its white currant and green apple flavors.",France
9120,France,"A big, fat, spicy wine flavored with white fruits and laced with crisp acidity. It is full and opulent, but not extravagantly so, the acidity cutting through richness, leaving yellow fruits and some toast.",France
9121,France,"Citrus and high toast aromas lead to a wine that is balanced, even if the toast element is slightly burnt. There are good fruit flavors, though, bringing sweet red apple juice and kiwi together with yellow plums. Give this wine a year.",France
9122,France,"A ripe, peachy wine that is rich and rounded, touched by toast from wood. Then there is a fresher element of citrus, pineapple juice and green plums. The two elements come together finely in balance, finishing with richness.",France
9123,France,"Very soft, this offers generous white fruits, with a rounded, open structure. It rolls around the mouth, opulent and full. This is very typical of Simmonet-Febvre's Vaillons, which goes for richness rather than structure.",France
9124,France,"At this stage of this smooth caramel- and vanilla-flavored wine, the wood element is prominent. Yet it has good weight, and you can sense the ripe, green fruits here. The structure is soft, round, just given crispness as the wine develops.",France
9125,France,"Puligny's steel shows well in this ripe, full wine that cannot hide the minerality of the appellation. Brought together, the white fruits and the core of tightness are surrounded by intense new wood flavors and vivid fresh acidity. The finish is ripe, creamy but remains crisp.",France
9126,France,"Full, ripe and creamy, an unctuous Chardonnay from one of the largest private estates in France. The wine features melon, a line of citrus and pure, bright acidity. Screwcap.",France
9127,France,"The wood is too much for the fruit with this wine. At this stage in its development, there is a bitter, high toast character that dominates the white fruits. Underneath all this toast, there are hints of fresh apples and cream flavors. Give it at least a year.",France
9128,France,"A finely structured wine that brings out soft acidity as well as pear and red apple flavors. There is a great layer of toast, some spice and a rich, yeasty character. The wine is elegant, delicate, well balanced.",France
9129,France,"Intense green plum, topped with pineapple sweetness and acidity, give this wine fine density of flavor. The fruit dominates, the wood a hint in the background, just offering some extra spice. There is a lively, juicy green and white fruit freshness to the finish.",France
9130,France,"Fresh and soft initially, this wine takes a while to reveal some mineral structure. But then, deliciously friendly white fruits surround this taut structure. The acidity is crisp, fresh, leaving orange zest and green fruits for the finish.",France

9132,France,"Attractive lemon flavors and some vanilla give this wine a good, lightweight pleasurability. The fruit is fresh, although the edge of candy shop sugar detracts.",France
9133,France,"A soft, rich and ripe wine, showing some light wood character and delicious forward pears and yellow plums, plus a crisp line of acidity that gives the wine a vivid lift and extra freshness. There is some minerality, but that is much less dominant than the fruit. Screwcap.",France
9134,France,"This big, forward, fruity wine loves its plum, ripe green and yellow fruits. Touches of buttered toast add to the rich mixture. Acidity is there, but this is a wine to luxuriate it, ready to drink now.",France
9135,France,"A creamy wine, with fresh acidity touched with spicy wood. It has the comfortable, plump feel of Meursault, but with some crispness. There are good citrus and white fruit flavors, even apricots, and then the acidity leaves a lifted, lively finish.",France
9136,France,"The impact of 50-year old vines is seen in the concentrated fruit, ripe and full,  in this wine. The flavors are of fresh apricots, edged with green apples and pink grapefruit, a combination that shows both richness and great freshness. The finish is a reminder of the fine acidity in 2006.",France
9137,France,"A smooth, ripe, creamy wine dominated by pears and white figs and given a twist of acidity with green plums. There is also a toasty element, well judged to just support the fruitiness of this fresh, but full wine.",France
9138,France,"A steely-styled wine, initially showing some bitterness, but with ripe citrus as a balance to the apples and pink grapefruit. This is a taut, poised wine, edging to green, with a strong tension and a final burst of toast.",France
9139,France,"All the fat fruit of Meursault was at its best in 2005, and even Chanson's use of high toast wood for aging the whites cannot hide it. Pineapple and peach flavors go with sweet yellow plums, juicy red apple acidity, and an exotic ginger and nutmeg spice that add complexity.",France
9140,France,"Pure, beautifully delicate wine, with mineral striations that line out the grapefruit and citrus flavors. It is certainly very crisp, with a light touch of toast just showing, finishing with a delicious burst of acidity.",France

9142,France,"Crisp, certainly, but with a good structure of red apple skins, with kiwi and white peach flavors. The wine is full in the mouth, needing several months to settle down and calm the acidity that is covering the honey and toast flavors.",France
9143,France,"Peaches, apricots and pineapple show well in this full-bodied wine. There is some good structure as well, coming from fresh, green apples. The wood is spicy, giving an exotic edge of nutmeg. Drink now.",France
9144,France,"A wine so soft it could almost have been sweetened, tasting of candies and fruit bonbons. There is just some acidity, giving it the possibility of being a pleasant apéritif wine. Screwcap.",France
9145,France,"White and tropical fruits dominate this powerful wine. It has earthiness, an edge of rusticity that comes from its youth. Persistent toast and spice give richness as well as some structure, followed by green plum juice and fresh, crisp white currants.",France
9146,France,"With its fresh, bright fruit, touched by minerality and flintiness, this is a delicious but relatively lightweight Chablis. The fruit is pure, clean, tightly crisp, with just a more exotic hint of pineapples.",France
9147,France,"A wine that is soft, rounded, ready to drink. It is without concentration or great acidity, but the white and light green fruits are delicious, giving an open character that is framed by toasty flavors and some spice.",France
9148,France,"Light wine, showing some citrus along with green fruit skin structure, this is balanced and crisp. The fruits take a while to open out, then give a rounded, soft palate, leaving a green apple and toast finish.",France
9149,France,"Great acidity, green fruits, delicious citrus touches: all the elements of fresh, crisp, lively Chablis are here, the core of minerality giving a great structure.",France
9150,France,"Soft as well as fresh, this is a rounded Chardonnay, with white peach flavors to go with crisp acidity and a balanced lemon aftertaste. Light and a great apéritif.",France
9151,France,"Fèvre's basic Chablis still shows the quality of this producer, with its finely textured, fully ripe fruit layered with a strong citrus character. There is some toastiness, which adds complexity but certainly doesn't dominate the green plum fruit flavors and lively acidity.",France
9152,France,"A light, crisp, fresh wine, with attractive lemon grass and orange zest flavors. It is juicy, the green fruits full of intensity. There is good minerality as well, underlined by toast from wood aging.",France
9153,France,"Starting with green acidity, this wine opens up well to give cool lemon and mineral flavors. These are followed by a creamy texture that softens the acidity, giving a ripe, full finish.",France
9154,France,"A citrus-dominated wine, lime and lemon giving a crisp intensity. There is a somewhat bitter toast element, but the acidity, the fresh fruits and the soft structure act as a counter-balance. Give it six months to a year. Screwcap.",France
9155,France,"An apple-fresh wine with attractive crisp acidity. The texture is of green apple skins followed by a firm, tight mouthfeel. The wine has a fine mineral edge, with a taut finish.",France
9156,France,"Rich and powerful, this is a spicy wine flavored with caramel and apricot. There is a layer of high toast that is out of balance with the fruit, and needs time to calm down. Wait 6–9 months.",France
9157,France,"With a sweet dosage, this is soft Blanc de Blancs. Pears, hints of apricots go with some crisp acidity. It still tastes young and needs time to integrate, but will always be on the sweet side of Brut.",France
9158,France,"An intensely perfumed wine that smells of a candy shop. It has tight acidity, but that is lost in the welter of white fruit flavors, allied with sweet wood. It seems at first too sweet, but then toast and acidity come in to give the wine an edgy finale.",France
9159,France,"The curse of Chanson's high toast for whites hits this wine. It is a shame, because once through the wood, the fruit is fresh and rounded, crispened but also given ripe white pear flavors.",France
9160,France,"A soft wine, but with a crisp, creamy, fresh character underneath the surface. There are pear and citrus flavors, with an adjustment of toast. The soft theme continues on the light and fresh finish.",France
9161,France,"A light, refreshing sparkler with just a hint of toastiness, Ehrhart's Cuvée Prestige features hints of lemon and lime and a fresh, citrusy finish.",France
9162,France,"Pear, red apple skins and lavender aromas start off this attractive Chard, while sweet lemon custard and fresh apple slices round out the palate. Medium weight, clean and balanced.",France
9163,France,"The vintage in Chablis seems to bring out both richness and minerality. That's certainly the combination here. The wine is full, with green plum juice followed by yellow peaches. At the core, though, is a tense, tight streak that comes from the chalk soil of the region, giving a firm structure.",France
9164,France,"Typically Meursault with its fat fruit and texture, this is a wine that doesn't yet quite integrate. The problem is the excessive wood, which dominates the fruit, and gives tense acidity to the wine. It leaves intense spiciness, burnt toast flavors and a bitter, grapefruit flavor on the finish. Maybe in a few years.",France
9165,France,"Rounded, soft and spicy, this is a lively wine; not complex, just enjoyable. Lemon and white pear flavors are dominant, while the acidity is easy, fresh and textured by green apples.",US
9166,France,"The wood flavors smooth out this ripe green plum and apple wine, giving toast and caramel alongside the fruit. It has some crispness, but the main texture is round and soft.",France

9171,France,"Although this wine is initially unfocused, the palate does show some pleasing rounded fruits and a touch of citrus and wood. Drink now.",France
9172,France,"The fabled Salon's latest release is much riper and softer than the great steely 1996 vintage. This suggests it is likely to be ready to drink soon. In the meantime, the acidity is supremely fresh, with grapefruit edges and green apple flavors. And then there is minerality and a tight, structured aftertaste as a reminder that this great Champagne is always going to be more than its fruit.",France
9173,France,"The purity of this wine is impressive. It has a straight line of mineral, flint and grapefruit running through it. Around this, there are layers of fresh apples, lime zest and a tight, taut structure. The one downside to what is a fine wine is that it, like many Roederer vintages, is too young. Give it 4–5 years.",France
9174,France,"Possibly the most famous Blanc de Blancs, this continues to be a yardstick. The style almost floats, a layer of bubbles that rests gently in the mouth, releasing great flavors of very crisp fruits and a texture that hovers between green apples and minerality. This is a classic.",France
9175,France,"A simple, fresh, citrusy wine with attractive floral aromas. There are flavors of kiwis and white peaches, which give an attractive lift.",France
9176,France,"Rich, toasty, mature, this important Champagne is all those things. It's certainly mature for a 1998 vintage, which means it would be delicious to drink now. But the ripeness, allied to the serious acidity and wood structure, do suggest that it's likely to age more.",France
9177,France,"Jacquesson is proud possessor of top quality grand cru vineyards in Avize. This vintage is subtle, a wine that takes a while to show all its richness, balanced with elegance. The fruit is ripe pear, peach and orange zest. It has a great streak of minerality. Worth aging.",France
9178,France,"A light, easy wine with some fresh green fruits. It is ready to drink. A soft, friendly wine.",US
9179,France,"A remarkable wine that manages effortlessly to bring together ripe apricot and sweet pear flavors with a balanced maturity that is so delicious. It has power and richness, but there is also minerality and a hint of a chalky texture. This 1999 needs less aging than previous vintages and can be drunk now.",France
9180,France,"A rich, rounded Champagne, ripe and fruity without being simplistic. The complexity comes from the toast, the vanilla and the spicy edge combining with the quince, pear and white peach flavors. The acidity is finely balanced. Expect to age this for 5–7 years.",France
9181,France,"Herb tea and white flower aromas give this wine a fine start. The Chardonnay flavors are all there: a touch of vanilla, some almonds, and pears. Fresh and  rich. Could age for a couple of years. Multiple U.S. importers.",France

9185,France,"Great green apples and white fruits dominate this intense, mineral wine. There is some power, but the wine also floats easily over its structure, enhanced by the appetizing aftertaste. This is for food.",France
9186,France,"A rich, creamy, toast- and caramel- flavored wine. There are impressive layers of complexity here from the apples and cream taste to the ripe acidity. Swathes of perfumed grapefruit and green fruits waft over this rich wine.",France

9189,France,"Pale salmon pink, this is a light, easy wine. Faint melon and herb aromas lead to an off-dry palate with sour-cherry and anise flavors. Nothing complicated here, but good enough balance to be refreshing.",France
9190,France,"A 100% Chardonnay that is rich, with a creamy feel and flavors of tropical fruits. It is full and food-friendly with a dry aftertaste, and a touch of almonds. Imported by Kobrand.",US
9191,France,"The Loire produces a crisp style of Chardonnay, and this one emphasizes fresh lime and other citrus flavors. It has structure, a crisp core of pear skins with a floral, green finish.",France
9192,France,"A nice perfume and crisp, well-defined stony and green apple flavors are attributes of this classified Chablis. Medium-weight, it has a good texture and structure. It finishes tight, with classic Chablis citrus and chalk notes. Appealing now, it should be even better in a year or two. Editors' Choice",France
9193,France,"Very toasty and closed, it was hard now to get beyond this wine's wood veneer. Faint honey and earth flavors accompany a rich mouthfeel, but this wears an almost impenetrable oak shell.",France
9194,France,"Nice tension shows in the floral, peach and stony aromas of this estate wine. It has a lean frame and taut spine, but good fruit, too, with the gentle peachy notes balancing the crisp edge. Closes clean, with citrus and spice. Viré-Clessé is a new appellation replacing the Macon-Villages, -Viré or -Clessé formerly mandated.",France
9195,France,"Offers a bouquet of pear and anise, plus an earthy floral note. Richer flavors of apple and quince follow, with lime and toast accents. Displays a good acid spine and some class, finishing even and dry. This wine has nice parts.",France
9196,France,"This sleek, elegant wine opens with a crisp bouquet of limes, nuts and toast. Subtle orange and stony mineral flavors sit atop a taut structure, making this archetypal Puligny. Firm acidity and a long, complex mineral finish make this young thoroughbred a champion. Editors' Choice.",France

It's very structured and tight now on the palate, with ripe earthy fruit, anise and hay notes still coming together.

9206,France,"Modern, tropical fruit aromas. Wood and sweet, ripe, pure fruit flavors with terrific concentration. This is an immediately attractive, forward wine, but there is also the structure behind to sustain it.",France
9207,France,"A seriously structured wine, revealing wood and honey flavors currently dominating ripe fruit. A powerful wine which needs time to develop",France
9208,France,"A full masculine nose of lime and hazelnut opens this solid offering. Restrained orange, peach and toasty oak flavors are displayed elegantly on the full, richly textured palate. Feels mature and ready to drink. Finishes with mineral, peach and oak notes.",France
9209,France,"Firm, structured wine which at present tastes young and rather unfocused. It is certainly rich and should develop well. The wood element is dominant at the end, but the fruit should come through to sustain it. The wine needs aging.",France
9210,France,"The well-defined bright lime and mineral aromas and light peach-pear flavors ride a fine acid backbone. Despite the crispness and mineral notes characteristic of this appellation, the mouthfeel is fairly full. Very approachable, with a clean, fresh finish. Tailor-made for shellfish and salads. Drink now–2003.",France
9211,France,"Crisp aromas with beautiful clean fruit. Rich, soft and smooth on the palate with honey and citrus elements well balanced. Delicious, ripe finish.",France
9212,France,"Spicy wood on the nose. Powerful, honeyed flavors. Richness and concentration, very soft but with a strong element of spice.",France
9213,France,"This introduction to white Burgundy derives from sources in Puligny and Meursault.

9214,France,"Tropical, honeyed fruit on the nose. Sweet, but rather dilute fruit. A pleasant, easy wine, with wood flavors. Soft aftertaste.",France

9217,France,"A glorious outpouring of beautifully crafted Chardonnay, opulent but tightly mineral. The ripe apple and pear character has a delicate, elegant squeeze of lime, while the whole wine is underpinned by wood. No doubt for long-term aging.",France
9218,France,"From arguably the finest white wine vineyard in Burgundy, this is a powerful wine that shows great weight, but balances that with intense, elegant structure, style and freshness. The flavors are endless and complex, richness combining with the lively character of the vintage. Age for many years.",France

9220,France,"From a parcel within the Chevalier-Montrachet vineyard, this is beautifully balanced, but a wine with considerable potential. It is rich, but thrust through with a sword of steel, giving acidity that offers a succulent counterpoint to the yellow fruits. The wood is becoming well integrated, offering further richness. For long-term aging.",France
9221,France,"From the largest of the Chablis Grand Cru, this wine shows a lively fruit character but also a powerful, taut mineral streak that comes through to dominate. There is no doubt this needs aging, with its steely edge and vivid acidity.",France
9222,France,"From a parcel that used to belong to the Hospices in Chablis until purchased by the Moreau family. It is a beautifully fashioned wine, its steely character rounded out with delicious ripe fruits, green apples, pear skin and kiwi fruit. Impressive and for aging.",France
9223,France,"Straddling richness and beautiful liveliness, this is going to be an impressive wine. It does need aging. At this stage, the wood is a big element, but then the bright white fruits—pears, white currants along with tangerines—will move center stage. Keep at least six years, almost certainly more.",France
9224,France,"The flagship wine from Bichot's Long-Depaquit estate is, as usual, impressive. It has richness, balance, full white fruits with just a hint of steeliness. Powered by a citrus acidity, it looks likely to age well over several years.",France
9225,France,"A ripe, bold and impressive wine, showing yellow peaches and pineapple flavors to go with its tight core of minerality. There is a touch of wood, but the main thrust is for broad fruit, open and welcoming.",France
9226,France,"A bright, steely wine with great concentration and a tight, mineral character. This is impressive Grand Cru Chablis for the long term, based for the moment on lime, almonds and green plums, but itching to broaden out.",France
9227,France,"Big and weighty, the wood very dominant, a wine with considerable potential. It feels important, seriously structured, edging on austere, but promising a much broader character after several years.",France
9228,France,"Tight and still young, a wine that brings out the intense acidity of the vintage, hiding its power and potential at the moment. But both are there, offering a concentrated wine that will develop slowly as befits its Grand Cru status.",US
9229,France,"Still tasting young, with its lemon and lime flavors dominant, this is going to be a serious, mineral-driven wine. It has plenty of fruit, but it is caged in a firm, tight texture of green fruits. Obviously it needs aging.",France
9230,France,"There is definite gravitas in this big wine. It has the proper power of a Corton-Charlemagne and is a rich and concentrated wine that shows big fruits, a fine cut of acidity and layered wood. A wine for the long term.",France
9231,France,"A firm, tight wine, still young, still not showing all the roundness and weight that is potentially there. This is a wine that needs decanting, offering some good aging potential.",US
9232,France,"At this stage, the wine is closed up, the fruit quite tight. But it is extremely rich, the potential from the spice, broad white fruits and intense minerality all promising good aging.",France
9233,France,"A big, burly Chablis, beautifully ripe, exhibiting powerful fruits overlaying a core of citrus and apple skin texture. The wine is open, rich, with an enticing juicy character, finished with bright, ripe acidity.",France
9234,France,"Still young, of course, but already the wine is showing great fruits, smoothed by wood, offering style and sophistication. As it opens up, the flavors of pears and sweet apples join the toast and the ripeness. This is on the path to greatness; give it 5–6 years and more.",France
9235,France,"Rich, full, powerful Chardonnay, with yellow fruits balanced with lemon, green apple and white currants. The structure, though, pushes the wine into a mineral direction, adding tightness and toast to the ebullient fruit. Age for 4–5 years and more.",France
9236,France,"A wine in two parts. It opens soft, with attractive green and white fruits. Then a tight, steely grip shows through, offering aging as well as a taut mineral character. Give the wine 4–5 years.",France
9237,France,"Still young, this powerful wine has intense steely minerality to go with its almost stark green fruits. It has a great texture, edged with acidity, and a light toast character. A wine for aging.",France
9238,France,"A finely balanced wine, with the acidity a pure streak through the white pear and lime flavors. The wine is rich, the wood so carefully judged with the beautiful fruit.",France
9239,France,"Plenty of ripe fruit and big texture on this intense wine, which hasn't shown half its potential yet. The pear and white peach fruits are edged with minerality and a closed-in texture. The wood gives an unfortunate burnt edge that needs to soften out. Age for at least five years.",France
9240,France,"There is a fine steely, mineral character to the wine that parallels the ripe yellow fruit, toast and quince jelly flavors. The ensemble is rich, but maintains the true cool-climate character of Chablis.",France
9241,France,"A beautifully balanced wine, its acidity blending easily with the fresh fruits, toast and rich texture. There is a high mineral content, but this fits well into the white fruits, lime zest and final freshness.",France
9242,France,"Big and bold, this lives up to the reputation of richer Meursault. Yet crispness, a core of tight structure, toast and fresh fruits are always present. The play between the characters is delicious and likely to allow the wine to age over several years.",France
9243,France,"Fine ripe fruit shows on this full-flavored wine, but there is as much of the vanilla, toast and spice character as there is of the peach note. The texture, though, is all fruit, tight apple skins with final fresh acidity.",France
9244,France,"A broad, fat wine, showing soft white fruits and a definite amount of toast. Only towards the end does juicy acidity show through. It feels not yet fully integrated, so hold off a year.",France
9245,France,"The style is full in the mouth, showing vanilla as well as soft peach fruits. Finishing richly, this is not a Grand Cru for aging, but it does wear its ripe fruit easily with a good burst of steely acidity.",France
9246,France,"The aromas are earthy, rich in moist soil. The palate is just as rich, a full, opulent wine powered with yellow fruits and a light touch of spice.",France
9247,France,"A wine that offers many personalities, from serious complexity to broad, smiling, ripe fruits. Pineapple, peaches, almonds and acidity come together in a texture that is still integrating. Give the wine another two years at least.",US
9248,France,"A warm, toasty wine, maybe with too much wood at the moment, but with proper plump, ripe peach flavors and an edge of apple-skin acidity. The wine needs aging —give it 4–5 years.",France
9249,France,"The wine has some of the steely, mineral character of Chablis, while also offering richer toast flavors. It is crisp, a delicious green edge to it, while the structure promises a few years development.",France
9250,France,"A bold, rich wine with yellow fruits, toast and spice. At the same time, there is a crisp, tight edge of acidity and minerality that gives a sense of the cool character of the chalk soil of Chablis. A fine wine, lively, ripe, but totally fresh.",France
9251,France,"A big-hearted wine, packed with forward fruits, maybe dominated by the wood at this stage, but likely to become more rich as it ages. The flavors are bold, white fruits combining with lime zest acidity. For aging over the next three years.",France
9252,France,"A ripe, open style of wine, giving white fruits, even some peach flavors, with toast and sweetness. There is weight, and a dense texture as well, the acidity lifting the finish.",France
9253,France,"Enticing aromas of pear juice announce a soft, open-textured wine, with ripe pineapple and kiwi along with a pear skin texture. The wine is ready, its fruit and integrated wood open, soft and welcoming.",France
9254,France,"A wine that starts with ripe citrus flavors, then moves easily into soft richness as the spicy wood and sweet peach flavors come through strongly. The wood is dominant, but not excessive. Full, ripe and still young.",France
9255,France,"A delicious wine that moves easily between rich, wood-aged Chardonnay and a tight mineral structure. It is ripe, with apricot flavors interspersing with pears and some orange zest. While it is ready to drink, another few months will bring out even more richness.",France
9256,France,"Good ripe and rich wine that shows some of the opulence of Meursault. It has a good balance between toast and broad yellow and white fruit flavors. With acidity an extra component, the wine is attractively complete.",France
9257,France,"Very pure lemon and toast flavors dominate this wine. It has crispness, intense freshness and lively acidity. There is also a sense of richness that is slowly developing and that will broaden the wine over the next several months.",France
9258,France,"With its touch of toast and full green and white fruits, this is a delicious wine edged with a mineral texture. It is ripe and looking to age for another 2–3 years.",France
9259,France,"With wood and white stone fruit in fine balance, this is a ripe, full wine, the acidity lighting up the ripe flavor. The wine has a broad character, ready for drinking in a year.",France
9260,France,"Perfectly round Chardonnay, not an edge or angle in sight. The wine is soft, juicy, broad, but never going over the top, keeping freshness and green fruits in play as a counterweight.",US
9261,France,"A broad wine, its ripe flavors fashioned with yellow fruits, toast, vanilla and an opulent texture. This is rich, open and packed with full-in-the-mouth flavors. Ready to drink.",France
9262,France,"A fine, fruity but structured wine. It brings together many attractive elements of crisp fruits, ripe peaches, toast and a definite tight structure for aging. Keep for 2–3 years.",France
9263,France,"A lively, fresh wine that gives a steely, mineral edge to the ripe fruits and the crisp acidity. The wine fills the mouth, a bold streak of apple skin structure boosting the fresh fruits.",France
9264,France,"An opulent style, very Meursault, the weight coming from the wood and the packed white fruit flavors. The wine is smooth, generous, a big ripe mouthful of fruit. The aftertaste shows some wood.",France
9265,France,"Smooth and rich, a wine that seems soft rather than focused. Hints of wood add to the attraction, while pear and lychee flavors give further ripeness. It probably needs several months, or a year, to come together.",France
9266,France,"This relishes the ripe softness of Saint-Aubin, giving a wide-open wine with weight. The contrast is with clean-lined green plums and just some spice.",France
9267,France,"Soft and rounded, with pear juice flavors dominant. This characteristic is balanced by a crisp, fresh, dancing style that gives delicious almond and herbal flavors. For drinking now.",France
9268,France,"A rounded wine, all comfortable fruits and texture. There is a nice bite of lime juice acidity to sharpen up the gentle character, as well as some toast to add spice. An attractive, already mature wine.",France
9269,France,"A mineral wine that brings an austere character as well as fresh fruit. Apples, pears and lime zest are all there. Attractive, open and ready to drink.",France
9270,France,"Going for a mineral character, the wine has freshness and also crisp lime, pineapple and caramel flavors. Light in feel, finely textured, almost steely.",France
9271,France,"While this is a light wine, on the steely side, it has a most attractive freshness and very crisp fruitiness. It is bright, shiny, just hinting at wood and more complex flavors.",France
9272,France,"There is a good deal of wood here, the wine tasting of toasty wood as much as the fresh white fruits. It is just on the edge of too much wood, but then the crisp acidity and rounded flavors bring the wine back into balance. It really needs aging, 3–4 years.",France
9273,France,"Light, fresh citrus aromas filled by beautiful spicy wood, with lovely crisp final character. The spice and wood add to the crisp juiciness of the wine.",France
9274,France,"This wine that offers both minerality and a fresh, creamy character. It is light, with citrus and bright pear flavors finishing as fresh and crisp as they come.",France
9275,France,"Ripe, soft and creamy, with yellow fruits, fresh acidity and a hint of toast. The wine is full, textured with pear skins, with a strong citrus element.",France

9277,France,"Broad, ripe, full in the mouth, packed with soft white fruits and an open structure. There is some wood, the vanilla melding easily into the fruit. For drinking now.",France
9278,France,"Full-bodied, relatively simple wine. It has fresh acidity, flavors of white stone fruits and almonds and an attractive citrus lilt. Ready for drinking.",France
9279,France,"A soft, open wine, giving wood and yellow fruit flavors followed by light acidity. The initial effect is somewhat dilute, but the wine does show more fruit character as it opens up.",France

9281,France,"A ripe wine, balanced with a crisp edge. The structure is rounded, full of green plums, quince, given liveliness with a lime zest acidity. There is a light wood touch that shows through at the end.",France
9282,France,"A wine that is all about crispness, structure and bright fruits. The creamy texture from lees aging gives a rounder dimension, but the main thrust here is minerality coupled with delicious acidity.",France
9283,France,"Caramel wood aromas, with smooth fruit. The wine is rich, warm, with the pure white and yellow fruit flavors showing well. It is crisp, but also rich.",France
9284,France,"There is plenty of wood here, quite a dominant feature. The fruit comes behind, showing bright ripe white fruits and a hint of apricot. The wood spice, though, has the last word.",France
9285,France,"A soft, smooth, apples-and-cream-flavored wine, shot with acidity and some green fruit. It's a light wine, very crisp and clean, better with food than as an apéritif.",France
9286,France,"Aromas of yellow flowers and cedar-plank-grilled pears follow through to the palate alongside notes of fresh peach slices and lime. Though quite round in the mouth, the finish is long and evolving, transitioning from ripe fruit to a clean, assertive acidity.",France
9287,France,"A soft wine that hints at the richness of Meursault, with caramel flavors giving weight, and a distinct citrus and apple character giving freshness. For early drinking.",France
9288,France,Here's an 100% unoaked Chard that offers ripe tropical notes of mango and pineapple alongside flavors of rich red apple and canteloupe in the round mouth. Softly prickling acidity leads nicely into the fruity finish.,France
9289,France,"An attractive, fresh Chablis, with flavors of juicy currants, spice and lime juice. It is crisp and shows full final fruit and acidity.",France
9290,France,"So light, dry and taut, you might mistake this for a Sauvignon Blanc with its grapefruit profile and high acidity. Still, the cleansing tartness is likeable, if not entirely expected. This will work as an apéritif or paired with lighter foods.",US
9291,France,"A very soft, ripe and open wine that lacks structure. The best aspects are the finely judged wood element and the light acidity that floats at the end.",France
9292,France,"Soft and open, a little unfocused but a pleasantly ripe Chardonnay. The white fruit and acidity are well in balance in a wine that is perfectly ready to drink.",France
9293,France,"Ripe, creamy wine with a good toast element. It is smooth, elegant, the flavors showing almonds, vanilla, baked apple and pear enlivened by fresh acidity. Attractive, ready to drink.",France
9294,France,"There is an edge of minerality, a tight texture. But that lies on a wine that has some weight and richness, white fruits giving a broad swathe of ripeness, just brought into line by the taut acidity.",France
9295,France,"This value-priced Chard offers a medium-intense bouquet of orange rind, Granny Smith apple and white peach pit followed by a round mouth with accents of apple skins and buttercup. Balanced with a solid finish and low alcohol.",France
9296,France,"Soft Chardonnay, nicely balanced between ripe white fruits and some toast. It is an open, generous wine, enjoyable and ready to drink.",France
9297,France,"You can definitely detect the wood on this wine, but it is finely integrated with the creamy apricot and white fruit flavors. Acidity fits well into this ripe, easy and soft Chardonnay.",France
9298,France,"A soft, firm wine with a nice touch of citrus. The character is fresh, light, with a fine burst of final acidity to mark an easy, bright wine.",US
9299,France,"Soft, rather unfocused wine, its fruit slow to show. There are flavors of apple juice, a tight steely edge, but the wine finishes simply.",France
9300,France,"A fresh, lightweight Chardonnay, hinting at citrus and almonds. There is a taut, tannic edge to the yellow fruits, the acidity turning to a firm texture. Final acidity is fresh and crisp.",France
9301,France,"Delicious soft, pure pear juice and quince flavors, touched by honey, still fresh and crisp, with lively acidity. An apéritif wine.",France
9302,France,"Here's a rich and smoky Chard with nice aromas and flavors of wood-grilled red apples with a caramel drizzle, peach pit and Key lime citrus. Solidly structured with good heft, a long finish and prominent acidity that keeps the wine from going over the edge and being too flabby. Drink now.",France
9303,France,"A very pretty, well-balanced Chard from South of France powerhouse Gérard Bertrand. Baked peaches, pretty yellow florals and a touch of honeysuckle integrate seamlessly in the creamy mouth. The finish shows notes of sweet citrus, leaving a clean and refreshing impression on the palate.",France
9304,France,"Starts off with a faint chemical odor that blows off quickly, allowing the more appealing notes of small white flowers, pear and toasted hazlenut to come through. Medium weight in the mouth with a solid, roasty finish. A great choice for barbecue or grilled chicken.",France
9305,France,"A moderate-weight, citrus-infused Chard with soft green apple and dandelion floral accents. A crisp, clean finish and medium acidity makes this an excellent choice for warm weather sipping.",France
9306,France,"Crisp, clean and clear Chardonnay, soft and attractive, the fruit on the citrus side, but with some red apple skin juice to make it richer.",France
9307,France,"The wine has aromas of pears. There is plenty of fruit here, but the freshness is missing, giving a southern, warm feel.",France
9308,France,"Simple, attractive, light Chardonnay. Green fruits and pear juice layer with acidity and a soft texture. With its lively, crisp finish, the wine is ready to drink.",France
9309,France,"Not overdone or overripe, here's a rich Chard that boasts fresh peach and red apple notes with notes of tropical fruit acidity. Clean and solid with a medium mouthfeel; an easy-drinking choice that's perfect for company.",France
9310,France,"Shows remarkable minerality and restraint for a 2003, with a nuanced nose of crushed stone and smoke, then delivers rich, enveloping flavors of honey, minerals and tree fruits. Tremendous length on the mouthcoating finish is its final indication of quality. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",France
9311,France,"Tasted twice, two months apart. This wine was fabulous on both occasions, combining the fat, fleshy ripeness and honeyed fruit of the vintage with the minerality of its grand cru site. Smoke, citrus and toasted nuts round out the flavors, which finish long and complex. Delicious now, but should hold several years at least. Imported by Vintus LLC.",France
9312,France,"An attractive Mâcon, with some rich character, forward white fruits and a delicious apéritif style of freshness and acidity.",France
9313,France,"Richly honeyed on the nose, with layers of mineral that lure you in. Tastes like honey-drizzled wet riverstones with a squeeze of citrus—mouthfilling yet precise. Long and intense on the finish. Imported by Monsieur Henri Wine Co.",France
9314,France,"Rich and ripe, with buttery, toasty aromas that are also reminiscent of bacon fat. Full-bodied, with ample apple and citrus fruit flavors that come to a climax in the long, hazelnut-tinged finish. Lovely, but with its rather low acidity, it looks to be a Burgundy to drink rather than to cellar. Imported by Vintus LLC.",France
9315,France,"Chitry lies just outside the Chablis appellation area, giving a wine that has some of the classic steely character but is more rounded and less focused. Pleasing Chardonnay, finishes with an attractive vanilla touch.",France
9316,France,"Pleasant, soft wine, easy to drink, its fruits round and somewhat dilute. It doesn't resonate, but is certainly fresh and crisp.",France
9317,France,"A decent Chard at an attractive price. Light intensity on the nose with suggestions of citrus and pear slices. The mouth is just as subtle, leading through to the short but clean finish.",France
9318,France,"Soft and broad, a little unfocused, the fruit showing pear juice and green apple skins. It feels light, juicy, missing concentration, and there's a caramel toast aftertaste.",US
9319,France,"Lightweight wine that seems somewhat dilute with flavors of green plums, bright acidity and a very soft texture.",France
9320,France,"With prominent biscuit notes, this crémant announces its allegiance to the elegant Champagne style. It follows through with a fine mousse and a light impression in the mouth. A few pear and earth aroams peek through on the fleeting finish. Drink up.",France
9321,France,"An interesting Chard that offers quite sweet notes of stewed peaches, orange marmalade and overripe honeydew. Big and a bit clumsy in the mouth, more vibrancy and freshness is needed to keep things in better balance. However, if you like 'em sweeter, this one's for you.",France
9322,France,"A simple but easy-to-drink Chardonnay with soft aromas and flavors of ripe red apple and pear. Medium weight with a solid, clean finish.",France
9323,France,"Open, soft, creamy, along with a candied fruit character. There is freshness here, with the acidity dominant on the finish.",France
9324,France,"Starts off with some forceful charred aromas and some rustic, unintegrated notes on the finish, but give this wine some time to settle down and it shines. Grilled peaches and roasted cashews mingle easily with mineral notes, and what the finish lacks in finesse at this stage it makes up in power. Better in 2008. Imported by Vintus LLC.",France
9325,France,"The dominant pear and melon notes actually come across as a bit austere despite the wine not being hugely mineral upfront. Where this wine shows its pedigree is on the long finish, which picks up anise and flint notes and a rich, plush texture. Imported by Monsieur Henri Wine Co.",France
9326,France,"Thirteen years on, this is still not remotely mature. It is a major wine, with its still-tight, vibrant acidity and wonderful piercing grapefruit flavors. The acidity of the vintage is all there, but the strength of this Champagne is that the acidity is finely balanced with minerality and fruit.",France
9327,France,"Bone dry, but soft, this is a complete, rounded Champagne. It has plenty of the Chardonnay mineral character, with fine citrus zest and tight acidity. It is nowhere near mature, so keep for another two years. Impressive.",France

9335,France,"A good value in Chablis, this bottling from the Boisset group offers steely scents of lime and minerals to go with austere, grapefruity flavors. It's a bit plump on the midpalate, yet finishes with enough cut to merit a recommendation. Imported by Boisset America.",France
9336,France,"A slight disappointment, but still very good, with honey, smoke, caramel and peaches. It's a bit over-the-top from a house known for restraint, but the superripe fruit is backed by some dry minerality. Bold and weighty, but not that long. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",France

9339,France,"A piercingly steely wine, all angles and acidity. That said, there's a greater depth of flavor that needs time to come out—the richness of the green fruit is there, as is the hint of wood. The corners need to soften for a year or so.",France

10051,France,"This is a terrific Chardonnay from Limoux, an area more typically known for its Blanquette (which uses the Mauzac grape) but certainly not limited to it.

Round and fantastically balanced, with a long finish kissed by toasted oak.",US
10052,France,"This Chardonnay shows a beautiful minerality supported by rich and pronounced flavors of cantaloupe, wood-grilled peaches and smokey roasted almonds. It's medium weight and lush in the mouth, with a long evolving finish. Drink while it's still got some chill to it, as the alcohol is a bit too pronounced after warming too much.",France

10069,France,"A light, floating style, pierced with minerality and crisp green apple skin flavors. There is wood, but it is only just noticeable. With its structure and tense fruit, this is likely to age well: give it 5–8 years.",France
10070,France,"Deliciously fresh, this is almost delicate, certainly elegant. There is great balance here, the wood just lightly toasty over the smooth, creamy white fruit flavors. For a wine from a lesser Burgundy appellation, this is impressive.",France
10071,France,"This is a wine that is about tropical fruits, softness and ripeness. It is definitely full-bodied, needing to show its structure, but the spice, toast and yellow fruit flavors are all immediately attractive.",France

10084,France,"Ripe and soft, perfumed and floral, this is pure fruit, a pear- and peach-flavored wine with a hint of toast and almonds.

10085,France,"This is a thouroughbred, elegant sparkler. With its delicate acidity, apple and grapefruit flavors, and tense, steely texture, it is an extremely well-blanced wine. Although it is ready to drink now, it could certainly age in bottle for many years.",France
10086,France,"The Spécial Club is a grouping of Champagne producers who taste each other's wines before allowing them to be released under this label.

10091,France,"This is Pehu-Simonet's contrast with its Blanc de Noirs from the Montagne de Reims. It has the same dryness as that wine, but it features a more open character. There is, of course, minerality imparted from the chalk soil, which is balanced deliciously with an intense citrus flavor. Age for another year in bottle.",France

10099,France,"In perfect balance now, this is a great expression of mineral-driven Chardonnay. Its acidity is a vehicle for the crisp flavors of pear and lime, with a hint of ginger. It's still young, so drink it now for its great fruit, or age for four more years.",France
10100,France,"A wine that is easygoing, with soft fruits and flavors of pears. But there is no intensity to this pleasantly fresh wine, only hints of wood and mineral. The aftertaste has light acidity.",France
10101,France,"The little touch of wood aging (three months) is just enough to round out the Chardonnay. At the same time, it does show freshness and apple flavors, with an attractive floral character. It is soft and finally ripe.",France
10102,France,"From the heartland of Chardonnay in Champagne comes this rich, creamy, apple-flavored wine. It has lively acidity, balanced with some sweetness from the dosage. It has weight and a crisp aftertaste.",France
10103,France,"Aÿ is better known for its Pinot Noir, so it's rare to find a blanc de blancs. Made in a rich style, it's full of grapefruit, citrus and apricot flavors. It balances this with taut, crisp acidity to produce a full wine that retains the dancing quality of a blanc de blancs.",France

10112,France,"Ripe Chardonnay, barrel fermentation and aging, stirring of the lees—all these elements make for a powerfully rich wine, in which the wood acts as a carefully judged supporting act to the intense apples and cream fruitiness. There is just a touch of Burgundian minerality to give some structure.",France

10117,France,"The fruit here is soft and rounded, with pleasant green and white fruits. It has some richness, but the acidity is unbalanced, giving too much green. The cool year may be to blame.",France

10120,France,"This tangy, zesty wine has a taut and tense character, balanced with acidity, fruitiness and firm texture. It needs 3–4 years of bottle aging.",France
10121,France,"Intense and concentrated, this epitomizes the richness of 2005. The wine starts soft, with more spice than fruit, then flavors of peach and quince come through, followed by an almost tropical element. The intensity stays right through the finish of this impressive, powerful wine.",France
10122,France,"This ripe, almond- and pear-flavored wine has a fine balancing structure of green fruit skins. It's certainly rich, but it also has elegance, restraining its exuberance through the finishing acidity, which promises 5–7 years' aging.",France
10123,France,"While there is crisp, green fruit here, this wine is much more about its richness, softness, roundness. There is some minerality, and the flavors of pear and citrus come through strongly on the finish.",France
10124,France,"This fruity selection is full of apple, citrus and white peach notes. Its fruit is balanced by a crisp texture and a tang of orange zest. The wine is round and warm, fitting for a Chardonnay from southern Champagne.",France

10135,France,"Winemaker Pierre Jehan's interpretation of Corton-Charlemagne for Henri de Villamont is to retain great fruit, but not to produce a wine with too much weight. The advantage is rich wine, with spicy pear and ripe yellow fruits, but with a great bounce of acidity.",France

10149,France,"There is enticing new wood here, a wine that shows richness to boost the ripe, creamy apple and pear fruits. It has a generous character, to contrast with its core of steely acidity. The finish is more earthy, suggesting the wine still needs time in the bottle.",France

10153,France,"A soft, rounded wine, with spice and toast and a cushion of plump yellow fruit. Almonds and mandarin oranges fit well together with the fine acidity.",France
10154,France,"This is on the weighty side of Chablis, giving a wine that is more Burgundy proper in its richness. That said, there is a good citric element, but the ripeness is more important, underlined by toast.",France
10155,France,"A wide-open, creamy wine, with flavors of ripe apples. It is round, generous, full-bodied, only just touched by minerality and edged with wood. Drink over the next 2–3 years.",France
10156,France,"The wine is well made, with some attractive spicy wood. But the fruit is less exciting. A soft, smooth but anonymous style.",France
10157,France,"Soft butter and vanilla-almond milk mingle with pear and Gala apple aromas and flavors.

Only 5,200 bottles produced.",France
10158,France,"This blanc de blancs certainly shows its dryness, but with the wonderful maturity that it is just beginning to develop, it also has plenty of richness. Almonds are emerging to balance the white, almost tropical, fruits, calming the extreme crispness of the acidity. A great wine, which should develop beautifully over the next 10–15 years.",France
10159,France,"This 12-year old shows signs of maturity, but retains freshness and liveliness as well. With its yeasty edge, toasty flavors and wonderful white fruits all in balance, it is finely balanced. The acidity is kept in check by the richness of the mature fruit. A very complete Champagne.",France
10160,France,"From a relatively open vintage, this is a wine that is generous, rounded, full of green fruits, and balanced with a ripe texture. It has weight, but has more to do with sheer pleasure. It could age, maybe over 5 years, but its nutty hints show it is ready to drink.",France
10161,France,"A blend of Grand Cru wines from Cramant and Chouilly and Premier Cru from Cuis (which is why it is only premier cru), this is all about freshness. It's more of a soft year, so this has a lightness and crispness while giving an open character over the creamy fruit.",France
10162,France,"Yes, at 12 years this is now mature, but it still has plenty of life. Ripely in balance, this is an impressive, nutty tasting wine that has acidity that acts as a foundation for the ripe structure. It shows how well pure Chardonnay in Champagne can age—and it has more years to come.",France
10163,France,"This vintage blanc de blancs is very much in the relatively rich, but also elegant Deutz style. The almost tropical white fruits are balanced with vibrant, fresh acidity, and topped with a soft aftertaste that lingers with almonds and toast.",France

10169,France,"For those who like their Champagnes extra dry, this is a good example because it has some richness to balance that intense grapefruit shock on the palate. It is beginning to get some good age as well, as the structure and the toast begin to kick in. Another year, and it will be delicious.",France
10170,France,"Pure apple and cream aromas, spiked with pear skin spice. As the palate opens out, it reveals tight fruit skin tannins, green plums and Granny Smith apples, finishing creamy but very fresh.",France
10171,France,"The blanc de blancs from Henriot has some fine, toasty, aged character. This is a rich, but still vibrantly fruity wine that shows some baked apple and pink grapefruit but also some maturity. A finely made wine, illustrating the benefits of some bottle age.",France
10172,France,"Cuis is among the first villages on the Côte des Blancs after leaving Epernay.

10175,France,"A warm, earthy, rustic style, richly fruity with peaches and sweet juiced fruits. There is good balance of wood, toast, nutmeg and sweet spice. The finale draws a fine line in elegance.",France
10176,France,"Erick de Sousa chose the name Caudalies, because it is a measure of how long the taste of a wine stays in the mouth, measured in seconds. This wine certainly lasts for many caudalies in the mouth. Packed with deep ripe-fruit flavors, powerful but also elegant, this is so rich, it almost has a tropical character.",France
10177,France,"Mainly from grand cru vineyards in Cramant, this is a ripe, smooth, creamy wine whose minerality is subordinated to rich white fruits and a pure, dense structure. Despite its relative youth, the richness means this wine is ready to drink now.",France

10179,France,"A finely structured, delicate, elegant wine, this has a pure white fruit and mineral character that lies easily on the palate. The aftertaste is soft but there is still a steely edge to the wine, which promises long aging. Give it at least 5 years.",France
10180,France,"A toasty, smoky wine, with freshening acidity, crisp green and white fruits and an attractive edge of toasty oak. The wine is lively, fresh, delicious, very poised and vibrant.",US
10181,France,"A young wine, with crisp apple and grapefruit salad freshness. It is bright, glowing with vibrant fruit and a light touch of toast.",France
10182,France,"This has certainly benefited from some bottle age, bringing out the nutty, lightly toasty character of older Chardonnay, while still preserving great white fruit flavors.",US
10183,France,"A ripe, rounded wine, with just some wood. It is soft, with flavors of apricots followed by a fresh acidity and a final waft of tropical fruits and spice.",France
10184,France,"Full, ripe and creamy, an unctuous Chardonnay from one of the largest private estates in France. The wine features melon, a line of citrus and pure, bright acidity. Screwcap.",France
10185,France,"Lacking intensity, the nose exhibits mild notes of ripe red apple while the palate adds a touch of canteloupe. Fat and round with a fleeting finish, the wine never really makes a strong impression.",US
10186,France,"A soft, smooth, apples-and-cream-flavored wine, shot with acidity and some green fruit. It's a light wine, very crisp and clean, better with food than as an apéritif.",France
10187,France,"Perhaps the most classically styled of these Chablis from Moreau is the Vaucopin, which features zesty lemon and lime aromas allied to crisp pear and green apple flavors. Finishes tangy, with hints of anise and toast. Try with oysters or soft chèvres.",US
10188,France,"Lots of oak on the nose, and for that matter, throughout. The wine tastes of lemon, vanilla and wood resin, while the creamy finish deals even more oak. Texture and richness are not a problem, but the wood runs roughshod over the mild, base-level fruit.",France
10189,France,"A nice perfume and crisp, well-defined stony and green apple flavors are attributes of this classified Chablis. Medium-weight, it has a good texture and structure. It finishes tight, with classic Chablis citrus and chalk notes. Appealing now, it should be even better in a year or two. Editors' Choice",France
10190,France,"Very toasty and closed, it was hard now to get beyond this wine's wood veneer. Faint honey and earth flavors accompany a rich mouthfeel, but this wears an almost impenetrable oak shell.",France
10191,France,"Shows remarkable minerality and restraint for a 2003, with a nuanced nose of crushed stone and smoke, then delivers rich, enveloping flavors of honey, minerals and tree fruits. Tremendous length on the mouthcoating finish is its final indication of quality. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",France
10192,France,"Tasted twice, two months apart. This wine was fabulous on both occasions, combining the fat, fleshy ripeness and honeyed fruit of the vintage with the minerality of its grand cru site. Smoke, citrus and toasted nuts round out the flavors, which finish long and complex. Delicious now, but should hold several years at least. Imported by Vintus LLC.",France
10193,France,"Sweet, light and floral, but not fruity. Lemon and orange flavors yield to a zesty finish. Simple and very high in acidity.",France
10194,France,Melon and peach aromas start out fine but lose clarity. Citrus flavors that aren't quite full precede mild lemon and banana on the tail end. Nondescript and turns hot at the end. Kosher.,US
10195,France,"Richly honeyed on the nose, with layers of mineral that lure you in. Tastes like honey-drizzled wet riverstones with a squeeze of citrus—mouthfilling yet precise. Long and intense on the finish. Imported by Monsieur Henri Wine Co.",France
10196,France,"Rich and ripe, with buttery, toasty aromas that are also reminiscent of bacon fat. Full-bodied, with ample apple and citrus fruit flavors that come to a climax in the long, hazelnut-tinged finish. Lovely, but with its rather low acidity, it looks to be a Burgundy to drink rather than to cellar. Imported by Vintus LLC.",France
10197,France,"Nice tension shows in the floral, peach and stony aromas of this estate wine. It has a lean frame and taut spine, but good fruit, too, with the gentle peachy notes balancing the crisp edge. Closes clean, with citrus and spice. Viré-Clessé is a new appellation replacing the Macon-Villages, -Viré or -Clessé formerly mandated.",France
10198,France,"Offers a bouquet of pear and anise, plus an earthy floral note. Richer flavors of apple and quince follow, with lime and toast accents. Displays a good acid spine and some class, finishing even and dry. This wine has nice parts.",France
10199,France,"This comes from high up in the Chevalier-Montrachet vineyard, from vines surrounding a small workers shed, the “cabotte.” It is the better of the two bottlings from this vineyard by Bouchard, although “better” here is like differentiating between two stars on top form. It has great poise, so although the richness is there, it is shot through with acidity and citric flavors that underline the huge, ripe fruit. Age for 10 years for best results.",France
10200,France,"As Anne-Claude Leflaive describes it, this wine is all about the complexity of the vineyard's soil. There is minerality and finesse from the chalk, which gives a structure. And at the same time the ripe fruit seems opulent, with vanilla and spice flavors adding something exotic. Age this wine for at least 5 years.",France
10201,France,"A fine wine that offers power, generosity and also a chalky, mineral character. No wonder Montrachet is seen as the greatest grand cru—it has structure, concentration, delicious fruit and layers of complexity. It also needs to age. To drink this wine now would be more than a shame.",France
10202,France,"This is a beautifully shaped wine that rises from a quiet opening. Muted and slightly closed up at this stage, it opens opulently but with balanced acidity and crispness, as well as richness and restrained power.",France
10203,France,"A wine of promise, but still in its infancy. This grand cru, structured and still waiting to open to its full opulence, is packed with concentrated flavors. It's a powerhouse that needs at least five years to even begin to show its structure, ripe fruit and richness.",France
10204,France,"This wine is deceptive. At first smell and taste, it doesn't show much—its spice and green-fruit aromas are not at all obvious. It's when you roll it around your mouth, that all the layers of flavor emerge. It is powerful, rounded, but with a fine line of minerality that holds the whole wine on a knife edge. The wood is beautifully judged, the fruit just beginning to develop secondary aromas. Hold for several years.",France
10205,France,"The richness of this wine envelops you from the start. It is all about opulence, but it's balanced with layers of ripe fruit and wood. At this stage in its long life, this wine from a fine white wine vintage is still dominated by fruit. The secondary flavors will start to show in 3–4 years time. A powerful wine that does not lose sight of a potential partnership with food.",France
10206,France,"This sleek, elegant wine opens with a crisp bouquet of limes, nuts and toast. Subtle orange and stony mineral flavors sit atop a taut structure, making this archetypal Puligny. Firm acidity and a long, complex mineral finish make this young thoroughbred a champion. Editors' Choice.",France
10207,France,"Long-Depaquit has a monopoly on this six acre plot which lies across parts of the Grand Cru vineyards of VaudŽsir and Les Preuses. This is a powerfully wooded wine, with ripe, sweet, honeyed fruit. Rich and concentrated. Beautifully structured.",France
10208,France,"Smooth and supple, this gem has a fully integrated nose that mixes toast, roasted hazelnuts and sweet meringue. The flavors are balanced and concentrated in the back palate and continue to expand beautifully right on through a fine, seamless finish. Elegant and graceful, this is picture perfect for near-term drinking.",France
10209,France,"Powerfully ripe wine, with honey and spicy wood aromas. Acidity combines with a smooth, creamy, toast character. Underneath the attractive fruit, there are also tannins and structure. Everything is in perfect harmony and balance.",France
10210,France,"Toasty, poised wine with delicious, ripe and elegant fruit. There is structure which shows right through the wine, forming the base for flavors of vanilla and citrus fruits.",France
10211,France,"Beautifully structured, ripe, concentrated wine with fine wood and pure acidity. There's a great sense of structure, giving firmness and a hint of tannins to the wine. Delicious, clean aftertaste.",France
10212,France,"The elegant, forward nose of this estate bottling boasts Asian spice, pear and acacia-blossom aromas. It's very structured and tight now on the palate, with ripe earthy fruit, anise and hay notes still coming together. Really kicks into gear on the long, expansive finish, which is at once juicy and minerally. Impressive now and better in two years. Drink 2003–2008.",France
10213,France,"It's not so much the fruit but the richness and concentration that mark this wine. Yet it's not superripe because of the hot 2003 vintage. This wine, with its origins in biodynamically grown grapes, preserves a great purity of fruit as it layers intense almond and citrus flavors over vanilla and yellow fruit tastes. It should age well.",France
10214,France,"Mineral and structured, this is a wine that is very linear and almost austere. There is elegance, fruit and wood along with a hint of ripe plums and peaches. But always that minerality, that steely character, which promise long aging.",France
10215,France,"This is the one grand cru that is entirely in Chassagne-Montrachet. It's a tiny patch of land (4.13 acres) making wines that are more delicate than the others. With its fine, fresh flavors so light to the taste, this is a wine that floats on the palate with a smooth, silky texture. Wood and white peaches contribute but do not dominate.",France
10216,France,"The most well known of Puligny's premier cru vineyards, Les Combettes is at the very heart of the slope. This central position shows in this dense and concentrated wine that's big, powerful and marked by fresh fruit-salad flavors of green figs, green apple and spice. The whole is borne up by a fine, solid structure of wood and tannins.",France
10217,France,"This is the smallest of the grand crus of Puligny-Montrachet, a mere 8.6 acres. This wine shows the vineyard's typical elegance, with delicious flavors of pears,  almonds and vanilla, hovering on the palate for minutes, leaving a dancing freshness.",France
10218,France,"The pinnacle of the white wines from Roux Père et Fils, this is  properly opulent, gorgeously rich, spicy and full of quince and lychee flavors, along with a discrete layer of new wood. Its complexity pays due respect to the quality of the vineyard. Keep for many years.",France
10219,France,"Rich and ample, this is an impressive wine. The fruit and wood flavors work together to give a feeling of seriousness and great ageability. With its spice, toast notes and dark-hued structure, this will age well over the next five to 10 years.",France
10220,France,"Relatively closed up at this stage, not giving much, this wine is all about freshness, poised but rich fruit and a structure that suggests long-term development. The wood is quite prominent, overshadowing what will be delicious yellow-fruit flavors. Come back to this wine in five years—it will be magnificent.",France
10221,France,"Bâtard-Montrachet is the largest of the white grand crus, yielding archetypal fat, open, generous white Burgundies. Louis Jadot's wine does not disappoint. It's a powerfully ripe, opulent wine that's generous and packed with delicious fruit balanced with a judicious touch of wood.",France
10222,France,"Relatively tight and closed up at this stage, this wine is all about freshness, poised but rich fruit and a structure that suggests long-term development. The wood is quite prominent, overshadowing what will be delicious yellow-fruit flavors. Come back to this wine in 5 years time—it will be magnificent.",France
10223,France,"While the wood aromas dominate, on the palate, there is a much richer, rounder character. This wine, with its huge fruit, white peach flavors, layers of wood and citrus, is just waiting to burst out of its youth. Delicious ripeness and acidity lend balance, while the oak needs some time to calm down and mature.",France
10224,France,"An intense, complex wine that flows unctuously with rich white fruits, spice, vanilla, some toast and a great depth of flavor. At this stage, the toast is quite dominant, but the rich fruit is on its way up. Like many great white Burgundies, this wine needs to be opened well in advance of drinking.",France
10225,France,"Like many wines from Lafon, this is initially deceptive. It bursts open in the mouth, like a fruit bomb. But watch for the structure as well, because this is a wine that will age. Keep for at least 5 years.",US
10226,France,"A structured wine that is going to need 4 or 5 years to really open up. Already there is power and intense green-fruit flavors, but at the moment new-wood flavors are dominant. Don't drink now.",France
10227,France,"Blending grapes from two vineyards—Les Case-Têtes (broken heads, so called from the steepness of the slope) and Les Murgers de Monthelie—Patrick Javillier has created a big, bold, ripe wine that keeps a mineral, crisp center. The toast from 11 months in wood is beginning to calm down, and this will age magnificently.",France
10228,France,"Full, but structured, this is a wine that shows a serious side to Meursault. It layers fine stone-fruit flavors with crisp apple skins and some fresh toast and butter. It should improve over 5 years.",France
10229,France,"This delicious, crisp wine reveals the more delicate side of Chardonnay. Coming from one of the high vineyards in La Grande Montagne of Chassagne, it has pure, elegant freshness, supplemented by a touch of vanilla.",US
10230,France,"Offers very soft fruit, open and rounded. There is some acidity, some flavor of melon and pears complemented with toast and an edge of citrus. The finish is lightly mineral.",France
10231,France,"Made from 60-year-old vines, evidenced by its concentration and serious ageability. It is structured, firm and relatively dry at this young stage. It's a wine that needs at least 5 years. Today, if you do open a bottle, watch for the mineral, stony character that pushes the fruit and demands attention.",France
10232,France,"The reputation of Les Combettes for charm is borne out by this deliciously ripe wine. It has layers of fresh fruit flavors, a touch of spice from the wood, and a long aftertaste. And, for the future, the acidity and the underlying structure promise at least 5 years of evolution.",France
10233,France,"You can almost taste the stones that give this vineyard its name. This is a mineral, firm, tight wine that demands time to develop. The fruit is there, with flavors of white currants, but wait for this wine—at least four years.",France
10234,France,"A crisp, steely, minerally wine that's packed with fruit that is poised to come out over the next few years. It is firm, taut and on a tight rein at this stage. Oak gives a spicy element. Keep for at least three years.",France
10235,France,"An intense, well-balanced wine with deliciously ripe yet lively green-fruit flavors. The wood is integrated, providing a cushioning richness to what is already a delicious wine. Girardin owns 3.7 acres in Les Folatières.",France
10236,France,"The complexities of Burgundy! This is the vineyard next to the more familiar Les Charmes, just up the slope—hence dessus, meaning above. This vineyard gives a mineral character, hinting at Chablis, but with some Meursault richness as well. Hold this wine, with its delicious vanilla flavors, and it will be ready in a year.",France
10237,France,"Full-bodied, big-hearted, ripe and joyful, this is a welcoming, enticing wine. Flavors of green plums, nutmeg and fresh citrus are part of the pleasure. But so are the open, generous, almost opulent flavors.",France
10238,France,"A ripe, open, generous wine, the opulent side of white Burgundy. This wine revels in its fruit, full flavors and touch of wood. This wine opens well and is ready to drink now, but should age over 4–5 years.",France
10239,France,"It's not a bad name for this vineyard—Charmes. This wine, which expresses the nature of the vineyard, is certainly approachable, friendly almost. But there's also a steel fist there that demands time. And if you can't wait, it's a great wine to drink now.",France
10240,France,"New-wood aromas, plenty of spice and yellow fruits, but also a beautifully-shaped wine. It's complex yet generous, ripe yet elegant. For village Meursault, this is excellent.",France
10241,France,"Pierre Morey also runs a small negociant business, Morey Blanc, specializing in whites from Meursault. This is one of the wines, a delicious, fresh, crisp wine that's packed with light, airy flavors of green apples and citrus.",France
10242,France,"There are at least four vineyards in Meursault called Charmes. Wines called Les Charmes can use fruit from both Les Charmes Dessus (above) and Les Charmes Dessous (below). This wine from René Monnier shows round, luscious fruit flavors balanced with some spicy toast and richness. The wine is ready to drink.",France
10243,France,"Coming from the largest of the Puligny premier crus, this is a big, bold, ripe wine.  Still structured at this young stage, but generous and packed with green plum and lime flavors. The wood gives tannins but doesn't dominate.",France
10244,France,"In the fat, buttery style of white Burgundy, this wine, with its malolactic flavors and its vanilla flavors, would appeal immediately to California Chardonnay lovers. Except that it also has elegance: a hint of steel and a touch of acidity to temper the tropical fruits.",France
10245,France,"From the Bouchard domaine, this wine is soft and ripe. There is some structure and firm acidity, but that's secondary to the luscious flavors that roll around the mouth. The wood broadens but also gives extra complexity to the wine.",France
10246,France,"Chenevottes is situated high up on the Chassagne-Montrachet slope, above the grand cru vineyards. With its fat, ripe butter and coconut milk character, this wine offers an immediately appealing style. But there is a hint of ageability in its layers of serious wood and structure.",US
10247,France,"A wine that caresses the palate with initial silky, ripe-fruit flavors and then comes on with structure and acidity. The wood shows through but certainly doesn't dominate. A wine that has power, but also great charm.",France
10248,France,"Rich and spiced with wood flavors, this is a rounded, powerful wine. The flavors suggest kiwis and pears leading to vanilla and caramel. It is developing well and is ready to drink.",France
10249,France,"Still tasting young, and not yet showing all its power, this is still an impressive wine. It is firm and structured, with citrus and mineral flavors dominating the concentrated fruit. The wood shows through via a warm spiciness. This will certainly age for 5 years or more.",France
10250,France,"This shows the more racy, fresh side of Meursault. It's a wine that dances and jumps around the mouth. Light but still full of delicious green fruits. The wood is there, but it's such a delicate touch.",France
10251,France,"A lively, almost racy wine that has delicious ripe fruit, lovely fresh acidity, lemon and green-apple flavors and an appealing layer of new wood. Chardonnay lovers, this is for you.",France
10252,France,"Ripe and at the same time structured, this wine is as broad as its palate is long. It envelops the mouth with nutmeg and almonds as well as white fruits and ripe acidity. It's delicious now, but there's structure to allow it a few years aging.",France
10253,France,"Big, intense and ripe, this wine has great flavors of ripe apples, almonds and honey from the malolactic fermentation. It is poised, elegant and powerful—a balance that is the best of many worlds. From the Roux domaine, it is finely crafted and likely to age for many years.",France
10254,France,"Perhaps the best-known of the Chassagne-Montrachet premier crus, Morgeot is a wine that delights the taste buds. Moreau's example has enticing flowery aromas, ripe red apple and fresh almond flavors, and a friendly, open character that is tempered with some fresh acidity.",France
10255,France,"Like so many Drouhin wines, this is beautifully balanced. The wood, green fruit, spice and acidity already in fine harmony. There is a richness coming from the deep soils of the vineyard. Can it age? Probably, because of the firm structure.",France
10256,France,"With its sandstone soil, the Abbaye de Morgeot vineyard is equally suited to Pinot Noir as to Chardonnay. But it is able to produce fresh, fruity wines, like this one. A spice and citric blend dances on the palate.",France
10257,France,"Producing some of the more refined wines of Meursault, Charmes also has the right amount of opulence. Louis Latour's wine brings out all the richness and ripeness; soft, generous and full-bodied and leavened with spicy wood flavors.",France
10258,France,"Perrières is often described as the greatest of the premier crus of Meursault. Wines like this certainly need aging, with their structure overlying the typical opulence of Meursault. It's possible to enjoy this now, but it would be worth waiting 3–4 years at least.",US
10259,France,"Leflaive owns a small parcel of vines in the Clos Saint-Marc and also buys grapes from neighbors. The wine is ripe, but still has restraint, with flavors of green plums and a touch of spice. A firm structure promises aging, and there's a delicious fresh zing to the finish.",France
10260,France,"More steely than some Meursault, this layers wood and mineral flavors with a fine structure and tastes of apple skins and nutmeg. This wine could age 3–4 years, but it is already delicious.",France
10261,France,"Elegance is the hallmark of this wine, which flows round the mouth with generous flavors but still leaves a fresh, crisp aftertaste. Green apples, spice and wood all balance well.",France
10262,France,"Blagny is a small hamlet just up the hill from Les Perrières. This is a cooler spot, and the wine shows this with its structure and flavors of fresh green fruits over generous portions of wood. A wine that should age for more than 5 years.",France
10263,France,"From the domaine of Pierre Morey, who is also cellarmaster at Domaine Leflaive. Like at Leflaive, he works his vines biodynamically. This is a layered wine; the pure, crisp fruit partnering with light toast flavors and a poised and structured apple-skin aftertaste.",France
10264,France,"Ripe, open and packed with melon and tropical fruit flavors, this wine is already showing enticing drinkability. Its fresh, ripe fruits is layered with some mineral character and an under-cushion of wood.",France
10265,France,"For a village wine, this is impressive. The richness and ripeness of the grapes translates into a full wine with white- fruit and spice flavors. But quite properly, there is a fine, poised mineral streak from the chalk soil that gives the wine shape and balance.",France
10266,France,"Rich, buttery and forward, but with a fine streak of minerality to give structure and interest. The wood gives a spicy character to the wine, but it doesn't dominate the rich burst of fruit.",France
10267,France,"From a small parcel of village vines in Puligny-Montrachet, Domaine de la Vougeraie has fashioned an intense wine that balances ripe but crisp green plum and toast flavors. It is concentrated and already well integrated.",France
10268,France,"Ripe, open and elegant. A glorious burst of lemon, peaches, nectarines and acidity. There is some wood—not new—but the fruit is everything here.",France
10269,France,"A Meursault-based domaine that has progressed rapidly in quality under Philippe Ballot. This Genevrières is a rich, young wine that promises an open, ripe, wood-layered series of flavors in 2 years.",France
10270,France,"A full, rounded wine with yellow fruit and citrus flavors lying over vanilla and toast flavors. This rich wine is ready to drink despite a good touch of minerality to finish.",France
10271,France,"Sweet, full-fruit flavors and elegance mark this friendly wine. The wood flavors blend effortlessly with the citrus and kiwi fruit, leaving a fresh, lifted aftertaste. The 2004 marks a good return to form after the less successful 2003s from this domaine.",France
10272,France,"Round and generous, but with a mineral heart that gives structure to this full wine. It has weight, dense fruit and delicious peach and nectarine flavors. The structure suggests this Morgeot has the potential to age.",France
10273,France,"What a delicious, drinkable wine with peach and fresh-fruit flavors, a touch of pineapple and a touch of almonds. Relish the wine now, or enjoy over the next 5 years.",US
10274,France,"From the home vineyard of the Lafon family, right in front of the house, this is ripe and full, with layers of new wood among the open fruit. Finishes fresh, generous and demanding to be drunk soon.",France
10275,France,"Powerful, intense wood aromas dominate this wine initially. But on the palate, there are also fruit flavors that push at the wood, giving delicious apricot,  white fruits and some honey to go along with the vanilla tastes.",France
10276,France,"Beautiful  green-plum flavored fruit shows how good Saint-Aubin can be. The vanilla flavors from wood fermentation and aging simply underline the pure, vivid flavors. Drink in three to 10 years.",France
10277,France,"This is a great Meursault that's full of round, ripe, generous fruit. It's packed with yellow fruit and kiwi flavors. Revel in its richness. This wine comes from Bouchard's own vines.",France
10278,France,"High up on the slope, the Sous le Puits vineyard has produced a ripe, open, buttery wine that is full of generous, opulent fruit. It is packed with pineapple, tropical fruit and lime flavors, along with a hint of caramel and almonds. Ready to drink now.",US
10279,France,"Very rich, ripe and packed with new-wood flavors, this is somewhat flashy, but it's still delicious to drink. Sit back and enjoy.",France
10280,France,"This comes from the negociant side of Pierre Morey's business. It is full, rich, fat, open and quite opulent. Yes, the acidity and the freshness of the fruit are there, but this is a generous wine that will develop relatively quickly over 2 to 3 years.",France
10281,France,"This is a dense structured wine with some herbal flavors as well as kiwi and green plums. Fruit dominates, leaving the wood with a walk-on part. It is developing slowly and needs another 2–3 years to open fully.",France
10282,France,"A spicy, nutty wine that shows some of the Meursault broadness but also offers some subtlety, with ripe fruits layered with more complex wood and herb flavors. This could age well over the next 2–3 years.",France
10283,France,"A big, fat wine that lives up to the popular image of Meursault. Perhaps it could do with a little more depth of flavor, but it's a ripe glassful of Chardonnay now.",France
10284,France,"This is a lively, fresh wine with good acidity, a touch of toast under the fruit and a great burst of energy and zing in the aftertaste.",France
10285,France,"The typical fat, buttery flavors are balanced here by elegance and freshness. With its honey, melon and pear tastes, come fresh acidity and a underlying layer of vanilla from the wood.",France
10286,France,"Aromas of toast dominate this wine, but the palate is better balanced with citrus and apple flavors. But it does need time for the wood to calm and to integrate. Don't confuse this Machard de Gramont with the one owned by Bertrand Machard de Gramont—this is Burgundy.",France
10287,France,"Rich and accessible, this is a rounded, buttery wine with fine, sweet acidity and delicious open fruit. It just demands to be enjoyed.",France
10288,France,"A soft, open wine with some vanilla flavors emphasizing the opulence of Meursault. The wine is ready to drink now.",US
10289,France,"A firm, quite mineral style of wine, perhaps austere at this stage. With the lurking wood flavors, this promises to open out in 2 years, giving a concentrated, compact wine.",France
10290,France,This wine shows crisp citric fruit allied to layers of spicy wood. Then it opens with some ripe white fruits and thirst-quenching acidity. It should age well over 3–4 years. The Abbaye de Morgeot vineyard is in the southern part of the appellation.,France
10291,France,"Steely and minerally, but also has fresh white and yellow fruit flavors. Bright acidity finishes this highly drinkable wine.",France
10292,France,"A village Meursault, but one which has been treated like a cru, with layers of ripe wood balancing  the pure green- and white-fruit flavors. This is ready to drink now as it is well balanced and deliciously fresh.",France
10293,France,"A wood-dominated wine, with spice and toast. The citrus and white fruit element is very much subdued. The aftertaste continues on the same theme—dry tannins from the wood. Give it a few months and the balance should be better.",France
10294,France,"This is an enjoyable wine, open and soft, with crisp white and yellow fruits, a touch of citrus and a touch of wood to give it all shape. Drink now.",France
10295,France,"A fruit-driven wine that balances a flinty character with flavors of green plums. It is fresh, light, poised, crisp and green.",France
10296,France,"Although this comes from a vineyard outside the Meursault appellation, the vines are tended with the same care as any Meursault vineyard. The wine is rich, with flavors of almonds and lemon. Rounded out with a light application of wood.",France

10299,France,"A lively, fresh and relatively light wine, showing the soft and easy side of Charmes. It is ready to drink but without the opulence of some wines from this vineyard.",France
10300,France,"Joseph Belland is based in neighboring Santenay, where the estate produces red wines. But this wine, from right next door in Chassagne, is a fine, ripe wine with some vanilla aromas and a rich texture balanced by some easy acidity.",France
10301,France,"This soft wine shows  fresh, easy acidity and pineapple flavors. The wine opens fully in the mouth; it's like a sunburst of fruit and citrus, with just a touch of wood.",France
10302,France,"Roux Père et Fils, based in Saint-Aubin, has done much to enhance the reputation of the appellation. This wine shows the potential of the ripe fruit that can be produced in a year such as 2004. Perhaps the winemaker was carried away by new wood, but that should tone down in a year.",France
10303,France,"This wine hasn't quite settled down yet. There is still some rusticity to it, which at the moment detracts from what is obviously rich fruit. Give it a year.",France
10304,France,"A fresh, light, crisp wine with some good mineral overtones layered with toast. While it doesn't have great complexity, this is an attractive, citrusy wine that's ready to drink now.",France

10308,France,"This village wine is full of ripe, open tropical fruits and an attractive caramel touch. The whole is wrapped in clean acidity and a delicious lift to the finish.",US
10309,France,"Full and fat, this wine has pleasant white-fruit flavors. It is fresh, but rather unfocused, with toast coming through the fruit to dominate the aftertaste.",US
10310,France,"This is the first vintage of a wine produced from a 22-acre estate bought by Anne-Claude Leflaive of Domaine Leflaive in Puligny-Montrachet. This is packed with deliciously fresh apples and cream flavors, yet it's very intense and crisp. The ripeness of the fruit is balanced by an elegant aftertaste.",France
10311,France,"A clean, fresh, attractively rounded wine that's rich, buttery and demanding to be drunk. Vincent Bouzereau is one of the many Bouzereaus in Meursault with a tradition of grape growing over many generations.",France
10312,France,"An easy wine that's soft, fresh and simple, but one which has the merit of being drinkable and affordable. The yellow fruit flavors are rounded out with a touch of wood, and soft there's acidity to finish.",France
10313,France,"Already, this is a drinkable wine, soft, lightly wooded, fresh and clean. There's attractive acidity to give the whole thing a lift.",France
10314,France,"Although this wine is initially unfocused, the palate does show some pleasing rounded fruits and a touch of citrus and wood. Drink now.",France
10315,France,"Big and powerful, this is the grandest of the grand crus. It has both  a dense structure and overwhelming fruits. With minerality, spice and balance, this is a very complete wine. There is only a hint of the richness to come. Hold for 10 years at least.",France
10316,France,"This is the epitome of great Chablis, with minerality, initial austerity and coiled power. It is a dense, tense wine, structured with both toasty tannins and green fruits that shine out of all this concentration. Age for 7–10 years.",France
10317,France,"There is much concentration and freshness here, along with much power and intense minerality. The wine is very rich with butter, ripe fruit and layers of considerable acidity. Wait 6 years at least.",France
10318,France,"Often seen as the easiest of the grand crus because of its richness, this shows more power due to the vintage. There is some tightness to the ripe structure, with white currant, pear skin and spice flavors. Finishes with sweet acidity.",France
10319,France,"Using the old name for Bougros, this is from the steepest portion of the Bougros vineyard. The pure chalk soil gives it pronounced minerality, and it shows firm structure, with green apples, toast and a very firm, tight character. This wine definitely needs to age; give it 5–8 years.",France
10320,France,"This flagship wine is Laroche's selection from the best wines of Les Blanchots. At this stage, it is young, its aromas mineral and crisp, but its future generous richness is very evident. It will be an intensely powerful expression of Chardonnay, touched by wood, and leaving great concentration. Screwcap.",France
10321,France,"Elegance is the key to this wine. The fruit, acidity and wood are all finely in balance, leading to a tight structure of green fruits and oak, balanced by great freshness. It is a fine, tight wine, but potentially rich.",France
10322,France,"Initially this is closed up, then the wood and the superbly rich fruit assert themselves, unfolding into toast, lime, tropical fruits, plums and a dense, fresh acidity. It is still coming together, working up to being a superb wine. Give it 10 years.",France
10323,France,"Touched by wood, this wine is more about the huge, rich fruit flavors; the yellow peaches and mangoes are balanced with a defined citrus element. Rich, but given structure from the crisp grapefruit flesh and red apples.",France
10324,France,"A very warm, generous, ripe wine, this comes from the most precocious of the grand cru vineyards. It is packed with yellow fruits, rich and open. This is opulence in a glass, boosted by toast and spice.",France
10325,France,"A concentrated, hugely rich wine with lively caramel and toast aromas, followed by ripe fruits. It is generous and open, with apricots and nectarines giving richness, while kiwi gives the green, crisp character. The aftertaste is all minerality. Screwcap.",France
10326,France,"A honeyed wine, soft and ripe. There is butter and toast, and acidity in the way of white fruits with only touches of citrus. Very round, this wine is almost ready to drink now, with its concentrated fullness and richness.",France
10327,France,"Structured and tight, this is a powerful wine, dominated by wood aromas and white fruit, with spice, wood and green herb flavors. There's a smokiness that comes from the soil, and to finish, very pure green fruits.",France
10328,France,"This is pure mineral, chalk and lean austerity initially, but opens up with apples,  lime and green plums. It is intense, concentrated and structured; needs time. Wait 4–5 years.",France
10329,France,"The 18 acres of Château de Grenouilles are a monopoly of the La Chablisienne cooperative. A huge, ripe wine, very fruity, with yellow peaches. The richness is balanced with a steely core of minerality. Lively acidity finishes this impressive wine.",France
10330,France,"This is an elegant, refined style of wine, with all the elements in balance. There is wood, green and white fruits, fresh acidity and repressed power. This is a Chablis style that needs aging—give it at least 5 years.",France
10331,France,"This is so closed up at the moment, all mineral and steel, that it is hard to feel the ripeness of the tropical fruit. As this develops, it will flesh out the yellow fruits, balancing the acidity. The aftertaste is already thirst quenching.",France
10332,France,"This tight, steely wine is austere initially, but opens up to show concentrated richness, with flavors of white currants, vivid green fruits and crisp, intense acidity. Obviously a wine that needs age—4 years at least.",France
10333,France,"Very firm, this is a structured, relatively austere wine, with lots of minerality and tightness. The green fruits are  pierced with acidity, but also very fresh. A wine that needs time, give this at least 5–6 years. Screwcap.",France
10334,France,"Intensity is the keyword here: the butter, toast and ripe yellow fruits are both ripe and powerful. There's some spice, balanced with acidity, finishing so fresh, young and crisp.",France
10335,France,"Open, generous and relatively opulent, showing all the richness of 2005, along with peaches, apricots and tropical fruits. It's round from start to finish, a luscious Chardonnay. Just some crispness at the end.",France
10336,France,"This wine shows that top Chablis should be aged. This is like tasting the barebones of the wine without the flesh that is still very hidden. There is suppressed power, as well as green acidity and potential richness. Wait 5 years.",France
10337,France,"This shows how Dauvissat's wines need to age. At the moment, this is closed up, only hinting at its almost tropical richness, ripe yellow fruits and some white currants, but still kept in balance with acidity and minerality.",France
10338,France,"This is a wine that speaks of its terroir, the chalk soil coming out in a very mineral, austere character. It has elegance, class, great style of poise, showing acidity, fresh green fruits and a need to age for at least 5 years.",France
10339,France,"Lively but rich, this balances freshness, crispness and minerality with dense, delicious fruits. There are caramel and white fruit flavors, along with intense structure. This should age for 3–4 years. Screwcap.",France
10340,France,"A glorious outpouring of beautifully crafted Chardonnay, opulent but tightly mineral. The ripe apple and pear character has a delicate, elegant squeeze of lime, while the whole wine is underpinned by wood. No doubt for long-term aging.",France
10341,France,"From arguably the finest white wine vineyard in Burgundy, this is a powerful wine that shows great weight, but balances that with intense, elegant structure, style and freshness. The flavors are endless and complex, richness combining with the lively character of the vintage. Age for many years.",France
10342,France,"A powerful wine, showing rich, opulent Chardonnay. The spice and acidity crispen the wine, but leave the powerful fruit in all its glory.",France
10343,France,"From a parcel within the Chevalier-Montrachet vineyard, this is beautifully balanced, but a wine with considerable potential. It is rich, but thrust through with a sword of steel, giving acidity that offers a succulent counterpoint to the yellow fruits. The wood is becoming well integrated, offering further richness. For long-term aging.",France
10344,France,"From the largest of the Chablis Grand Cru, this wine shows a lively fruit character but also a powerful, taut mineral streak that comes through to dominate. There is no doubt this needs aging, with its steely edge and vivid acidity.",France
10345,France,"From a parcel that used to belong to the Hospices in Chablis until purchased by the Moreau family. It is a beautifully fashioned wine, its steely character rounded out with delicious ripe fruits, green apples, pear skin and kiwi fruit. Impressive and for aging.",France
10346,France,"Surprisingly open for a 2005, this shows wood through its intense green fruit. It is rounded, generous, almost opulent with tropical fruits as well as plums, and shot through with citrus. This will develop faster than other Brocard Grand Crus.",France
10347,France,"A very vibrant, lively wine, all mineral and fresh acidity. There is some austerity  as the fruit still needs to round out; but it promises to develop well, with delicious green apple and grapefruit flavors. Keep this for 3–4 years.",France
10348,France,"Steeliness exemplified in wine. This is crisp and structured, complex with its green fruits, structured acidity and touch of caramel and kiwi. It's the acidity that shows at the moment; needs 4–5 years.",France
10349,France,"Intital bright, green fruit aromas on this concentrated, intense style of wine, with some smoky flavors to complement the crisp, green freshness. It's a very complete wine, well balanced, with all of the fruits in place along with spice.",France
10350,France,"Regarded in Chablis as almost a grand cru vineyard, Vaulorent has produced a superconcentrated wine, layering minerals, yellow fruits and pear skin structure touched lightly by caramel. There is great acidity throughout this impressive wine.",France
10351,France,"There's a luscious outer edge to this wine, with mango and peach flavors freshened with citrus. But at its dense core, it is all mineral, flinty, the wood present but certainly not dominant. It needs time, maybe 3–4 years.",France
10352,France,"A beautiful wine that floats its minerality, white flower aromas and white currant fruits over a foundation of toast. Freshness dominates this crisp wine, with intensity to finish.",France
10353,France,"This is a rare premier cru vineyard with its north-east exposure. In good years, like 2005, it can produce a wonderful expression of the mineral structure of fine Chablis. Apple and grapefruit flavors are at the forefront here; this certainly needs to age for 5–6 years.",France
10354,France,"Straddling richness and beautiful liveliness, this is going to be an impressive wine. It does need aging. At this stage, the wood is a big element, but then the bright white fruits—pears, white currants along with tangerines—will move center stage. Keep at least six years, almost certainly more.",France
10355,France,"The flagship wine from Bichot's Long-Depaquit estate is, as usual, impressive. It has richness, balance, full white fruits with just a hint of steeliness. Powered by a citrus acidity, it looks likely to age well over several years.",France
10356,France,"A ripe, bold and impressive wine, showing yellow peaches and pineapple flavors to go with its tight core of minerality. There is a touch of wood, but the main thrust is for broad fruit, open and welcoming.",France
10357,France,"A bright, steely wine with great concentration and a tight, mineral character. This is impressive Grand Cru Chablis for the long term, based for the moment on lime, almonds and green plums, but itching to broaden out.",France
10358,France,"Big and weighty, the wood very dominant, a wine with considerable potential. It feels important, seriously structured, edging on austere, but promising a much broader character after several years.",France
10359,France,"Tight and still young, a wine that brings out the intense acidity of the vintage, hiding its power and potential at the moment. But both are there, offering a concentrated wine that will develop slowly as befits its Grand Cru status.",US
10360,France,"Still tasting young, with its lemon and lime flavors dominant, this is going to be a serious, mineral-driven wine. It has plenty of fruit, but it is caged in a firm, tight texture of green fruits. Obviously it needs aging.",France
10361,France,"There is definite gravitas in this big wine. It has the proper power of a Corton-Charlemagne and is a rich and concentrated wine that shows big fruits, a fine cut of acidity and layered wood. A wine for the long term.",France
10362,France,"A firm, tight wine, still young, still not showing all the roundness and weight that is potentially there. This is a wine that needs decanting, offering some good aging potential.",US
10363,France,"At this stage, the wine is closed up, the fruit quite tight. But it is extremely rich, the potential from the spice, broad white fruits and intense minerality all promising good aging.",France
10364,France,"A simple, fresh, citrusy wine with attractive floral aromas. There are flavors of kiwis and white peaches, which give an attractive lift.",France
10365,France,"Very concentrated and closed up, like a coil. The intense green fruit is followed by plum skins. Crispness, dry but fresh, comes alongside a powerful explosion of flavors.",France
10366,France,"As so often with Mont-de-Milieu, this is a powerful, majestic wine, rich and ripe. The fruit is generous and dense, tinged with some citrus, flint honey and toast. Very full.",France
10367,France,"La Chablisienne vinifies this portion of Fourchaume premier cru separately, regarding it as almost grand cru in power. It is certainly a concentrated wine, very ripe, but lined with citrus acidity, crispness and structure. At the end, though, the richness comes out.",France
10368,France,"Grapefruit and other citrus fruits come through the rich fruit. There is power and crispness here, along with a sense of structure from the mineral, flinty character that underlies the fruit. Hold for for 3–4 years.",France
10369,France,"A solid, firmly structured, mineral wine, buoyed up by wood. It is very intense, nervous, just poised between richness and power. The yellow fruits, green plum skin acidity and the grapefruit crispness all blend well together.",France
10370,France,"Generous in style, with great freshness. The flavors are rich, touched by caramel, ripe white currants and some spice. A fine, red apple skin structure comes through to finish.",France
10371,France,"Open, generous and packed with butter and honey. Yellow fruits are the dominant character, touched with toast and ripeness. This is an opulent and full wine.",France
10372,France,"Concentrated, dense, powerful and full of glistening green fruits, this wine is lightly touched with caramel, but more dominated by ripe acidity. The aftertaste is tight, suggesting good aging potential.",France
10373,France,"Weighty, full-bodied, full of ripe yellow fruits. Here's a wine that is going to be a powerhouse, packed with intense flavors, touched by wood and a crisp edge. The aftertaste leaves minerality along with the ripe fruit.",France
10374,France,"A light, easy wine with some fresh green fruits. It is ready to drink. A soft, friendly wine.",US
10375,France,"This steep vineyard produces a particularly rich style of Chablis because of its excellent exposure. This wine exemplifies this. It is warm, and rounded, with superrich yellow fruits, almost tropical. Underlying it all is a structure derived from green plum skin flavors.",France
10376,France,"This is the second wine from the Château Grenouilles vineyard, very fresh, but at the same time weighty and concentrated, with wood, caramel and generous fruits. Age for 5 years.",France
10377,France,"This is Jean-Pierre Grossot's flagship wine. From around an acre of the Mont de Milieu vineyard, he produces an intensely ripe wine that pulls toward great minerality and steeliness. There is power as well, with just touches of wood.",France
10378,France,"With 24 acres in this premier cru vineyard, Laroche is able to produce this mineral- and grapefruit-flavored wine in good quantities. There is a touch of caramel, balanced with excellent lively acidity. A fresh but full-bodied wine that will age well over the next 2–3 years. Screwcap.",France
10379,France,"Aromas of nuts and honey, with smooth, soft flavors. This wine has ripeness along with crisp acidity. It is pure in fruit, without a hint of wood.",France
10380,France,"Citrus aromas and grapefruit flavors make this fresh, simple wine pleasing and attractive. This wine shows a style that has made Chablis so popular around the world.",France
10381,France,"Made from young vines from the Vaulorent portion of the Fourchaume vineyard, this is an open, rounded and lively wine with white fruits and weight, just lifted by acidity.",France
10382,France,"There's a fine balance here between minerality and rich toast. The result is a very pure but ripe wine, dominated by a good mix of ripe white fruits and honey.",France
10383,France,"Initially this is caramel and fresh fruit layered with acidity. Then the minerality kicks in with a vengeance, structuring the ripe green flavors, and leaving tense acidity.",France
10384,France,"A big, toasty wine, full of ripe, delicious fruit, veering toward opulence. There are open yellow fruits along with toast and butter tastes. This is almost ready to drink now; only the acidity promises some aging.",France
10385,France,"Closed up and firm with a hint of vanilla, honey and refined acidity. There is some crispness here, green apples and a plum skin character. This is going to be serious Chardonnay; the minerality already in evidence.",France
10386,France,"This is definitely young, but the fresh fruit is already very apparent. There's a lifted, vibrant apple character that opens in the mouth to give yellow fruits with a finish of steel and gun flint sharpness.",France
10387,France,"This goes for the tropical fruit side of Chardonnay, a big mouthful of round, rich fruit, yellow pears, apricots, lifted by a touch of kiwi. There is a final crispness to keep the whole fruit salad in order.",France
10388,France,"A rounded, fruity wine, packed with yellow peaches and apricots, but held in check by freshness, green herbs and a firm, steely character. It's not a wine to age for long, but it is delicious, and very seductive now.",France
10389,France,"From old vines, at least 50 years old, this shows good concentration, giving a dense, ripe, rounded wine full of green apple fruits, hints of vanilla and streaks of minerality.",France
10390,France,"For simple Chablis, this is impressive, rich, fruity, with wood as well as lively, fresh acidity. Nosings find toast and butter, with a hint of light honey.",France
10391,France,"A soft, ripe, open wine with yellow fruit flavors. There is opulent concentration, velvet in texture. Only on the finish is there freshness and real acidity. Screwcap.",France
10392,France,"This still tastes impressively young for a simple Chablis. In fact it isn't simple at all, showing all the intensity of a premier cru with its minerality, fresh lime and other citrus flavors, hints of honey and white fruits.",France
10393,France,"An open, full and fleshy wine, with just a hint of mineral character. It is round, flavored with white pears, almonds and finishing with crisp layers of acidity. The complexity is still developing.",France
10394,France,"A complex wine that is influenced by wood, but shows more of fresh lime and white currants. There's intense acidity, lifted green flavors and a round aftertaste.",France
10395,France,"This is a cool cru, which shows even in this great year with its structure, austerity and steely character. It makes it old-style Chablis, with its green fruits and lively, poised freshness.",France
10396,France,"Strong minerality with crisp, clean almost mouth-puckering green fruits that show structure. It is full-bodied and rich, but also with an edge of austerity.",France
10397,France,"This is light and floral both with its aromas and its palate. In the heart of the wine is a firm, crisp mineral layer, which blends into the apple skin and caramel, vanilla flavors. Drink 2009.",France
10398,France,"A blend from a number of premier cru vineyards, pulling together cooler and warmer sites in balance. It's fresh and light, showing elegance, green fruits and a floral character. Just a touch of minerality.",France
10399,France,"It must be the older vines, but compared to the simpler version of this wine, this has a firm structure of apple skins that goes well with the clean taste, the mouth-wateringly fresh acidity and green plum fruits.",US
10400,France,"A concentrated wine, just beginning to open up, with a serious, maybe austere mineral element, as well as vibrant kiwi and citrus flavors. It is softened by aging in older wood, giving some roundness to finish.",France
10401,France,"With superripe fruit, fat and glossy, with rich white fruits, round, dense and concentrated, this is a wine to ooze into the glass. It is perhaps not very Chablis, but delicious as a fine Chardonnay.",France
10402,France,"The extra amount of clay in the soil of this vineyard lends weight, richness and roundness. At the same time, it has fresh lime, an open character and a soft structure.",France
10403,France,"From a vineyard run on biodynamic principles, this wine boasts good, fresh fruit, with great green, crisp acidity and green plum intensity. It's very lively and fresh, but full-bodied.",France
10404,France,"For a Petit Chablis, this is serious and complex, with delicious ripe green and yellow fruits; there is a touch of caramel with toast just at the edge.",France
10405,France,"Named after the river that flows past Chablis, this is a ripe, fruity wine, with yellow fruit flavors and good ripeness. Unoaked, it has good concentration as well as richness.",France
10406,France,"The name “Not so little” is a joking reference to its appellation. This is a pleasure, a delicious unoaked Chardonnay with green fruits, a touch of caramel and kiwi fruit flavors.",France
10407,France,"Full, in a rich style, this is a ripe wine packed with juicy green fruits. There are pears, ripe apple skins and a good citrus edge. A fresh, easily drinkable wine.",France
10408,France,"A ripe, crisp, very fresh Chablis bursting with green fruits, with a light layer of caramel and green herbs. Delicious now.",France

10410,France,"Lively and fresh, this shows all the crispness of young, unwooded Chardonnay, touched with vanilla and simple green fruits. Drink now.",France
10411,France,"Toasty and nutty on the nose, this is a lush, fruit-filled Burgundy that nevertheless retains a sense of minerality amid its baked-apple flavors. It's plump and custardy in texture, with ample power and concentration, turning minerally on the finish.",France
10412,France,"A simple, fresh wine, with flavors of crisp, green apples and a touch of pear. It is light, poised, clean and ready to drink.",France
10413,France,"Somewhat earthy and rustic, this is a fresh wine, with citrus notes and some yeastiness. The wine's fruit has finishing liveliness and crispness.",US
10414,France,"The latest release from Salon, this just explodes in the mouth with mineral, steel and flint. The tiny mousse has flavors of yeast and just a touch of toast. It is rich, but so austere and structured. Like many Salon Champagnes, this will age for 20 years or more.",France
10415,France,"While the Larmandier's main vineyard is in Vertus, they also have a parcel in the grand cru vineyard of Cramant. It is full of beautifully ripe fruit, beginning to round out as it ages. Green fruits and white pears, as well as yeast are still dominant; drink 2010.",France
10416,France,"Although this is marked nonvintage, the fruit all comes from 2004. It is made from old vines, giving richness and ripeness, and a generous white fruit character which fully compensates for the very dry nature of the wine. It's delicious, a complex wine of intense character.",France
10417,France,"Based mainly on vines in Le Mesnil-sur-Oger, this impressive wine is superbly rich with just the merest hint of age. With its lively mousse, secondary aromas of mocha and flavors of green apples, it is a wine that should develop magnificently over the next 4–5 years.",US
10418,France,"Made entirely from grand cru grapes, this is a beautiful wine, layering toast and ripe fruit with a proper minerality from the year. Flavors of honey, toast and nougat soften the aftertaste. It is ready to drink now, but it has still a ways to go, as the intense concentration of fruit opens out.",France
10419,France,"Named not after the goddess of love, but the horse that Agrapart uses to plough the vines, this superb wine comes from 50-year-old vines, the clay   element in the soil giving richness, the minerality giving balance, lifting up the yellow fruit flavors with excellent acidity.",France
10420,France,"Disgorged in 2006, this wine (and it is a wine, almost more than a Champagne) is young, dry and touched with green plums, secondary flavors of toast and yeast, as well as an white flower perfume.",US
10421,France,"The 1996 vintage really brings out the minerality in a wine. This grand cru is still austere, very crisp, with some smokiness, apple-skin flavors and intense freshness. Give it another 5–6 years.",US
10422,France,"From 90-year-old vines in Le Mesnil-sur-Oger, this is a superbly ripe wine, full-bodied, concentrated with a great swathe of minerality going through. This is still young, based on the 2004 vintage, but shows every sign of developing into a beautifully toasty maturity.",France
10423,France,"The fact that this wine comes from the chalkiest of soils and is bone dry gives it considerable austerity. It is definitely mineral in taste and texture, with a touch of salt and grapefruit flavors;  very structured and tight. It needs to age.",France
10424,France,"Ripe grapefruit, green plums and other green stone fruits all show that this wine has some weight, allied with a steely interior. Still young, it fills the mouth with yeast and some toast, but more of an intense freshness.",France
10425,France,"With its highly mineral aroma, this is almost like smelling chalk. It's an austere wine, with high acidity, crystal clear on the palate, full of grapefruit flavors and flint texture. Age this wine at least 4 years.",France
10426,France,"Wood maturation gives this wine roundness, despite its dryness. At the moment, it is too young, very vigorous, and touched by caramel. The feeling is of a weighty, structured wine, even though the aftertaste is fresh.",France
10427,France,"This is part of a range which returns to origins, with wood fermentation for the wines. Perfumed, green initially and then showing flavors of lychees and earthiness, this has some oak toast, but more of an open flavor from light (and pleasing) oxidation.",France
10428,France,"Still very young, this wine needs time to develop its intense minerality. Now it is more about grapefruit and yeast, although it is also full-bodied, a sign of the 1999 vintage. Wait five years at least.",France
10429,France,"With its yeasty aromas and fresh, crisp acidity, this is a young-tasting Champagne. There are flavors of green apples, just a hint of toast and a dry aftertaste from the low dosage.",France
10430,France,"From grand cru vines in Avize, Oger, Cramant and Oiry, this is full and intensely flavored, with very crisp apple and white pear flavors. To finish, the wine rounds out with vanilla and smooth textures.",US
10431,France,"This emblematic cuvée from Mumm (known for many years as Crémant de Cramant because it was bottled at a slightly lower pressure) is a celebration of grand cru Chardonnay in Cramant. It is a finely structured, relatively full-bodied wine, showing toast and butter flavors along with the pink grapefruit and crisp apple tastes.",France
10432,France,"Very intense, very nervy wine, living on a thin wire of grapefruit and other citrus flavors but much more about pure structure. The aftertaste shows great concentration.",France
10433,France,"This is full, perhaps heavy, but certainly with a fine, powerful character. The acidity and the green-apple texture are at one with the white-fruit flavors, which gives extra richness to the wine. Just a hint of mineral can be detected.",France
10434,France,"Toasty, floral and full-bodied, with a soft aftertaste, this has a great aromatic swathe initially, with only hints of Chardonnay minerality. The wine is delicious, with ripe white fruits and light acidity to finish.",France
10435,France,"This wine is beginning to get some age to it, but remains fresh. There is some toast, even coffee, while the aftertaste is soft and slightly candied.",France
10436,France,"The softness of the 1999 vintage is very apparent in this approachable wine. It is full, round, only just touched by minerality, white fruits and some almonds giving weight and character.",France
10437,France,"A good wine, this is a young, aromatic Chardonnay with lively white fruits bursting from the acidity.",France
10438,France,"More toast than fruit even at this young stage, this is a ripe wine, showing big woody, toasty flavors that leave freshness behind. There are flavors of cream, caramel and wood here. Acidity appears on the finish.",France
10439,France,"This is a blend from seven of Pascal Agrapart's less important vineyards. It tastes as young as many of the vines are crisp with some citrus and fennel, but there is some softness. Not for aging.",France
10440,France,"The wine is currently closed up, not offering huge flavors. So it is a question of feeling the richness, the steely edge and the yellow fruits. It is certainly very dense, needing several years' aging, finishing with vanilla creaminess.",France
10441,France,"The broad character of Bougros is evident here in this rich and creamy wine. Delicious pear and sweet grapefruit flavors combine easily with a delicate touch of wood, leaving a fine, juicy acidity.",France
10442,France,"Great swathes of yellow fruits here, a wine that has weight, richness and delicious texture. Final spice shows through from the wood.",France
10443,France,"A rich and soft style of wine, carrying a fine texture. The feel is ripe, important, with a certain serious edge, showing great yellow and white fruits. Power, but with a soft side.",France
10444,France,"Caramel and vanilla aromas, the palate rounded, poised, with pear and green plum flavors, along with lively acidity, filled out with toast.",US
10445,France,"A beautifully rounded wine, textured white fruits and fresh acidity well integrated into a rich structure. Hints of wood underline the yellow fruits and crisp, citrus, final acidity.",France
10446,France,"From what is always the Grand Cru that develops most quickly, this is a gorgeous, already very drinkable, ripe wine, certainly fresh. Maybe there is a more mineral character than usual, allied to higher acidity.",France

10506,France,"The impact of 50-year old vines is seen in the concentrated fruit, ripe and full,  in this wine.

10509,France,"All the fat fruit of Meursault was at its best in 2005, and even Chanson's use of high toast wood for aging the whites cannot hide it. Pineapple and peach flavors go with sweet yellow plums, juicy red apple acidity, and an exotic ginger and nutmeg spice that add complexity.",France
10510,France,"Thirteen years on, this is still not remotely mature. It is a major wine, with its still-tight, vibrant acidity and wonderful piercing grapefruit flavors. The acidity of the vintage is all there, but the strength of this Champagne is that the acidity is finely balanced with minerality and fruit.",France
10511,France,"Bone dry, but soft, this is a complete, rounded Champagne. It has plenty of the Chardonnay mineral character, with fine citrus zest and tight acidity. It is nowhere near mature, so keep for another two years. Impressive.",France
10512,France,"The aroma says wood, and that's what the taste confirms. To go with the wood, there is rounded apricot and peach-flavored fruit, open and rich. The wine has a youthful taut edge, finishing with the greatest acidity.",France
10513,France,"Crisp, certainly, but with a good structure of red apple skins, with kiwi and white peach flavors. The wine is full in the mouth, needing several months to settle down and calm the acidity that is covering the honey and toast flavors.",France

10516,France,"Weight and richness here, with attractive acidity, but also a ripe, creamy texture. The wine has some tight tannins, but is much more to do with opulent peaches and cream.",France
10517,France,"Part of the range of negociant wines under the worldwide Xavier Flouret range, this Chablis is earthy, rustic, a soft but underwhelming wine, missing the proper bite of the region's wines. Imported by Cognac One, LLC.",US
10518,France,"White and tropical fruits dominate this powerful wine. It has earthiness, an edge of rusticity that comes from its youth. Persistent toast and spice give richness as well as some structure, followed by green plum juice and fresh, crisp white currants.",France
10519,France,"With its fresh, bright fruit, touched by minerality and flintiness, this is a delicious but relatively lightweight Chablis. The fruit is pure, clean, tightly crisp, with just a more exotic hint of pineapples.",France
10520,France,"There is enticing new wood here, a wine that shows richness to boost the ripe, creamy apple and pear fruits. It has a generous character, to contrast with its core of steely acidity. The finish is more earthy, suggesting the wine still needs time in the bottle.",France
10521,France,"This is a ripe wine, structured with toast, ripe peach, spicy apricot and an attractive citrus juice character. The wine opens warmly in the mouth, but then finishes more crisply, lifted by its acidity.",France
10522,France,"A glorious outpouring of beautifully crafted Chardonnay, opulent but tightly mineral. The ripe apple and pear character has a delicate, elegant squeeze of lime, while the whole wine is underpinned by wood. No doubt for long-term aging.",France
10523,France,"From arguably the finest white wine vineyard in Burgundy, this is a powerful wine that shows great weight, but balances that with intense, elegant structure, style and freshness. The flavors are endless and complex, richness combining with the lively character of the vintage. Age for many years.",France

10525,France,"From a parcel within the Chevalier-Montrachet vineyard, this is beautifully balanced, but a wine with considerable potential. It is rich, but thrust through with a sword of steel, giving acidity that offers a succulent counterpoint to the yellow fruits. The wood is becoming well integrated, offering further richness. For long-term aging.",France
10526,France,"From the largest of the Chablis Grand Cru, this wine shows a lively fruit character but also a powerful, taut mineral streak that comes through to dominate. There is no doubt this needs aging, with its steely edge and vivid acidity.",France
10527,France,"From a parcel that used to belong to the Hospices in Chablis until purchased by the Moreau family. It is a beautifully fashioned wine, its steely character rounded out with delicious ripe fruits, green apples, pear skin and kiwi fruit. Impressive and for aging.",France
10528,France,"A very steely of wine, crisp, with a tight, knife-edge structure that needs more time to round out. At the moment, fresh and crisp apples dominate, with flavors of green apple skins.",France
10529,France,"A soft, rounded wine, with spice and toast and a cushion of plump yellow fruit. Almonds and mandarin oranges fit well together with the fine acidity.",France
10530,France,"This is on the weighty side of Chablis, giving a wine that is more Burgundy proper in its richness. That said, there is a good citric element, but the ripeness is more important, underlined by toast.",France
10531,France,"Straddling richness and beautiful liveliness, this is going to be an impressive wine. It does need aging. At this stage, the wood is a big element, but then the bright white fruits—pears, white currants along with tangerines—will move center stage. Keep at least six years, almost certainly more.",France
10532,France,"The flagship wine from Bichot's Long-Depaquit estate is, as usual, impressive. It has richness, balance, full white fruits with just a hint of steeliness. Powered by a citrus acidity, it looks likely to age well over several years.",France
10533,France,"A ripe, bold and impressive wine, showing yellow peaches and pineapple flavors to go with its tight core of minerality. There is a touch of wood, but the main thrust is for broad fruit, open and welcoming.",France
10534,France,"A bright, steely wine with great concentration and a tight, mineral character. This is impressive Grand Cru Chablis for the long term, based for the moment on lime, almonds and green plums, but itching to broaden out.",France
10535,France,"Big and weighty, the wood very dominant, a wine with considerable potential. It feels important, seriously structured, edging on austere, but promising a much broader character after several years.",France
10536,France,"Tight and still young, a wine that brings out the intense acidity of the vintage, hiding its power and potential at the moment. But both are there, offering a concentrated wine that will develop slowly as befits its Grand Cru status.",US
10537,France,"Still tasting young, with its lemon and lime flavors dominant, this is going to be a serious, mineral-driven wine. It has plenty of fruit, but it is caged in a firm, tight texture of green fruits. Obviously it needs aging.",France
10538,France,"There is definite gravitas in this big wine. It has the proper power of a Corton-Charlemagne and is a rich and concentrated wine that shows big fruits, a fine cut of acidity and layered wood. A wine for the long term.",France
10539,France,"A firm, tight wine, still young, still not showing all the roundness and weight that is potentially there. This is a wine that needs decanting, offering some good aging potential.",US

10541,France,"A wine that is soft, rounded, ready to drink. It is without concentration or great acidity, but the white and light green fruits are delicious, giving an open character that is framed by toasty flavors and some spice.",France
10542,France,"Light wine, showing some citrus along with green fruit skin structure, this is balanced and crisp. The fruits take a while to open out, then give a rounded, soft palate, leaving a green apple and toast finish.",France
10543,France,"The wood aging gives this wine a smooth, velvet texture, the toast lying easily over the fresh fruit that is hallmark of Renaud wines. It is finely balanced, a lively wine that has been rounded out well by the wood.",France
10544,France,"Nutty, toasty aromas open a wine that has yellow fruits, strong ripe peach flavors, some green plum acidity. The texture brings out the toast, flavored with toffee, the aftertaste full of creamy acidity.",France
10545,France,"A big, burly Chablis, beautifully ripe, exhibiting powerful fruits overlaying a core of citrus and apple skin texture. The wine is open, rich, with an enticing juicy character, finished with bright, ripe acidity.",France
10546,France,"Still young, of course, but already the wine is showing great fruits, smoothed by wood, offering style and sophistication. As it opens up, the flavors of pears and sweet apples join the toast and the ripeness. This is on the path to greatness; give it 5–6 years and more.",France
10547,France,"Rich, full, powerful Chardonnay, with yellow fruits balanced with lemon, green apple and white currants. The structure, though, pushes the wine into a mineral direction, adding tightness and toast to the ebullient fruit. Age for 4–5 years and more.",France
10548,France,"A wine in two parts. It opens soft, with attractive green and white fruits. Then a tight, steely grip shows through, offering aging as well as a taut mineral character. Give the wine 4–5 years.",France
10549,France,"Still young, this powerful wine has intense steely minerality to go with its almost stark green fruits. It has a great texture, edged with acidity, and a light toast character. A wine for aging.",France
10550,France,"A finely balanced wine, with the acidity a pure streak through the white pear and lime flavors. The wine is rich, the wood so carefully judged with the beautiful fruit.",France
10551,France,"Plenty of ripe fruit and big texture on this intense wine, which hasn't shown half its potential yet. The pear and white peach fruits are edged with minerality and a closed-in texture. The wood gives an unfortunate burnt edge that needs to soften out. Age for at least five years.",France
10552,France,"There is a fine steely, mineral character to the wine that parallels the ripe yellow fruit, toast and quince jelly flavors. The ensemble is rich, but maintains the true cool-climate character of Chablis.",France
10553,France,"Great acidity, green fruits, delicious citrus touches: all the elements of fresh, crisp, lively Chablis are here, the core of minerality giving a great structure.",France
10554,France,"Pure apple and cream aromas, spiked with pear skin spice. As the palate opens out, it reveals tight fruit skin tannins, green plums and Granny Smith apples, finishing creamy but very fresh.",France
10555,France,"A beautifully balanced wine, its acidity blending easily with the fresh fruits, toast and rich texture. There is a high mineral content, but this fits well into the white fruits, lime zest and final freshness.",France
10556,France,"Big and bold, this lives up to the reputation of richer Meursault. Yet crispness, a core of tight structure, toast and fresh fruits are always present. The play between the characters is delicious and likely to allow the wine to age over several years.",France
10557,France,"Fine ripe fruit shows on this full-flavored wine, but there is as much of the vanilla, toast and spice character as there is of the peach note. The texture, though, is all fruit, tight apple skins with final fresh acidity.",France
10558,France,"A broad, fat wine, showing soft white fruits and a definite amount of toast. Only towards the end does juicy acidity show through. It feels not yet fully integrated, so hold off a year.",France
10559,France,"Fèvre's basic Chablis still shows the quality of this producer, with its finely textured, fully ripe fruit layered with a strong citrus character. There is some toastiness, which adds complexity but certainly doesn't dominate the green plum fruit flavors and lively acidity.",France
10560,France,"A light, crisp, fresh wine, with attractive lemon grass and orange zest flavors. It is juicy, the green fruits full of intensity. There is good minerality as well, underlined by toast from wood aging.",France
10561,France,"Starting with green acidity, this wine opens up well to give cool lemon and mineral flavors. These are followed by a creamy texture that softens the acidity, giving a ripe, full finish.",France
10562,France,"Fèvre's domaine Chablis is a classic of its kind—fresh, steely, with a strong mineral content to go with the bright green apple flavors. Think simply cooked fish and you'd be just right.",France
10563,France,"There is really ripe fruit here, a warm fruit salad and creamy series of flavors. Peaches and toast dominate, but freshened by apple. The acidity comes through but gently, leaving a sweet, soft aftertaste.",France
10564,France,"A warm, earthy, rustic style, richly fruity with peaches and sweet juiced fruits. There is good balance of wood, toast, nutmeg and sweet spice. The finale draws a fine line in elegance.",France
10565,France,"The style is full in the mouth, showing vanilla as well as soft peach fruits. Finishing richly, this is not a Grand Cru for aging, but it does wear its ripe fruit easily with a good burst of steely acidity.",France
10566,France,"The aromas are earthy, rich in moist soil. The palate is just as rich, a full, opulent wine powered with yellow fruits and a light touch of spice.",France
10567,France,"A wine that offers many personalities, from serious complexity to broad, smiling, ripe fruits. Pineapple, peaches, almonds and acidity come together in a texture that is still integrating. Give the wine another two years at least.",US
10568,France,"This wine combines both the richness of 2005 with the minerality of the terroir, a balance that works well. It is certainly full but never overblown, restrained by a streak of steel and by the green apple flavors.",France
10569,France,"Appropriately big and burly, full of ripe fruit, rather soft as well as rich. With its yellow fruits, layers of white currants and a powerful wood element, this is a wine that is still knitting together. There is potential here, especially from the underlying acidity. Give it 4–5 years.",France
10570,France,"Full and rounded, this is typical of the richness you expect from this Grand Cru. It has a vanilla edge of wood, but the fruit is so bountiful that you only jsut ntoice it. Almost tropical in its richness, this is a delicious wine that will be best to drink after five years of cellaring.",France
10571,France,"A citrus-dominated wine, lime and lemon giving a crisp intensity. There is a somewhat bitter toast element, but the acidity, the fresh fruits and the soft structure act as a counter-balance. Give it six months to a year. Screwcap.",France
10572,France,"A toasty, smoky wine, with freshening acidity, crisp green and white fruits and an attractive edge of toasty oak. The wine is lively, fresh, delicious, very poised and vibrant.",US
10573,France,"A warm, toasty wine, maybe with too much wood at the moment, but with proper plump, ripe peach flavors and an edge of apple-skin acidity. The wine needs aging —give it 4–5 years.",France
10574,France,"The wine has some of the steely, mineral character of Chablis, while also offering richer toast flavors. It is crisp, a delicious green edge to it, while the structure promises a few years development.",France
10575,France,"A bold, rich wine with yellow fruits, toast and spice. At the same time, there is a crisp, tight edge of acidity and minerality that gives a sense of the cool character of the chalk soil of Chablis. A fine wine, lively, ripe, but totally fresh.",France
10576,France,"A big-hearted wine, packed with forward fruits, maybe dominated by the wood at this stage, but likely to become more rich as it ages. The flavors are bold, white fruits combining with lime zest acidity. For aging over the next three years.",France

10580,France,"Sumptuous and creamy, this is a deliciously ripe wine. It balances fresh white fruits against almonds and a rounded structure. Perhaps the acidity is lost in all the richness, but it's a wine to relish now.",France
10581,France,"An apple-fresh wine with attractive crisp acidity. The texture is of green apple skins followed by a firm, tight mouthfeel. The wine has a fine mineral edge, with a taut finish.",France
10582,France,"Rich and powerful, this is a spicy wine flavored with caramel and apricot. There is a layer of high toast that is out of balance with the fruit, and needs time to calm down. Wait 6–9 months.",France
10583,France,"A young wine, with crisp apple and grapefruit salad freshness. It is bright, glowing with vibrant fruit and a light touch of toast.",France
10584,France,"A wine that starts with ripe citrus flavors, then moves easily into soft richness as the spicy wood and sweet peach flavors come through strongly. The wood is dominant, but not excessive. Full, ripe and still young.",France
10585,France,"A delicious wine that moves easily between rich, wood-aged Chardonnay and a tight mineral structure. It is ripe, with apricot flavors interspersing with pears and some orange zest. While it is ready to drink, another few months will bring out even more richness.",France
10586,France,"Good ripe and rich wine that shows some of the opulence of Meursault. It has a good balance between toast and broad yellow and white fruit flavors. With acidity an extra component, the wine is attractively complete.",France

10590,France,"Powerful wine, structured with apple skin tannins, layers of ripe, spicy toast and a taut, mineral character. There is something of the Meursault richness here, in the full white fruit flavors, but this is also a wine that needs to age.",France
10591,France,"Grapefruit, toast and white peach aromas give this wine a great start. It is not powerful but is deliciously balanced with fresh green plum and pink grapefruit flavors rounded out with just the perfect amount of wood. Drink 2010.",France
10592,France,"An intensely perfumed wine that smells of a candy shop. It has tight acidity, but that is lost in the welter of white fruit flavors, allied with sweet wood. It seems at first too sweet, but then toast and acidity come in to give the wine an edgy finale.",France
10593,France,"The curse of Chanson's high toast for whites hits this wine. It is a shame, because once through the wood, the fruit is fresh and rounded, crispened but also given ripe white pear flavors.",France
10594,France,"A soft wine, but with a crisp, creamy, fresh character underneath the surface. There are pear and citrus flavors, with an adjustment of toast. The soft theme continues on the light and fresh finish.",France
10595,France,"Ripe and soft, perfumed and floral, this is pure fruit, a pear- and peach-flavored wine with a hint of toast and almonds. It is clean as a mountain stream, so fresh, but with some weight. And just look at the alcohol—11.5% That'll save your falling off your bar stool. Screwcap.",France
10596,France,"Perfectly round Chardonnay, not an edge or angle in sight. The wine is soft, juicy, broad, but never going over the top, keeping freshness and green fruits in play as a counterweight.",US
10597,France,"A broad wine, its ripe flavors fashioned with yellow fruits, toast, vanilla and an opulent texture. This is rich, open and packed with full-in-the-mouth flavors. Ready to drink.",France
10598,France,"Soft, ripe and balanced, this is already a delicious wine. The grapefruit edge to the fruit gives it considerable freshness, but there are also flavors of white fruits, just leavened by toast. To finish, the acidity just bounces out of the glass.",France
10599,France,"The vintage in Chablis seems to bring out both richness and minerality. That's certainly the combination here. The wine is full, with green plum juice followed by yellow peaches. At the core, though, is a tense, tight streak that comes from the chalk soil of the region, giving a firm structure.",France
10600,France,"Typically Meursault with its fat fruit and texture, this is a wine that doesn't yet quite integrate. The problem is the excessive wood, which dominates the fruit, and gives tense acidity to the wine. It leaves intense spiciness, burnt toast flavors and a bitter, grapefruit flavor on the finish. Maybe in a few years.",France
10601,France,"A fine, fruity but structured wine. It brings together many attractive elements of crisp fruits, ripe peaches, toast and a definite tight structure for aging. Keep for 2–3 years.",France
10602,France,"A lively, fresh wine that gives a steely, mineral edge to the ripe fruits and the crisp acidity. The wine fills the mouth, a bold streak of apple skin structure boosting the fresh fruits.",France
10603,France,"A ripe, rounded wine, with just some wood. It is soft, with flavors of apricots followed by a fresh acidity and a final waft of tropical fruits and spice.",France
10604,France,"Full and ripe, certainly as befits Meursault from a great year, but this wine also has deliciously crisp acidity which adds an element of minerality, of poise, to the smooth toast and cream texture. An enticing, structured wine.",France
10605,France,"Rounded, soft and spicy, this is a lively wine; not complex, just enjoyable. Lemon and white pear flavors are dominant, while the acidity is easy, fresh and textured by green apples.",US
10606,France,"The wood flavors smooth out this ripe green plum and apple wine, giving toast and caramel alongside the fruit. It has some crispness, but the main texture is round and soft.",France
10607,France,"A fresh wine, all citrus and green plums, and rounded out with wood. This is an immediately attractive, thirst-quenching wine, with just a touch of sophistication.",France
10608,France,"A light, refreshing sparkler with just a hint of toastiness, Ehrhart's Cuvée Prestige features hints of lemon and lime and a fresh, citrusy finish.",France
10609,France,"An opulent style, very Meursault, the weight coming from the wood and the packed white fruit flavors. The wine is smooth, generous, a big ripe mouthful of fruit. The aftertaste shows some wood.",France
10610,France,"Smooth and rich, a wine that seems soft rather than focused. Hints of wood add to the attraction, while pear and lychee flavors give further ripeness. It probably needs several months, or a year, to come together.",France
10611,France,"This relishes the ripe softness of Saint-Aubin, giving a wide-open wine with weight. The contrast is with clean-lined green plums and just some spice.",France
10612,France,"Fine and fresh, this has clean fruit, a touch of caramel along with crisp white peach and creamy apple. The wine is light, soft, accessible now.",US
10613,France,"This is a wine that has lightness and freshness as dominant characters. Yes, there is fine green fruit, with a backbone structure of white currants, but the acidity, well supported by wood, is what gives the wine shape and a vivid, fresh aftertaste.",France
10614,France,"Soft and rounded, with pear juice flavors dominant. This characteristic is balanced by a crisp, fresh, dancing style that gives delicious almond and herbal flavors. For drinking now.",France
10615,France,"A rounded wine, all comfortable fruits and texture. There is a nice bite of lime juice acidity to sharpen up the gentle character, as well as some toast to add spice. An attractive, already mature wine.",France
10616,France,"A mineral wine that brings an austere character as well as fresh fruit. Apples, pears and lime zest are all there. Attractive, open and ready to drink.",France
10617,France,"Going for a mineral character, the wine has freshness and also crisp lime, pineapple and caramel flavors. Light in feel, finely textured, almost steely.",France
10618,France,"While this is a light wine, on the steely side, it has a most attractive freshness and very crisp fruitiness. It is bright, shiny, just hinting at wood and more complex flavors.",France
10619,France,"Fresh toast and citrus aromas indicate a wine that is both full-bodied and balanced. The wood is very evident at this stage, giving a firm, toasty character. There are white peaches and citrus flavors, and long-lasting, refreshing acidity to finish.",France
10620,France,"White fruits and delicious soft acidity make this wine immediately attractive. It is rich and fresh at the same time, with just a touch of apple skin structure. The name of the wine refers to the Solutré rock which towers over the vineyards.",France
10621,France,"There is a good deal of wood here, the wine tasting of toasty wood as much as the fresh white fruits. It is just on the edge of too much wood, but then the crisp acidity and rounded flavors bring the wine back into balance. It really needs aging, 3–4 years.",France
10622,France,"Light, fresh citrus aromas filled by beautiful spicy wood, with lovely crisp final character. The spice and wood add to the crisp juiciness of the wine.",France
10623,France,"This wine that offers both minerality and a fresh, creamy character. It is light, with citrus and bright pear flavors finishing as fresh and crisp as they come.",France
10624,France,"A lightweight wine, very crisp and citrusy, floating easily with attractive freshness. The fruit comes over with some good apple skin textures and a vibrant, bright aftertaste.",France
10625,France,"The wine continues the rise in quality of whites from this producer. It is refined, elegant, not powerful, but with a great balance between wood and fruit, and a long, lingering green fruit aftertaste.",France
10626,France,"A light, floating style, pierced with minerality and crisp green apple skin flavors. There is wood, but it is only just noticeable. With its structure and tense fruit, this is likely to age well: give it 5–8 years.",France
10627,France,"Deliciously fresh, this is almost delicate, certainly elegant. There is great balance here, the wood just lightly toasty over the smooth, creamy white fruit flavors. For a wine from a lesser Burgundy appellation, this is impressive.",France
10628,France,"This is a wine that is about tropical fruits, softness and ripeness. It is definitely full-bodied, needing to show its structure, but the spice, toast and yellow fruit flavors are all immediately attractive.",France
10629,France,"This is delicious white Burgundy. The fruit is lively, crisp, lemony, while the texture is rounded, just tight enough to give structure, but open enough to be relaxed. The finish offers just a hint of spice.",France
10630,France,"Impressively ripe and dense, with maple syrup and citrus characters giving a delicious, full wine. Kiwi and green plum dominate the fruit, while the concentrated underlying structure gives a soft cushion of richness.",France
10631,France,"Ripe, soft and creamy, with yellow fruits, fresh acidity and a hint of toast. The wine is full, textured with pear skins, with a strong citrus element.",France
10632,France,"A ripe, soft, nut- and pear-flavored wine, with fresh acidity. It is smooth, velvet in texture, with some apple juice freshness on the finish.",France
10633,France,"Broad, ripe, full in the mouth, packed with soft white fruits and an open structure. There is some wood, the vanilla melding easily into the fruit. For drinking now.",France
10634,France,"Full-bodied, relatively simple wine. It has fresh acidity, flavors of white stone fruits and almonds and an attractive citrus lilt. Ready for drinking.",France
10635,France,"A soft, open wine, giving wood and yellow fruit flavors followed by light acidity. The initial effect is somewhat dilute, but the wine does show more fruit character as it opens up.",France
10636,France,"From a small appellation in the north of the Mâconnais, producing reds as well as whites, this is initially a mineral, citric wine, which broadens out with toast, fresh acidity and a good weight, with lychee and yellow fruits.",France
10637,France,"Fine ripe fruit, with citrus acidity and ripe, soft opulent yellow fruits. The acidity and wood give the wine structure, but the main parts of this wine are its richness and softness.",France
10638,France,"Like many of Denis Pommier's wines, this comes from old vines, and the concentration is testament to that. The texture is rich, touched by honeyed wood, with peaches in syrup ripeness. As a contrast, there is also a fresh, red apple acidity, which gives a lift to the aftertaste.",France
10639,France,"This tense, crisp wine is all green fruit, very straight, very fresh. Apple, pink grapefruit and almonds come together in a wine that has no complexity, but offers plenty of pleasure.",France
10640,France,"On the tart side, emphasizing grapefruit rather than riper citrus and with a definite texture of very green apple skins. Initially this is too crisp for its own good, but then with seafood, it works well. Screwcap.",France
10641,France,"A wide-open, creamy wine, with flavors of ripe apples. It is round, generous, full-bodied, only just touched by minerality and edged with wood. Drink over the next 2–3 years.",France
10642,France,"There is a fine touch of minerality here, giving an edge to a wine that is soft, full of crisp lemon and pear flavors, followed by a bright line of acidity. For drinking now.",US
10643,France,"The little touch of wood aging (three months) is just enough to round out the Chardonnay. At the same time, it does show freshness and apple flavors, with an attractive floral character. It is soft and finally ripe.",France
10644,France,"Initially very mineral, this wine opens up to soft, creamy toast and vanilla flavors. The acidity is crisp but sweet, hinting at yellow fruits and then showing off pears. The finish is all about freshness.",France
10645,France,"Initially, this appears gentle and creamy; only later does acidity and green pear skin structure come in. Full and plump, with soft white fruits, the wood is prominent at this stage.",France
10646,France,"For a Petit-Chablis, this has plenty of firm, tight structure. While the fruit is light, it is based on a texture of sweet caramel and plums, freshened with acidity. The finish is rich and soft.",France
10647,France,"Tight green apple and citrus acidity dominates this wine. It is very crisp, at this stage too crisp, and the structure is on the lean side. It certainly reflects the cool growing conditions of 2007.",France
10648,France,"Light and crisp, this is a fresh style of wine without much weight. There are a toast element from wood, some green berry structure, flavors of white currants, and tight acidity. The finish shows citrus and high toast. Screwcap.",France
10649,France,"The fabled Salon's latest release is much riper and softer than the great steely 1996 vintage. This suggests it is likely to be ready to drink soon. In the meantime, the acidity is supremely fresh, with grapefruit edges and green apple flavors. And then there is minerality and a tight, structured aftertaste as a reminder that this great Champagne is always going to be more than its fruit.",France
10650,France,"The purity of this wine is impressive. It has a straight line of mineral, flint and grapefruit running through it. Around this, there are layers of fresh apples, lime zest and a tight, taut structure. The one downside to what is a fine wine is that it, like many Roederer vintages, is too young. Give it 4–5 years.",France
10651,France,"Possibly the most famous Blanc de Blancs, this continues to be a yardstick. The style almost floats, a layer of bubbles that rests gently in the mouth, releasing great flavors of very crisp fruits and a texture that hovers between green apples and minerality. This is a classic.",France
10652,France,"Tasting light, almost dilute, this is a pleasant wine with white fruit flavors and a light textured acidity. The flavors come slowly and the final acidity is only fleeting.",France
10653,France,"A ripe wine, balanced with a crisp edge. The structure is rounded, full of green plums, quince, given liveliness with a lime zest acidity. There is a light wood touch that shows through at the end.",France
10654,France,"A wine that is all about crispness, structure and bright fruits. The creamy texture from lees aging gives a rounder dimension, but the main thrust here is minerality coupled with delicious acidity.",France
10655,France,"Caramel wood aromas, with smooth fruit. The wine is rich, warm, with the pure white and yellow fruit flavors showing well. It is crisp, but also rich.",France
10656,France,"There is plenty of wood here, quite a dominant feature. The fruit comes behind, showing bright ripe white fruits and a hint of apricot. The wood spice, though, has the last word.",France
10657,France,"An attractively balanced wine, full of ripe, warm fruit, but still keeping the acidity as a counterweight to the rich tropical and white fruit flavors. The wood shows, but the fruit powers through to give richness and some freshness.",France
10658,France,"Heavy and glowering, this wine is powered with weight. The fruit is an afterthought, the white currants, green plums and acidity creeping in after all the density of structure has softened. Wood to finish.",France
10659,France,"A wine with lightness and crisp, clear fruit. The texture is rounded, but it is dominated by citrus and white currants, finished with green apples. Drink now.",France
10660,France,"Fresh, light, creamy Chardonnay, just a touch of vanilla with crisp, clean green fruits. There is an attractive touch of spice to round the wine off.",US
10661,France,"This was a good year in Chablis, a breath of freshness after the impressive, powerful 2005, but a vintage that still has weight and intensity. This Chablis shows all that, with an extra dimension of spice, nuts and a tight apple-skin structure leading to a fresh finish.",US
10662,France,"Following an unfortunate Chanson white wine style, this wine is totally dominated by new, high toast wood. It shows freshness, but the acidity comes from the wood, leaving the structured fruit way behind.",France
10663,France,"Light, creamy Chardonnay, with vivid lemon and green plum flavors. Fresh and lightly yeasty, its fruit is right up front, and with the vanilla from wood aging far in the background. Drink now.",France
10664,France,"Rich, toasty, mature, this important Champagne is all those things. It's certainly mature for a 1998 vintage, which means it would be delicious to drink now. But the ripeness, allied to the serious acidity and wood structure, do suggest that it's likely to age more.",France
10665,France,"Jacquesson is proud possessor of top quality grand cru vineyards in Avize. This vintage is subtle, a wine that takes a while to show all its richness, balanced with elegance. The fruit is ripe pear, peach and orange zest. It has a great streak of minerality. Worth aging.",France
10666,France,"Light, fresh, soft and already very drinkable. The initial taste is dominated by citrus, and then it rounds out, adding toast, green fruits and a definite sophistication for a simple white Burgundy.",France
10667,France,"Crisp, green and steely, this is classic Chablis, all about pure green fruits and minerality, only lightly layered with wood. It is vibrant and fresh, with the acidity adding a mouthwatering lightness.",France
10668,France,"This wine runs the gamut of crisp, mineral flavors. It is tight, driven by green flavors and acidity, with just a touch of vanilla. As befits a Petit Chablis, there is lightness rather than weight, but it makes a delicious aperitif style of wine.",France
10669,France,"A remarkable wine that manages effortlessly to bring together ripe apricot and sweet pear flavors with a balanced maturity that is so delicious. It has power and richness, but there is also minerality and a hint of a chalky texture. This 1999 needs less aging than previous vintages and can be drunk now.",France
10670,France,"A rich, rounded Champagne, ripe and fruity without being simplistic. The complexity comes from the toast, the vanilla and the spicy edge combining with the quince, pear and white peach flavors. The acidity is finely balanced. Expect to age this for 5–7 years.",France
10671,France,"Aromas of yellow flowers and cedar-plank-grilled pears follow through to the palate alongside notes of fresh peach slices and lime. Though quite round in the mouth, the finish is long and evolving, transitioning from ripe fruit to a clean, assertive acidity.",France
10672,France,"A soft wine that hints at the richness of Meursault, with caramel flavors giving weight, and a distinct citrus and apple character giving freshness. For early drinking.",France
10673,France,Here's an 100% unoaked Chard that offers ripe tropical notes of mango and pineapple alongside flavors of rich red apple and canteloupe in the round mouth. Softly prickling acidity leads nicely into the fruity finish.,France
10674,France,"An attractive, fresh Chablis, with flavors of juicy currants, spice and lime juice. It is crisp and shows full final fruit and acidity.",France
10675,France,"A creamy, vanilla- and ripe fruit-flavored wine. Apricot and melon fruit flavors dominate, with new wood and a delicate layer of crisp, clean acidity. Drink now.",France
10676,France,"Intense wood aromas are coupled with white fruits. This has smoothed out the fruit, just hinting at peaches, and is more about the toast and spice. The aftertaste is full.",France
10677,France,"A toasty, oaky wine, with smoky aromas and flavors that mask the white fruit flavors and acidity. Hopefully all this high toast will burn off. Hold for 2–3 years.",US
10678,France,"With extra aging on the lees, this creamy wine shows delicious green apple and pink grapefruit flavors and a layer of yeasty ripeness. It's certainly crisp at the same time, but the extra age rounds out the concentrated fruitiness.",France
10679,France,"A very soft, ripe and open wine that lacks structure. The best aspects are the finely judged wood element and the light acidity that floats at the end.",France
10680,France,"Soft and open, a little unfocused but a pleasantly ripe Chardonnay. The white fruit and acidity are well in balance in a wine that is perfectly ready to drink.",France
10681,France,"Ripe, creamy wine with a good toast element. It is smooth, elegant, the flavors showing almonds, vanilla, baked apple and pear enlivened by fresh acidity. Attractive, ready to drink.",France
10682,France,"Freshness is the hallmark of this attractively crisp, apple-flavored wine. The lightness of texture manages to retain some good green plum skin, apricot and lively acidity. The finish is pure, clean, slightly honeyed.",France
10683,France,"This soft wine focuses on white fruits, pears and a creamy texture. The acidity is there, with a touch of minerality, but with its simple, easy flavors, this makes a great aperitif.",France
10684,France,"Great green apples and white fruits dominate this intense, mineral wine. There is some power, but the wine also floats easily over its structure, enhanced by the appetizing aftertaste. This is for food.",France
10685,France,"There is an edge of minerality, a tight texture. But that lies on a wine that has some weight and richness, white fruits giving a broad swathe of ripeness, just brought into line by the taut acidity.",France
10686,France,"This value-priced Chard offers a medium-intense bouquet of orange rind, Granny Smith apple and white peach pit followed by a round mouth with accents of apple skins and buttercup. Balanced with a solid finish and low alcohol.",France
10687,France,"Soft Chardonnay, nicely balanced between ripe white fruits and some toast. It is an open, generous wine, enjoyable and ready to drink.",France
10688,France,"You can definitely detect the wood on this wine, but it is finely integrated with the creamy apricot and white fruit flavors. Acidity fits well into this ripe, easy and soft Chardonnay.",France
10689,France,"A rich, creamy, toast- and caramel- flavored wine. There are impressive layers of complexity here from the apples and cream taste to the ripe acidity. Swathes of perfumed grapefruit and green fruits waft over this rich wine.",France
10690,France,"Making a vintage only from Chardonnay, the Gimmonet family is able to bring out the best of the year. This wine retains its crispness, minerality, almost chalky texture and fresh pear flavors. Its freshness promises aging potential.",France
10691,France,"Fresh apples, grapefruit and sweeter apricots all hang together well in this elegant Chardonnay. It's an apéritif style, its crispness giving a light character, the fruit floating over the acidity. There are lively green fruit flavors to finish.",France
10692,France,"A soft, firm wine with a nice touch of citrus. The character is fresh, light, with a fine burst of final acidity to mark an easy, bright wine.",US
10693,France,"A crisp, citrusy wine that is light, just touched by wood, but much more in the way of acidity and freshness. Green plum flavors give some extra flesh to this vibrant wine.",France
10694,France,"Soft, rather unfocused wine, its fruit slow to show. There are flavors of apple juice, a tight steely edge, but the wine finishes simply.",France
10695,France,"Green plums, cinnamon and freshness all come together in this attractive, ready-to-drink white. Toast and white fruits all bring extra pleasure to the mix.",France
10696,France,"A fresh, lightweight Chardonnay, hinting at citrus and almonds. There is a taut, tannic edge to the yellow fruits, the acidity turning to a firm texture. Final acidity is fresh and crisp.",France
10697,France,"Delicious soft, pure pear juice and quince flavors, touched by honey, still fresh and crisp, with lively acidity. An apéritif wine.",France
10698,France,"Here's a rich and smoky Chard with nice aromas and flavors of wood-grilled red apples with a caramel drizzle, peach pit and Key lime citrus. Solidly structured with good heft, a long finish and prominent acidity that keeps the wine from going over the edge and being too flabby. Drink now.",France
10699,France,"A very pretty, well-balanced Chard from South of France powerhouse Gérard Bertrand. Baked peaches, pretty yellow florals and a touch of honeysuckle integrate seamlessly in the creamy mouth. The finish shows notes of sweet citrus, leaving a clean and refreshing impression on the palate.",France
10700,France,"A wine that is easygoing, with soft fruits and flavors of pears. But there is no intensity to this pleasantly fresh wine, only hints of wood and mineral. The aftertaste has light acidity.",France
10701,France,"Starts off with a faint chemical odor that blows off quickly, allowing the more appealing notes of small white flowers, pear and toasted hazlenut to come through. Medium weight in the mouth with a solid, roasty finish. A great choice for barbecue or grilled chicken.",France
10702,France,"A moderate-weight, citrus-infused Chard with soft green apple and dandelion floral accents. A crisp, clean finish and medium acidity makes this an excellent choice for warm weather sipping.",France
10703,France,"Crisp, clean and clear Chardonnay, soft and attractive, the fruit on the citrus side, but with some red apple skin juice to make it richer.",France
10704,France,"The wine has aromas of pears. There is plenty of fruit here, but the freshness is missing, giving a southern, warm feel.",France
10705,France,"Simple, attractive, light Chardonnay. Green fruits and pear juice layer with acidity and a soft texture. With its lively, crisp finish, the wine is ready to drink.",France
10706,France,"Not overdone or overripe, here's a rich Chard that boasts fresh peach and red apple notes with notes of tropical fruit acidity. Clean and solid with a medium mouthfeel; an easy-drinking choice that's perfect for company.",France
10707,France,"Big and powerful, this is the grandest of the grand crus. It has both  a dense structure and overwhelming fruits. With minerality, spice and balance, this is a very complete wine. There is only a hint of the richness to come. Hold for 10 years at least.",France
10708,France,"This is the epitome of great Chablis, with minerality, initial austerity and coiled power. It is a dense, tense wine, structured with both toasty tannins and green fruits that shine out of all this concentration. Age for 7–10 years.",France
10709,France,"There is much concentration and freshness here, along with much power and intense minerality. The wine is very rich with butter, ripe fruit and layers of considerable acidity. Wait 6 years at least.",France
10710,France,"Often seen as the easiest of the grand crus because of its richness, this shows more power due to the vintage. There is some tightness to the ripe structure, with white currant, pear skin and spice flavors. Finishes with sweet acidity.",France
10711,France,"Using the old name for Bougros, this is from the steepest portion of the Bougros vineyard. The pure chalk soil gives it pronounced minerality, and it shows firm structure, with green apples, toast and a very firm, tight character. This wine definitely needs to age; give it 5–8 years.",France
10712,France,"This flagship wine is Laroche's selection from the best wines of Les Blanchots. At this stage, it is young, its aromas mineral and crisp, but its future generous richness is very evident. It will be an intensely powerful expression of Chardonnay, touched by wood, and leaving great concentration. Screwcap.",France
10713,France,"Elegance is the key to this wine. The fruit, acidity and wood are all finely in balance, leading to a tight structure of green fruits and oak, balanced by great freshness. It is a fine, tight wine, but potentially rich.",France
10714,France,"Initially this is closed up, then the wood and the superbly rich fruit assert themselves, unfolding into toast, lime, tropical fruits, plums and a dense, fresh acidity. It is still coming together, working up to being a superb wine. Give it 10 years.",France
10715,France,"Touched by wood, this wine is more about the huge, rich fruit flavors; the yellow peaches and mangoes are balanced with a defined citrus element. Rich, but given structure from the crisp grapefruit flesh and red apples.",France
10716,France,"An attractive Mâcon, with some rich character, forward white fruits and a delicious apéritif style of freshness and acidity.",France
10717,France,"A very warm, generous, ripe wine, this comes from the most precocious of the grand cru vineyards. It is packed with yellow fruits, rich and open. This is opulence in a glass, boosted by toast and spice.",France
10718,France,"A concentrated, hugely rich wine with lively caramel and toast aromas, followed by ripe fruits. It is generous and open, with apricots and nectarines giving richness, while kiwi gives the green, crisp character. The aftertaste is all minerality. Screwcap.",France

10720,France,"Structured and tight, this is a powerful wine, dominated by wood aromas and white fruit, with spice, wood and green herb flavors. There's a smokiness that comes from the soil, and to finish, very pure green fruits.",France
10721,France,"This is pure mineral, chalk and lean austerity initially, but opens up with apples,  lime and green plums. It is intense, concentrated and structured; needs time. Wait 4–5 years.",France
10722,France,"The 18 acres of Château de Grenouilles are a monopoly of the La Chablisienne cooperative. A huge, ripe wine, very fruity, with yellow peaches. The richness is balanced with a steely core of minerality. Lively acidity finishes this impressive wine.",France
10723,France,"This is an elegant, refined style of wine, with all the elements in balance. There is wood, green and white fruits, fresh acidity and repressed power. This is a Chablis style that needs aging—give it at least 5 years.",France
10724,France,"This is so closed up at the moment, all mineral and steel, that it is hard to feel the ripeness of the tropical fruit. As this develops, it will flesh out the yellow fruits, balancing the acidity. The aftertaste is already thirst quenching.",France
10725,France,"This tight, steely wine is austere initially, but opens up to show concentrated richness, with flavors of white currants, vivid green fruits and crisp, intense acidity. Obviously a wine that needs age—4 years at least.",France
10726,France,"Very firm, this is a structured, relatively austere wine, with lots of minerality and tightness. The green fruits are  pierced with acidity, but also very fresh. A wine that needs time, give this at least 5–6 years. Screwcap.",France
10727,France,"Intensity is the keyword here: the butter, toast and ripe yellow fruits are both ripe and powerful. There's some spice, balanced with acidity, finishing so fresh, young and crisp.",France
10728,France,"Open, generous and relatively opulent, showing all the richness of 2005, along with peaches, apricots and tropical fruits. It's round from start to finish, a luscious Chardonnay. Just some crispness at the end.",France
10729,France,"This wine shows that top Chablis should be aged. This is like tasting the barebones of the wine without the flesh that is still very hidden. There is suppressed power, as well as green acidity and potential richness. Wait 5 years.",France
10730,France,"This shows how Dauvissat's wines need to age. At the moment, this is closed up, only hinting at its almost tropical richness, ripe yellow fruits and some white currants, but still kept in balance with acidity and minerality.",France
10731,France,"This is a wine that speaks of its terroir, the chalk soil coming out in a very mineral, austere character. It has elegance, class, great style of poise, showing acidity, fresh green fruits and a need to age for at least 5 years.",France
10732,France,"Lively but rich, this balances freshness, crispness and minerality with dense, delicious fruits. There are caramel and white fruit flavors, along with intense structure. This should age for 3–4 years. Screwcap.",France
10733,France,"The Loire produces a crisp style of Chardonnay, and this one emphasizes fresh lime and other citrus flavors. It has structure, a crisp core of pear skins with a floral, green finish.",France
10734,France,"Fresh Chardonnay, lightly warm but also tinged with acidity, citrus and pear flavors. Soft, creamy and friendly. Drink now.",France
10735,France,"Chitry lies just outside the Chablis appellation area, giving a wine that has some of the classic steely character but is more rounded and less focused. Pleasing Chardonnay, finishes with an attractive vanilla touch.",France
10736,France,"Pleasant, soft wine, easy to drink, its fruits round and somewhat dilute. It doesn't resonate, but is certainly fresh and crisp.",France
10737,France,"A decent Chard at an attractive price. Light intensity on the nose with suggestions of citrus and pear slices. The mouth is just as subtle, leading through to the short but clean finish.",France
10738,France,"Soft and broad, a little unfocused, the fruit showing pear juice and green apple skins. It feels light, juicy, missing concentration, and there's a caramel toast aftertaste.",US
10739,France,"Lightweight wine that seems somewhat dilute with flavors of green plums, bright acidity and a very soft texture.",France
10740,France,"With prominent biscuit notes, this crémant announces its allegiance to the elegant Champagne style. It follows through with a fine mousse and a light impression in the mouth. A few pear and earth aroams peek through on the fleeting finish. Drink up.",France
10741,France,"An interesting Chard that offers quite sweet notes of stewed peaches, orange marmalade and overripe honeydew. Big and a bit clumsy in the mouth, more vibrancy and freshness is needed to keep things in better balance. However, if you like 'em sweeter, this one's for you.",France
10742,France,"Surprisingly open for a 2005, this shows wood through its intense green fruit. It is rounded, generous, almost opulent with tropical fruits as well as plums, and shot through with citrus. This will develop faster than other Brocard Grand Crus.",France
10743,France,"A very vibrant, lively wine, all mineral and fresh acidity. There is some austerity  as the fruit still needs to round out; but it promises to develop well, with delicious green apple and grapefruit flavors. Keep this for 3–4 years.",France
10744,France,"Steeliness exemplified in wine. This is crisp and structured, complex with its green fruits, structured acidity and touch of caramel and kiwi. It's the acidity that shows at the moment; needs 4–5 years.",France
10745,France,"Intital bright, green fruit aromas on this concentrated, intense style of wine, with some smoky flavors to complement the crisp, green freshness. It's a very complete wine, well balanced, with all of the fruits in place along with spice.",France
10746,France,"Regarded in Chablis as almost a grand cru vineyard, Vaulorent has produced a superconcentrated wine, layering minerals, yellow fruits and pear skin structure touched lightly by caramel. There is great acidity throughout this impressive wine.",France
10747,France,"There's a luscious outer edge to this wine, with mango and peach flavors freshened with citrus. But at its dense core, it is all mineral, flinty, the wood present but certainly not dominant. It needs time, maybe 3–4 years.",France
10748,France,"A beautiful wine that floats its minerality, white flower aromas and white currant fruits over a foundation of toast. Freshness dominates this crisp wine, with intensity to finish.",France
10749,France,"This is a rare premier cru vineyard with its north-east exposure. In good years, like 2005, it can produce a wonderful expression of the mineral structure of fine Chablis. Apple and grapefruit flavors are at the forefront here; this certainly needs to age for 5–6 years.",France
10750,France,"A simple but easy-to-drink Chardonnay with soft aromas and flavors of ripe red apple and pear. Medium weight with a solid, clean finish.",France
10751,France,"Open, soft, creamy, along with a candied fruit character. There is freshness here, with the acidity dominant on the finish.",France
10752,France,"This wine is a blend of Chardonnay from different regions of France. It is light, fresh and clean, with some attractive white fruit flavors, lifted by some crisp acidity.",France
10753,France,"Very concentrated and closed up, like a coil. The intense green fruit is followed by plum skins. Crispness, dry but fresh, comes alongside a powerful explosion of flavors.",France
10754,France,"As so often with Mont-de-Milieu, this is a powerful, majestic wine, rich and ripe. The fruit is generous and dense, tinged with some citrus, flint honey and toast. Very full.",France
10755,France,"La Chablisienne vinifies this portion of Fourchaume premier cru separately, regarding it as almost grand cru in power. It is certainly a concentrated wine, very ripe, but lined with citrus acidity, crispness and structure. At the end, though, the richness comes out.",France
10756,France,"Grapefruit and other citrus fruits come through the rich fruit. There is power and crispness here, along with a sense of structure from the mineral, flinty character that underlies the fruit. Hold for for 3–4 years.",France
10757,France,"A solid, firmly structured, mineral wine, buoyed up by wood. It is very intense, nervous, just poised between richness and power. The yellow fruits, green plum skin acidity and the grapefruit crispness all blend well together.",France
10758,France,"Generous in style, with great freshness. The flavors are rich, touched by caramel, ripe white currants and some spice. A fine, red apple skin structure comes through to finish.",France
10759,France,"Open, generous and packed with butter and honey. Yellow fruits are the dominant character, touched with toast and ripeness. This is an opulent and full wine.",France
10760,France,"Concentrated, dense, powerful and full of glistening green fruits, this wine is lightly touched with caramel, but more dominated by ripe acidity. The aftertaste is tight, suggesting good aging potential.",France
10761,France,"Weighty, full-bodied, full of ripe yellow fruits. Here's a wine that is going to be a powerhouse, packed with intense flavors, touched by wood and a crisp edge. The aftertaste leaves minerality along with the ripe fruit.",France
10762,France,"This steep vineyard produces a particularly rich style of Chablis because of its excellent exposure. This wine exemplifies this. It is warm, and rounded, with superrich yellow fruits, almost tropical. Underlying it all is a structure derived from green plum skin flavors.",France
10763,France,"This is the second wine from the Château Grenouilles vineyard, very fresh, but at the same time weighty and concentrated, with wood, caramel and generous fruits. Age for 5 years.",France
10764,France,"This is Jean-Pierre Grossot's flagship wine. From around an acre of the Mont de Milieu vineyard, he produces an intensely ripe wine that pulls toward great minerality and steeliness. There is power as well, with just touches of wood.",France
10765,France,"With 24 acres in this premier cru vineyard, Laroche is able to produce this mineral- and grapefruit-flavored wine in good quantities. There is a touch of caramel, balanced with excellent lively acidity. A fresh but full-bodied wine that will age well over the next 2–3 years. Screwcap.",France
10766,France,"Growers based in Vertus, at the southern end of the Chardonnay-dominated Côte des Blancs, the Colin brothers have made a deliciously balanced wine that is rich, with some age, along with good concentration, weighty green fruits, and a touch of almonds.",France
10767,France,"Made from young vines from the Vaulorent portion of the Fourchaume vineyard, this is an open, rounded and lively wine with white fruits and weight, just lifted by acidity.",France
10768,France,"There's a fine balance here between minerality and rich toast. The result is a very pure but ripe wine, dominated by a good mix of ripe white fruits and honey.",France
10769,France,"Initially this is caramel and fresh fruit layered with acidity. Then the minerality kicks in with a vengeance, structuring the ripe green flavors, and leaving tense acidity.",France
10770,France,"A big, toasty wine, full of ripe, delicious fruit, veering toward opulence. There are open yellow fruits along with toast and butter tastes. This is almost ready to drink now; only the acidity promises some aging.",France
10771,France,"A very floral wine, poised and creamy. Already there is an almond character as the wine develops, but it still hasn't lost sight of the initial fresh green fruits. Drink now; it will only develop slightly.",US
10772,France,"Lively white fruit with a mineral edge. The flavors are just showing some signs of mature toast, but at the moment green, crisp tastes predominate. The sweet dosage —relatively high—seems to need time to integrate.",France
10773,France,Not terribly complex but certainly very approachable and easy to drink. Good acidity and medium weight play well with the flavors of orange and apple in the mouth.,France
10774,France,"Closed up and firm with a hint of vanilla, honey and refined acidity. There is some crispness here, green apples and a plum skin character. This is going to be serious Chardonnay; the minerality already in evidence.",France
10775,France,"This is definitely young, but the fresh fruit is already very apparent. There's a lifted, vibrant apple character that opens in the mouth to give yellow fruits with a finish of steel and gun flint sharpness.",France
10776,France,"This goes for the tropical fruit side of Chardonnay, a big mouthful of round, rich fruit, yellow pears, apricots, lifted by a touch of kiwi. There is a final crispness to keep the whole fruit salad in order.",France
10777,France,"A rounded, fruity wine, packed with yellow peaches and apricots, but held in check by freshness, green herbs and a firm, steely character. It's not a wine to age for long, but it is delicious, and very seductive now.",France
10778,France,"A recent discovery, this Chardonnay (yes, Chardonnay) has a striking bouquet of flowers, spices, honey and nuts, then adds a peachy fruit component on the palate. It's medium in weight, with a lush texture and a long finish. A super bargain to drink over the summer months.",US
10779,France,"From old vines, at least 50 years old, this shows good concentration, giving a dense, ripe, rounded wine full of green apple fruits, hints of vanilla and streaks of minerality.",France
10780,France,"For simple Chablis, this is impressive, rich, fruity, with wood as well as lively, fresh acidity. Nosings find toast and butter, with a hint of light honey.",France
10781,France,"A soft, ripe, open wine with yellow fruit flavors. There is opulent concentration, velvet in texture. Only on the finish is there freshness and real acidity. Screwcap.",France
10782,France,"This still tastes impressively young for a simple Chablis. In fact it isn't simple at all, showing all the intensity of a premier cru with its minerality, fresh lime and other citrus flavors, hints of honey and white fruits.",France
10783,France,"An open, full and fleshy wine, with just a hint of mineral character. It is round, flavored with white pears, almonds and finishing with crisp layers of acidity. The complexity is still developing.",France
10784,France,"Made from grand cru vineyards in Sillery, this is a well-balanced wine, with a dosage on the high side, but there's richness rather than sweetness. Enjoy the almost tropical fruits here.",France
10785,France,"Bone dry, this is a stunning wine that shows the aging qualities of the 1996 vintage as well as the intensity of Salon. It is packed with acidity and firm green fruits, leaving a twist of lemon and nuts on the finish.",US
10786,France,"A blanc de blancs, vinified in wood (15% new). It is rich, creamy, and still young with citrus and tropical fruits vying for dominance at this early stage. Wait for this wine to develop over the next five years—it will be magnificent.",France
10787,France,"Gorgeous, delicious fruit, with flavors of crisp apples and lemon zest underlined by an intensity of structure and flavor. There is just great depth to this impressive wine. The only flaw is that it is too young—wait another five years.",France
10788,France,"A delicious, welcoming, generous wine that also manages to keep the pure, mineral character of Chardonnay. It has a very direct, linear, steely taste. Great acidity plays a part, as do ripe, fruity flavors and fine balance. This wine should develop well, but it's delicious now.",France
10789,France,"Certainly an apéritif style, this is still a rich Chardonnay, toasty, developed, with white flower aromas and honey and citrus flavors, that hint at tropical fruits. This is a beautifully balanced wine, flowing through its development towards maturity, but still with good aging potential.",US
10790,France,"Better known for its blends dominated by Pinot Noir, Roederer is following the fashion for blanc de blancs in this very dry, but ripely toasty, full-bodied Chardonnay. It has superrich fruit, but still keeps a sense of proportion in its acidity and green plum flavors.",France
10791,France,"Erick de Sousa chose the name Caudalies, because it is a measure of how long the taste of a wine stays in the mouth, measured in seconds. This wine certainly lasts for many caudalies in the mouth. Packed with deep ripe-fruit flavors, powerful but also elegant, this is so rich, it almost has a tropical character.",France
10792,France,"A complex wine that is influenced by wood, but shows more of fresh lime and white currants. There's intense acidity, lifted green flavors and a round aftertaste.",France
10793,France,"This is a cool cru, which shows even in this great year with its structure, austerity and steely character. It makes it old-style Chablis, with its green fruits and lively, poised freshness.",France
10794,France,"Strong minerality with crisp, clean almost mouth-puckering green fruits that show structure. It is full-bodied and rich, but also with an edge of austerity.",France
10795,France,"This is light and floral both with its aromas and its palate. In the heart of the wine is a firm, crisp mineral layer, which blends into the apple skin and caramel, vanilla flavors. Drink 2009.",France
10796,France,"The aromas are almost honeyed, the palate is poised, elegant, crisply green. Despite its youth, this blanc de blancs shows delicious white fruit and crisp green flavors. Great as an apéritif, as it develops and ages, it should also be a good food wine.",France
10797,France,"From a 6-acre parcel of grand cru vines, this blanc de blancs is still very young. Its pink grapefruit and mineral characters accent a core of lively acidity. It needs time, another five years at least, but is already an impressive wine.",France
10798,France,"From the ripe, open 1995 vintage, this is a round wine with flavors of lemons, grapefruits and almonds. The angles of acidity have been turned into curves as it develops and softens. This is ready to drink now, but should age well over 5–10 years.",France
10799,France,"A blend from a number of premier cru vineyards, pulling together cooler and warmer sites in balance. It's fresh and light, showing elegance, green fruits and a floral character. Just a touch of minerality.",France
10800,France,"The Caudalies vintage comes from old vines—at least 50 years old. This 1999 is creamy, rich, very soft. It has apricots, ripe fruits, very open, generous and deliciously ready to drink.",France
10801,France,"Like all the Gimonnet wines, this is very dry, relying for its richness on the ripe Chardonnay (much of it grand cru from Cramant). This is crisp and clean, with pink grapefruit flavors that give it a lift and liveliness, and a fresh green aftertaste.",France
10802,France,"This blanc de blancs from biodynamic grower Pierre Larmandier  is bone dry, packed with delicious white fruit flavors, very crisp, but also full and rich. There is a great mineral edge to it, which shows how well it will age, but enjoy it now as well.",France
10803,France,"This is certainly Chardonnay, full of green apple and white fruit creaminess that is still suspended in acidity and needs time to soften and open. Lovely flavors of spiced pears give the wine a great future.",France
10804,France,"It must be the older vines, but compared to the simpler version of this wine, this has a firm structure of apple skins that goes well with the clean taste, the mouth-wateringly fresh acidity and green plum fruits.",US
10805,France,"A concentrated wine, just beginning to open up, with a serious, maybe austere mineral element, as well as vibrant kiwi and citrus flavors. It is softened by aging in older wood, giving some roundness to finish.",France
10806,France,"With superripe fruit, fat and glossy, with rich white fruits, round, dense and concentrated, this is a wine to ooze into the glass. It is perhaps not very Chablis, but delicious as a fine Chardonnay.",France
10807,France,"The extra amount of clay in the soil of this vineyard lends weight, richness and roundness. At the same time, it has fresh lime, an open character and a soft structure.",France
10808,France,"While the Amour de Deutz, the other blanc de blancs from Deutz is very much in the apéritif style, this blanc de blancs is more of a food wine. It has structure, lemon zest, peaches and other white fruits and a touch of honey. Already somewhat evolved, but still fresh.",US
10809,France,"Unusual in the Philipponnat range (normally dominated by Pinot Noir), this blanc de blancs is a blend of Chardonnays from the Côte des Blancs and from the Montagne de Reims. It is lightly toasty, dry and fresh with a creamy texture and white fruit flavors. It's ready to drink, very light, poised and crisp.",France
10810,France,"From a vineyard run on biodynamic principles, this wine boasts good, fresh fruit, with great green, crisp acidity and green plum intensity. It's very lively and fresh, but full-bodied.",France
10811,France,"A richly soft, creamy wine, dominated by flavors of white currants and chives, this is full-bodied and still young. There is enough ripe acidity and full-flavored fruit to see it develop well over five years.",France
10812,France,"For a Petit Chablis, this is serious and complex, with delicious ripe green and yellow fruits; there is a touch of caramel with toast just at the edge.",France
10813,France,"A ripe, soft wine, one that's creamy on the palate. There is just a touch of caramel, but the main flavors are of crystallized lemons, pears and honey. This is delicious, fresh, and a great aperitif wine.",US
10814,France,"A lively, crisp blanc de blancs that comes from Chouilly in the Côtes des Blancs. It is green, flavored with cinnamon, baked apples along with some good, steely fruit.",France
10815,France,"Named after the river that flows past Chablis, this is a ripe, fruity wine, with yellow fruit flavors and good ripeness. Unoaked, it has good concentration as well as richness.",France
10816,France,"The name “Not so little” is a joking reference to its appellation. This is a pleasure, a delicious unoaked Chardonnay with green fruits, a touch of caramel and kiwi fruit flavors.",France
10817,France,"Toasty aromas are the first hints that this is now a mature wine. Its layers of acidity mingle with toast, walnuts and rich, mature fruit. Definitely a wine for those who prefer their bubblies with some age.",France
10818,France,"If a Faiveley Burgundy could ever be accused of having a slightly New World style, this would be the one. It shows classic Burgundian notes of toasted nuts and a lovely mealy texture, but also great generosity of fruit, ranging from pear and apple to honey and melon. Drink now–2010.",US
10819,France,"Full, in a rich style, this is a ripe wine packed with juicy green fruits. There are pears, ripe apple skins and a good citrus edge. A fresh, easily drinkable wine.",France
10820,France,"A ripe, crisp, very fresh Chablis bursting with green fruits, with a light layer of caramel and green herbs. Delicious now.",France
10821,France,"This single-vineyard blanc de blancs premier cru is, curiously, more mature than the 1997 version of the same wine. It is ripe, open, generous, with perfumed cantaloupe and just a hint of structure. Drink now, it is delicious.",France
10822,France,"This is fresh and lively with great citrus flavors and a firm structure. On the dry side, it shows crispness, apple-skin flavors and a light, poised, elegant character. Will age over the mid term.",France
10823,France,"Floral and fresh, this is very much in the light Delamotte style. White fruits dominate the palate. Balanced and poised overall.",France
10824,France,"A fresh, simple wine, all crisp green fruit with ripe apples and a touch of grapefruit. Delicious; drink now. Screwcap.",France
10825,France,"Lively and fresh, this shows all the crispness of young, unwooded Chardonnay, touched with vanilla and simple green fruits. Drink now.",France
10826,France,"Intended as a vintage to be drunk young, this is a skilful blend of different fresh, relatively light Chardonnays. It is crisp, a great apéritif wine, although with its particularly tiny bubbles, it is also good as a food wine.",France
10827,France,"Notes of toast and smoky quartz show on the nose, then add pear and apple flavors on the palate. From a Faiveley monopole in Mercurey, this shows a fair amount of minerality on the finish and a plump palate presence. Drink now and over the next few years.",US
10828,France,"No, not the goddess: Venus is the name of the horse that plows the Agrapart vineyards. This wine, labeled “nature”—without dosage—is all green apples and very dry. It's distinctive, but many would find it too distinctive because of its rather lean edge, and very acidic aftertaste.",US
10829,France,"A soft, very open, lightweight wine, that has some richness along with its white fruits. It tastes sweet, from what appears to be a relatively high dosage.",France
10830,France,"A simple, fresh wine, with flavors of crisp, green apples and a touch of pear. It is light, poised, clean and ready to drink.",France
10831,France,"A soft, ripe, creamy wine that works because of its fine balance between soft fruit flavors and a line of acidity. There is some intensity of flavor from the old-vine fruits. Enjoy over the next two or three years.",France
10832,France,"A delicious apéritif style of Champagne, with nutty aromas, crisp, creamy fruit, and a delicate aftertaste. It should age attractively, over the next five years.",US
10833,France,"White fruits, almonds and soft, crisp acidity are the hallmarks of this lightweight, fresh wine.",France
10834,France,"Somewhat earthy and rustic, this is a fresh wine, with citrus notes and some yeastiness. The wine's fruit has finishing liveliness and crispness.",US
10835,France,"With vineyards in the Côte des Bar, in the south of Champagne, the Moutard-Diligent family can trace its origins in the region back to the 17th century. This is a soft wine, a blanc de blancs (although only the back label indicates this). It is very ripe and creamy, benefiting from the warm conditions of the 1999 harvest, and just showing a touch of acidity to finish.",France
10836,France,"This still white wine from the Champagne region is produced from one parcel of old Chardonnay vines. With spicy wood aromas, and dominant wood flavors, the actual taste of the fruit is hard to discern. There's intense acidity. A curiosity, and a reminder that Champagne is better sparkling.",France
10837,France,"A very soft wine, dominated by a creamy character and fresh acidity. Very lively, very light, great as an apéritif.",France
10838,France,"A soft, smooth, apples-and-cream-flavored wine, shot with acidity and some green fruit. It's a light wine, very crisp and clean, better with food than as an apéritif.",France
10839,France,"Plump and honeyed, this is a solid offering from a region in which Faiveley can't fall back on its vineyards. Pear, apple and honey flavors finish soft, with gentle chalky nuances. Drink now.",France
10840,France,"The latest release from Salon, this just explodes in the mouth with mineral, steel and flint. The tiny mousse has flavors of yeast and just a touch of toast. It is rich, but so austere and structured. Like many Salon Champagnes, this will age for 20 years or more.",France
10841,France,"While the Larmandier's main vineyard is in Vertus, they also have a parcel in the grand cru vineyard of Cramant. It is full of beautifully ripe fruit, beginning to round out as it ages. Green fruits and white pears, as well as yeast are still dominant; drink 2010.",France
10842,France,"Although this is marked nonvintage, the fruit all comes from 2004. It is made from old vines, giving richness and ripeness, and a generous white fruit character which fully compensates for the very dry nature of the wine. It's delicious, a complex wine of intense character.",France
10843,France,"Based mainly on vines in Le Mesnil-sur-Oger, this impressive wine is superbly rich with just the merest hint of age. With its lively mousse, secondary aromas of mocha and flavors of green apples, it is a wine that should develop magnificently over the next 4–5 years.",US
10844,France,"Made entirely from grand cru grapes, this is a beautiful wine, layering toast and ripe fruit with a proper minerality from the year. Flavors of honey, toast and nougat soften the aftertaste. It is ready to drink now, but it has still a ways to go, as the intense concentration of fruit opens out.",France
10845,France,"Named not after the goddess of love, but the horse that Agrapart uses to plough the vines, this superb wine comes from 50-year-old vines, the clay   element in the soil giving richness, the minerality giving balance, lifting up the yellow fruit flavors with excellent acidity.",France
10846,France,"Disgorged in 2006, this wine (and it is a wine, almost more than a Champagne) is young, dry and touched with green plums, secondary flavors of toast and yeast, as well as an white flower perfume.",US
10847,France,"The 1996 vintage really brings out the minerality in a wine. This grand cru is still austere, very crisp, with some smokiness, apple-skin flavors and intense freshness. Give it another 5–6 years.",US
10848,France,"From 90-year-old vines in Le Mesnil-sur-Oger, this is a superbly ripe wine, full-bodied, concentrated with a great swathe of minerality going through. This is still young, based on the 2004 vintage, but shows every sign of developing into a beautifully toasty maturity.",France
10849,France,"The fact that this wine comes from the chalkiest of soils and is bone dry gives it considerable austerity. It is definitely mineral in taste and texture, with a touch of salt and grapefruit flavors;  very structured and tight. It needs to age.",France
10850,France,"Ripe grapefruit, green plums and other green stone fruits all show that this wine has some weight, allied with a steely interior. Still young, it fills the mouth with yeast and some toast, but more of an intense freshness.",France
10851,France,"With its highly mineral aroma, this is almost like smelling chalk. It's an austere wine, with high acidity, crystal clear on the palate, full of grapefruit flavors and flint texture. Age this wine at least 4 years.",France
10852,France,"Wood maturation gives this wine roundness, despite its dryness. At the moment, it is too young, very vigorous, and touched by caramel. The feeling is of a weighty, structured wine, even though the aftertaste is fresh.",France
10853,France,"This is part of a range which returns to origins, with wood fermentation for the wines. Perfumed, green initially and then showing flavors of lychees and earthiness, this has some oak toast, but more of an open flavor from light (and pleasing) oxidation.",France
10854,France,"Still very young, this wine needs time to develop its intense minerality. Now it is more about grapefruit and yeast, although it is also full-bodied, a sign of the 1999 vintage. Wait five years at least.",France
10855,France,"With its yeasty aromas and fresh, crisp acidity, this is a young-tasting Champagne. There are flavors of green apples, just a hint of toast and a dry aftertaste from the low dosage.",France
10856,France,"This comes from high up in the Chevalier-Montrachet vineyard, from vines surrounding a small workers shed, the “cabotte.” It is the better of the two bottlings from this vineyard by Bouchard, although “better” here is like differentiating between two stars on top form. It has great poise, so although the richness is there, it is shot through with acidity and citric flavors that underline the huge, ripe fruit. Age for 10 years for best results.",France
10857,France,"As Anne-Claude Leflaive describes it, this wine is all about the complexity of the vineyard's soil. There is minerality and finesse from the chalk, which gives a structure. And at the same time the ripe fruit seems opulent, with vanilla and spice flavors adding something exotic. Age this wine for at least 5 years.",France
10858,France,"A fine wine that offers power, generosity and also a chalky, mineral character. No wonder Montrachet is seen as the greatest grand cru—it has structure, concentration, delicious fruit and layers of complexity. It also needs to age. To drink this wine now would be more than a shame.",France
10859,France,"This is a beautifully shaped wine that rises from a quiet opening. Muted and slightly closed up at this stage, it opens opulently but with balanced acidity and crispness, as well as richness and restrained power.",France
10860,France,"A wine of promise, but still in its infancy. This grand cru, structured and still waiting to open to its full opulence, is packed with concentrated flavors. It's a powerhouse that needs at least five years to even begin to show its structure, ripe fruit and richness.",France
10861,France,"This wine is deceptive. At first smell and taste, it doesn't show much—its spice and green-fruit aromas are not at all obvious. It's when you roll it around your mouth, that all the layers of flavor emerge. It is powerful, rounded, but with a fine line of minerality that holds the whole wine on a knife edge. The wood is beautifully judged, the fruit just beginning to develop secondary aromas. Hold for several years.",France
10862,France,"The richness of this wine envelops you from the start. It is all about opulence, but it's balanced with layers of ripe fruit and wood. At this stage in its long life, this wine from a fine white wine vintage is still dominated by fruit. The secondary flavors will start to show in 3–4 years time. A powerful wine that does not lose sight of a potential partnership with food.",France
10863,France,"From grand cru vines in Avize, Oger, Cramant and Oiry, this is full and intensely flavored, with very crisp apple and white pear flavors. To finish, the wine rounds out with vanilla and smooth textures.",US
10864,France,"This emblematic cuvée from Mumm (known for many years as Crémant de Cramant because it was bottled at a slightly lower pressure) is a celebration of grand cru Chardonnay in Cramant. It is a finely structured, relatively full-bodied wine, showing toast and butter flavors along with the pink grapefruit and crisp apple tastes.",France
10865,France,"It's not so much the fruit but the richness and concentration that mark this wine. Yet it's not superripe because of the hot 2003 vintage. This wine, with its origins in biodynamically grown grapes, preserves a great purity of fruit as it layers intense almond and citrus flavors over vanilla and yellow fruit tastes. It should age well.",France
10866,France,"Mineral and structured, this is a wine that is very linear and almost austere. There is elegance, fruit and wood along with a hint of ripe plums and peaches. But always that minerality, that steely character, which promise long aging.",France
10867,France,"This is the one grand cru that is entirely in Chassagne-Montrachet. It's a tiny patch of land (4.13 acres) making wines that are more delicate than the others. With its fine, fresh flavors so light to the taste, this is a wine that floats on the palate with a smooth, silky texture. Wood and white peaches contribute but do not dominate.",France
10868,France,"The most well known of Puligny's premier cru vineyards, Les Combettes is at the very heart of the slope. This central position shows in this dense and concentrated wine that's big, powerful and marked by fresh fruit-salad flavors of green figs, green apple and spice. The whole is borne up by a fine, solid structure of wood and tannins.",France
10869,France,"This is the smallest of the grand crus of Puligny-Montrachet, a mere 8.6 acres. This wine shows the vineyard's typical elegance, with delicious flavors of pears,  almonds and vanilla, hovering on the palate for minutes, leaving a dancing freshness.",France
10870,France,"The pinnacle of the white wines from Roux Père et Fils, this is  properly opulent, gorgeously rich, spicy and full of quince and lychee flavors, along with a discrete layer of new wood. Its complexity pays due respect to the quality of the vineyard. Keep for many years.",France
10871,France,"Rich and ample, this is an impressive wine. The fruit and wood flavors work together to give a feeling of seriousness and great ageability. With its spice, toast notes and dark-hued structure, this will age well over the next five to 10 years.",France
10872,France,"Relatively closed up at this stage, not giving much, this wine is all about freshness, poised but rich fruit and a structure that suggests long-term development. The wood is quite prominent, overshadowing what will be delicious yellow-fruit flavors. Come back to this wine in five years—it will be magnificent.",France
10873,France,"Bâtard-Montrachet is the largest of the white grand crus, yielding archetypal fat, open, generous white Burgundies. Louis Jadot's wine does not disappoint. It's a powerfully ripe, opulent wine that's generous and packed with delicious fruit balanced with a judicious touch of wood.",France
10874,France,"Relatively tight and closed up at this stage, this wine is all about freshness, poised but rich fruit and a structure that suggests long-term development. The wood is quite prominent, overshadowing what will be delicious yellow-fruit flavors. Come back to this wine in 5 years time—it will be magnificent.",France
10875,France,"While the wood aromas dominate, on the palate, there is a much richer, rounder character. This wine, with its huge fruit, white peach flavors, layers of wood and citrus, is just waiting to burst out of its youth. Delicious ripeness and acidity lend balance, while the oak needs some time to calm down and mature.",France
10876,France,"An intense, complex wine that flows unctuously with rich white fruits, spice, vanilla, some toast and a great depth of flavor. At this stage, the toast is quite dominant, but the rich fruit is on its way up. Like many great white Burgundies, this wine needs to be opened well in advance of drinking.",France
10877,France,"Like many wines from Lafon, this is initially deceptive. It bursts open in the mouth, like a fruit bomb. But watch for the structure as well, because this is a wine that will age. Keep for at least 5 years.",US
10878,France,"A structured wine that is going to need 4 or 5 years to really open up. Already there is power and intense green-fruit flavors, but at the moment new-wood flavors are dominant. Don't drink now.",France
10879,France,"Blending grapes from two vineyards—Les Case-Têtes (broken heads, so called from the steepness of the slope) and Les Murgers de Monthelie—Patrick Javillier has created a big, bold, ripe wine that keeps a mineral, crisp center. The toast from 11 months in wood is beginning to calm down, and this will age magnificently.",France
10880,France,"Full, but structured, this is a wine that shows a serious side to Meursault. It layers fine stone-fruit flavors with crisp apple skins and some fresh toast and butter. It should improve over 5 years.",France
10881,France,"This delicious, crisp wine reveals the more delicate side of Chardonnay. Coming from one of the high vineyards in La Grande Montagne of Chassagne, it has pure, elegant freshness, supplemented by a touch of vanilla.",US
10882,France,"Very intense, very nervy wine, living on a thin wire of grapefruit and other citrus flavors but much more about pure structure. The aftertaste shows great concentration.",France
10883,France,"This is full, perhaps heavy, but certainly with a fine, powerful character. The acidity and the green-apple texture are at one with the white-fruit flavors, which gives extra richness to the wine. Just a hint of mineral can be detected.",France
10884,France,"Toasty, floral and full-bodied, with a soft aftertaste, this has a great aromatic swathe initially, with only hints of Chardonnay minerality. The wine is delicious, with ripe white fruits and light acidity to finish.",France
10885,France,"Made from 60-year-old vines, evidenced by its concentration and serious ageability. It is structured, firm and relatively dry at this young stage. It's a wine that needs at least 5 years. Today, if you do open a bottle, watch for the mineral, stony character that pushes the fruit and demands attention.",France
10886,France,"The reputation of Les Combettes for charm is borne out by this deliciously ripe wine. It has layers of fresh fruit flavors, a touch of spice from the wood, and a long aftertaste. And, for the future, the acidity and the underlying structure promise at least 5 years of evolution.",France
10887,France,"You can almost taste the stones that give this vineyard its name. This is a mineral, firm, tight wine that demands time to develop. The fruit is there, with flavors of white currants, but wait for this wine—at least four years.",France
10888,France,"A crisp, steely, minerally wine that's packed with fruit that is poised to come out over the next few years. It is firm, taut and on a tight rein at this stage. Oak gives a spicy element. Keep for at least three years.",France
10889,France,"An intense, well-balanced wine with deliciously ripe yet lively green-fruit flavors. The wood is integrated, providing a cushioning richness to what is already a delicious wine. Girardin owns 3.7 acres in Les Folatières.",France
10890,France,"The complexities of Burgundy! This is the vineyard next to the more familiar Les Charmes, just up the slope—hence dessus, meaning above. This vineyard gives a mineral character, hinting at Chablis, but with some Meursault richness as well. Hold this wine, with its delicious vanilla flavors, and it will be ready in a year.",France
10891,France,"Full-bodied, big-hearted, ripe and joyful, this is a welcoming, enticing wine. Flavors of green plums, nutmeg and fresh citrus are part of the pleasure. But so are the open, generous, almost opulent flavors.",France
10892,France,"A ripe, open, generous wine, the opulent side of white Burgundy. This wine revels in its fruit, full flavors and touch of wood. This wine opens well and is ready to drink now, but should age over 4–5 years.",France
10893,France,"It's not a bad name for this vineyard—Charmes. This wine, which expresses the nature of the vineyard, is certainly approachable, friendly almost. But there's also a steel fist there that demands time. And if you can't wait, it's a great wine to drink now.",France
10894,France,"New-wood aromas, plenty of spice and yellow fruits, but also a beautifully-shaped wine. It's complex yet generous, ripe yet elegant. For village Meursault, this is excellent.",France
10895,France,"Pierre Morey also runs a small negociant business, Morey Blanc, specializing in whites from Meursault. This is one of the wines, a delicious, fresh, crisp wine that's packed with light, airy flavors of green apples and citrus.",France
10896,France,"There are at least four vineyards in Meursault called Charmes. Wines called Les Charmes can use fruit from both Les Charmes Dessus (above) and Les Charmes Dessous (below). This wine from René Monnier shows round, luscious fruit flavors balanced with some spicy toast and richness. The wine is ready to drink.",France
10897,France,"Coming from the largest of the Puligny premier crus, this is a big, bold, ripe wine.  Still structured at this young stage, but generous and packed with green plum and lime flavors. The wood gives tannins but doesn't dominate.",France
10898,France,"This wine is beginning to get some age to it, but remains fresh. There is some toast, even coffee, while the aftertaste is soft and slightly candied.",France
10899,France,"The softness of the 1999 vintage is very apparent in this approachable wine. It is full, round, only just touched by minerality, white fruits and some almonds giving weight and character.",France
10900,France,"A good wine, this is a young, aromatic Chardonnay with lively white fruits bursting from the acidity.",France
10901,France,"In the fat, buttery style of white Burgundy, this wine, with its malolactic flavors and its vanilla flavors, would appeal immediately to California Chardonnay lovers. Except that it also has elegance: a hint of steel and a touch of acidity to temper the tropical fruits.",France
10902,France,"From the Bouchard domaine, this wine is soft and ripe. There is some structure and firm acidity, but that's secondary to the luscious flavors that roll around the mouth. The wood broadens but also gives extra complexity to the wine.",France
10903,France,"Chenevottes is situated high up on the Chassagne-Montrachet slope, above the grand cru vineyards. With its fat, ripe butter and coconut milk character, this wine offers an immediately appealing style. But there is a hint of ageability in its layers of serious wood and structure.",US
10904,France,"A wine that caresses the palate with initial silky, ripe-fruit flavors and then comes on with structure and acidity. The wood shows through but certainly doesn't dominate. A wine that has power, but also great charm.",France
10905,France,"Rich and spiced with wood flavors, this is a rounded, powerful wine. The flavors suggest kiwis and pears leading to vanilla and caramel. It is developing well and is ready to drink.",France
10906,France,"Still tasting young, and not yet showing all its power, this is still an impressive wine. It is firm and structured, with citrus and mineral flavors dominating the concentrated fruit. The wood shows through via a warm spiciness. This will certainly age for 5 years or more.",France
10907,France,"This shows the more racy, fresh side of Meursault. It's a wine that dances and jumps around the mouth. Light but still full of delicious green fruits. The wood is there, but it's such a delicate touch.",France
10908,France,"A lively, almost racy wine that has delicious ripe fruit, lovely fresh acidity, lemon and green-apple flavors and an appealing layer of new wood. Chardonnay lovers, this is for you.",France
10909,France,"Ripe and at the same time structured, this wine is as broad as its palate is long. It envelops the mouth with nutmeg and almonds as well as white fruits and ripe acidity. It's delicious now, but there's structure to allow it a few years aging.",France
10910,France,"Big, intense and ripe, this wine has great flavors of ripe apples, almonds and honey from the malolactic fermentation. It is poised, elegant and powerful—a balance that is the best of many worlds. From the Roux domaine, it is finely crafted and likely to age for many years.",France
10911,France,"Perhaps the best-known of the Chassagne-Montrachet premier crus, Morgeot is a wine that delights the taste buds. Moreau's example has enticing flowery aromas, ripe red apple and fresh almond flavors, and a friendly, open character that is tempered with some fresh acidity.",France
10912,France,"Like so many Drouhin wines, this is beautifully balanced. The wood, green fruit, spice and acidity already in fine harmony. There is a richness coming from the deep soils of the vineyard. Can it age? Probably, because of the firm structure.",France
10913,France,"With its sandstone soil, the Abbaye de Morgeot vineyard is equally suited to Pinot Noir as to Chardonnay. But it is able to produce fresh, fruity wines, like this one. A spice and citric blend dances on the palate.",France
10914,France,"Producing some of the more refined wines of Meursault, Charmes also has the right amount of opulence. Louis Latour's wine brings out all the richness and ripeness; soft, generous and full-bodied and leavened with spicy wood flavors.",France
10915,France,"Perrières is often described as the greatest of the premier crus of Meursault. Wines like this certainly need aging, with their structure overlying the typical opulence of Meursault. It's possible to enjoy this now, but it would be worth waiting 3–4 years at least.",US
10916,France,"Leflaive owns a small parcel of vines in the Clos Saint-Marc and also buys grapes from neighbors. The wine is ripe, but still has restraint, with flavors of green plums and a touch of spice. A firm structure promises aging, and there's a delicious fresh zing to the finish.",France
10917,France,"More steely than some Meursault, this layers wood and mineral flavors with a fine structure and tastes of apple skins and nutmeg. This wine could age 3–4 years, but it is already delicious.",France
10918,France,"More toast than fruit even at this young stage, this is a ripe wine, showing big woody, toasty flavors that leave freshness behind. There are flavors of cream, caramel and wood here. Acidity appears on the finish.",France
10919,France,"Elegance is the hallmark of this wine, which flows round the mouth with generous flavors but still leaves a fresh, crisp aftertaste. Green apples, spice and wood all balance well.",France
10920,France,"Blagny is a small hamlet just up the hill from Les Perrières. This is a cooler spot, and the wine shows this with its structure and flavors of fresh green fruits over generous portions of wood. A wine that should age for more than 5 years.",France
10921,France,"From the domaine of Pierre Morey, who is also cellarmaster at Domaine Leflaive. Like at Leflaive, he works his vines biodynamically. This is a layered wine; the pure, crisp fruit partnering with light toast flavors and a poised and structured apple-skin aftertaste.",France
10922,France,"Ripe, open and packed with melon and tropical fruit flavors, this wine is already showing enticing drinkability. Its fresh, ripe fruits is layered with some mineral character and an under-cushion of wood.",France
10923,France,"Lacking intensity, the nose exhibits mild notes of ripe red apple while the palate adds a touch of canteloupe. Fat and round with a fleeting finish, the wine never really makes a strong impression.",US
10924,France,"Shows remarkable minerality and restraint for a 2003, with a nuanced nose of crushed stone and smoke, then delivers rich, enveloping flavors of honey, minerals and tree fruits. Tremendous length on the mouthcoating finish is its final indication of quality. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",France
10925,France,"Tasted twice, two months apart. This wine was fabulous on both occasions, combining the fat, fleshy ripeness and honeyed fruit of the vintage with the minerality of its grand cru site. Smoke, citrus and toasted nuts round out the flavors, which finish long and complex. Delicious now, but should hold several years at least. Imported by Vintus LLC.",France
10926,France,"Richly honeyed on the nose, with layers of mineral that lure you in. Tastes like honey-drizzled wet riverstones with a squeeze of citrus—mouthfilling yet precise. Long and intense on the finish. Imported by Monsieur Henri Wine Co.",France
10927,France,"Rich and ripe, with buttery, toasty aromas that are also reminiscent of bacon fat. Full-bodied, with ample apple and citrus fruit flavors that come to a climax in the long, hazelnut-tinged finish. Lovely, but with its rather low acidity, it looks to be a Burgundy to drink rather than to cellar. Imported by Vintus LLC.",France
10928,France,"Starts off with some forceful charred aromas and some rustic, unintegrated notes on the finish, but give this wine some time to settle down and it shines. Grilled peaches and roasted cashews mingle easily with mineral notes, and what the finish lacks in finesse at this stage it makes up in power. Better in 2008. Imported by Vintus LLC.",France
10929,France,"The dominant pear and melon notes actually come across as a bit austere despite the wine not being hugely mineral upfront. Where this wine shows its pedigree is on the long finish, which picks up anise and flint notes and a rich, plush texture. Imported by Monsieur Henri Wine Co.",France
10930,France,"This mouthfilling Chard adds hints of honey and acacia blossom to luscious aromas of toasted nuts and citrus. Honey, nuts, mineral and citrus notes mingle easily on the palate, while the finish picks up hints of oaky spice and orange peel. Low acid ity suggests early consumption; drink now–2010. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",France
10931,France,"Flinty yet honeyed at the same time, this full-bodied wine delivers concentrated flavors of pear, melon, dried spices and honey. Easy enough to drink now, yet should hold for at least five years despite relatively low acids. Long and silky-textured on the finish. Imported by Monsieur Henri Wine Co.",US
10932,France,"Excellent quality for a villages wine, with layers of peaches and tropical fruit over a core of mineral and spice. Full-bodied and harmonious, with a long finish that echoes with peach, mineral and oak. Drink now. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co. —J.C.",US
10933,France,"Shows more acid and minerality than many 2003s. There's apple, pear and citrus, all wrapped around a minerally core, with hints of honey and anise on the finish. Imported by Frederick Wildman & Sons, Ltd.",France
10934,France,"Intensely fruity, with layers of fresh ripe peaches and hints of grilled fruit. There are also traces of roasted nuts, vanilla and smoke, making this one pleasurable and complex experience. Nicely expansive and textured in the mouth; the only quibble is that it falls away quickly on the finish. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",France
10935,France,"A fresh, but full-bodied wine, which has aromas of citrus and sawn wood. It is ripe, smooth, with vanilla layers sandwiched between green fruits and white currants. This makes an attractive food wine for fish and white meat dishes.",France
10936,France,"Fruity and simple, with green apple and citrus aromas and flavors that are direct and satisfying, even if they're not particularly nuanced. Medium-weight; picks up some herbal notes on the finish.",France
10937,France,"This unoaked Chardonnay has some sligtly nutty qualities on the nose, allied to a bit of peach. It's unabashedly ripe, a bit heavy and alcholic, but at least it offers more texture than your typical Pays d'Oc Chard. Pear and spice flavors round out the package.",France
10938,France,"Supple, soft fruit gives this wine a simple easy-drinking character. It's great for apéritifs, rich enough for food and just plain enjoyable.",France
10939,France,"A good value in Chablis, this bottling from the Boisset group offers steely scents of lime and minerals to go with austere, grapefruity flavors. It's a bit plump on the midpalate, yet finishes with enough cut to merit a recommendation. Imported by Boisset America.",France
10940,France,"A slight disappointment, but still very good, with honey, smoke, caramel and peaches. It's a bit over-the-top from a house known for restraint, but the superripe fruit is backed by some dry minerality. Bold and weighty, but not that long. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",France
10941,France,"Seems slightly austere on the nose, with modest pear and melon fruit. But this medium-weight wine is more interesting on the palate, where it hints at honey, then flips direction and gives up gravelly stones and tough-skinned pears. Imported by Dreyfus, Ashby & Co.",France
10942,France,"Soft, light and fresh, this wine has attractive acidity as well as crisp, green flavors. There's a touch of vanilla which broadens it out. It's a solid, ready-to-drink wine.",France
10943,France,"Starts off promising, with hints of roasted nuts and grilled peaches, but seems to lose steam as it goes down. Still, the modest peach and pear flavors finish smoothly.",France
10944,France,"A hint of butteriness, grilled nuts and ripe peaches give this wine a bit of California-esque quality. It's plump and ripe in the mouth, then turns a bit tart and metallic on the finish.",US
10945,France,"The bubbles here aren't very plentiful or vigorous, but this wine offers pleasant peach, orange and toast flavors, a soft mousse and a clean, fresh finish. A decent value in bubbly, just don't expect a lot of bubble.",US
10946,France,"Decently made but modest Chardonnay, with melon flavors that turn tart and earthy, veering toward grapefruit on the finish.",US
10947,France,"Full-bodied flavors of tropical fruits give this wine richness and ripeness. It is simple, straightforward with immediately attractive depth of flavor. No complexity here.",France
10948,France,"Slightly nutty and plywoody on the nose, partially redeemed by a plump mouthfeel. Flavors tend toward unripe pear and grapefruit.",France
10949,France,"There are sweet vanilla aromas, along with aromas of green plums. This is a soft, creamy wine, with just a touch of greeness, and a full, creamy texture.",US
10950,France,"No lack of weight here, but the heaviness isn't well balanced by big fruit or crisp acids. Instead you get modest pear and peach flavors and a short finish.",France
10951,France,"Offers very soft fruit, open and rounded. There is some acidity, some flavor of melon and pears complemented with toast and an edge of citrus. The finish is lightly mineral.",France
10952,France,"A 100% Chardonnay blanc de blancs that is presented without any dosage to soften the acidity. Yet it doesn't seem to matter, because this Champagne is deliciously ripe, packed with mature fruit flavors, a touch of almonds to go with the white currant tastes and a layer of toastiness. Imported by Michael Skurnik Wines.",France
10953,France,"From five grand cru vineyards in the Côte des Blancs, this 100% Chardonnay is a great wine, with some toast and almond flavors showing good bottle age, along with freshness, finesse, ripe white fruits and a structured, lingering aftertaste. Imported by Robert Chadderdon Selections.",France
10954,France,"Made by a vigneron, which means a guy named Lavantureux actually grew the grapes and made the wine himself. It also means, at least in theory, that it received a lot of TLC. Not cheap, but an excellent value among French Chardonnay. It offers nothing but the purest of fruit: pineapple, mango, apple and then a smooth slide toward a sleek finish. Seek the vintage if possible. Yet another winner courtesy of veteran importer Kermit Lynch.",US
10955,France,"Striking a great balance between elegance and richness, this shows plenty of sweet fruit, white peaches and quince, while also keeping poise with  its structure and finishing acidity. This will be a great food Chardonnay.",France
10956,France,"Great toasty aromas sweep out of the glass with this delicious wine. It has ripe fruit rather than high dosage, giving the richness of Chardonnay with tastes of white peaches and apricots. A fine wine.  Imported by Michael Skurnik Wines.",France
10957,France,"Produced from biodynamically cultivated vineyards. This wine gushes fruit, with great pure crisp flavors and deliciously clean acidity as part of the finish. Imported by Michael Skurnik Wines.",France
10958,France,"No doubt Le Roi Soleil (Louis XIV, the Sun King) would have downed plenty of Champagne given half a chance, so I'm surprised this is the first wine I have come across named after one of history's great hedonists. This is actually quite a delicate wine, crisp and fresh, with a deliciously clean streak of acidity.",US
10959,France,"Enticing aromas of white fruits set the scene for a wine that is very fresh, very crisp, the epitome of dry, clean, delicious Chardonnay. It has great acidity and a crisp, clear dry aftertaste. Imported by Henriot USA.",France
10960,France,"Formerly known as Crémant de Cramant (a name now banned because it refers to sparkling wines from Burgundy, Alsace, the Loire and Limoux), Mumm continues to make this blanc de blancs, which is famed for its lightness. It is great to see they are also giving the wine some bottle age, which brings out delicious, toasty, nutty characters. Imported by Allied Domecq Wines USA.",US
10961,France,"A piercingly steely wine, all angles and acidity. That said, there's a greater depth of flavor that needs time to come out—the richness of the green fruit is there, as is the hint of wood. The corners need to soften for a year or so.",France
10962,France,"Rich, full and spiced with generous wood, this is deliciously fat Meursault. Almost honeyed in flavor and given backbone by some minerality; there's good ripeness here. An almost opulent wine.",France
10963,France,"There's good concentration with this wine. It shows green apples, pears and green plum skin flavors. On top, there is wood, well balanced with the fruit; a sumptuous mix that shows the generosity of 2005.",France
10964,France,"“Fullness and goodness” is a rough translation of the name of this wine. It's an accurate description of its richness. There is great spice, bolstering the full fruit, showing a mineral, chalky structure along with fresh green fruits.",France

10966,France,"Great fresh Chardonnay flavors give this Champagne a good lift. It is fresh, but has some good structure, as well as enticing, creamy, nutty flavors. The acidity gives the whole wine a sense of crispness.",US
10967,France,"This  comes from the 88-acre Domaine des Deux Roches. Big and rich, but freshened with great acidity. The fruits are green, given a tightness by minerality and wood. Drink this summer with freshly-caught trout by the camp fire.",France
10968,France,"This is a very polished modern style of Champagne. It has almond flavors, layered with toast and green fruit. In the delicate style of Bruno Paillard Champagnes, this is certainly an apéritif wine. Imported by Vintus LLC.",US
10969,France,"Biscuit aromas are a good starter for this bone-dry Champagne, which works because of bottle aging. It is crisp, full of biscuit tastes with some green fruits. It also has a tannic structure; piercingly dry overall. Imported by De Saint Gall.",France
10970,France,"Mainly from the lieu dit vineyard of Crotot, this is powerful, rounded in the way that Meursault should be. The fruit is ripe, filling the mouth with apples and cream flavors, topped by understated wood.",France
10971,France,"Muscular, powering its way with richness and structured tannins. The white pear and almond flavors seem to sit on top of this dense wine, which will need to age. It reflects the super-rich side of white Burgundy in 2005.",France
10972,France,"A limited production wine from Labouré-Roi's own vineyards, this is powerful and ripe, but tempered with refreshing acidity. With its spice and ginger flavors, it rolls richly around the mouth, and then finishes crisp and fresh.",France

10977,France,"Very open and ripe, touched with wood and centered around some creamy red apple and green pear flavors. The wood comes through strongly later, leaving a powerful vanilla aftertaste.",France
10978,France,"A rich, lush melange of fruit and nuts, with sinuous, almost unctuous flavors that twine around the palate like a snake. Long, fascinating finish, elegantly balanced and precise.",France
10979,France,"A very fruity wine with toast and maturity. It also has a creamy texture, but the finish is spoiled by some unbalanced sweetness. Imported by Moët Hennessy USA.",US

10984,France,Smoky and minerally on the nose--like when you strike two pieces of flint together. But there are also ripe fruit flavors of honey and pink grapefruit and a richness of texture that's usually lacking in Petit Chablis. Such a vivid expression of minerality is hard to find at this price.,France
10985,France,"An intense nose of toasted walnuts and vanilla is balanced by a palate full of tart pear and lemon fruit. The citrusy finish lingers, picking up smoke and spice notes that turn slightly drying. Try in 2002.",US

10988,France,"Soft and citrusy, with streaks of lime and mineral and a surprisingly long, Burgundian finish. Clean and steely, with no trace of oak. The fine ripe fruit speaks volumes. Best Buy.",US
10989,France,"Fresh, tight and properly crisp, there’s nothing here to put it in the California-blowsy category. Stone-fruit aromas lead into peach and green-apple flavors. Not much depth, but plenty of refreshing fruit and palate-cleansing verve. Best Buy.",France

10991,France,"Pleasant, pale, fairly thin and tart, with lemony fruit and a simple finish.",US

10994,France,"A nice perfume and crisp, well-defined stony and green apple flavors are attributes of this classified Chablis. Medium-weight, it has a good texture and structure. It finishes tight, with classic Chablis citrus and chalk notes. Appealing now, it should be even better in a year or two. Editors' Choice",France

10996,France,"Nice tension shows in the floral, peach and stony aromas of this estate wine. It has a lean frame and taut spine, but good fruit, too, with the gentle peachy notes balancing the crisp edge. Closes clean, with citrus and spice.

11010,France,"A full masculine nose of lime and hazelnut opens this solid offering. Restrained orange, peach and toasty oak flavors are displayed elegantly on the full, richly textured palate. Feels mature and ready to drink. Finishes with mineral, peach and oak notes.",France
11011,France,"Firm, structured wine which at present tastes young and rather unfocused. It is certainly rich and should develop well. The wood element is dominant at the end, but the fruit should come through to sustain it. The wine needs aging.",France
